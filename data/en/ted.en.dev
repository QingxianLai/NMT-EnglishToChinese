here 's a jelly .
they 're very little understood .
and we 're over the atlantic -- that 's the ridge right there -- but we 're going to go across the caribbean , central america , and end up against the pacific , nine degrees north .
we weren 't really aware that it would be so rich with sulfides , hydrogen sulfides .
now , they normally retract as soon as a crab touches them .
you can see this shrimp is harassing this poor little guy here , and he 'll bat it away with his claw . whack !
all this stuff is happening along that 40,000-mile long mountain range that we 're calling the ribbon of life , because just even today , as we speak , there 's life being generated there from volcanic activity .
there are a number of groups that are proposing that life evolved at these vent sites .
the continents move apart . they come back together .
i 'm sick and tired of us being last .
so it 's no surprise , guys , that 62 percent of bulgarians are not optimistic about the future .
social : 45 years of what ?
i 'm going to give bebko to baba .
autocratic -- do what i say because i 'm the chef .
throughout the animal kingdom , for example : ants . ants play .
and who are the biggest neotenists ?
little exercise just for a second : close your eyes and try to imagine a world without play .
it increases our openness to change .
no way . we 're different . "
there 's nothing holding us back , except our own mentality about play .
you know what , let them use their mobile phone for personal calls -- heaven forbid .
thank you .
and we took a very special angle to this .
we all want to be there , in the upper right quadrant , where performance is strong and learning opportunities are equally distributed .
last but not least , koreans want their teachers not only to teach but also to develop .
and the bitter truth really is that , you know , not in many countries .
well , if you only focus on your brightest students , you know what happens is disparities grow , and you can see this bubble moving slightly to the other direction , but still , an impressive improvement .
those things really exist .
and they provide intelligent pathways for teachers to grow in their careers .
last but not least , those countries align policies across all areas of public policy .
they wrote almost a thousand pages on the topic .
and we perform dozens of integrations in order to understand what 's happening .
and as a body of knowledge builds up , it will form one subsection , or one sub-subsection of an assessment like the ipcc , although we have others .
we 're going to do it non-invasively using mri .
they 're learning to flex this system that releases their own endogenous opiates .
indeed , it is hard to find a subject that film has yet to tackle .
i had seen the film on the occasion of my father 's 50th birthday .
they celebrated a change in attitude towards non-white britons , but railed against our restless school system that does not value collective identity , unlike that offered by sidney poitier 's careful tutelage .
quite recently she told me that in 1948 , two of her sisters and my father traveled on a boat to israel without my grandparents .
and though not real , eve harrington , howard beale , mildred pierce are an opportunity to discover what it is to be human , and no less helpful to understanding our life and times as shakespeare is in illuminating the world of elizabethan england .
it 's a movement that -- it advocates making biotechnology accessible to everyone , not just scientists and people in government labs .
we work in groups , in big cities — — and in small villages .
now , it could happen , but i 'm not going to plan my life around it .
you can send weather balloons up into the stratosphere , collect microbes , see what 's up there .
what is a chubby , curly-haired guy from holland -- why is he whistling ?
she googled , and she found this world whistling championship in america , of course .
well actually , you are going to whistle along .
i start it myself .
so as part of the demonstration , what i have is a pair of gloves , and we 've coated one of the gloves with the nanotechnology coating , and let 's see if you can tell which one , and i 'll give you a hint .
the applications in a general sense could be anything that 's anti-wetting .
do you rip it off quickly -- short duration but high intensity -- or do you take your band-aid off slowly -- you take a long time , but each second is not as painful -- which one of those is the right approach ?
i kept on doing this for a while .
other people i would tempt to cheat .
some people shredded everything , went out of the room , and paid themselves from the bowl of money that had over 100 dollars .
and this is particularly interesting , because mit doesn 't have an honor code .
but this did not solve the big problem i had with enron yet , because in enron , there 's also a social element .
it turns out it depends on what kind of sweatshirt they 're wearing .
would they not be able to see it this way ?
i felt my intuition was correct . "
so for example , states compete very vigorously to attract new auto plants or expanded auto plants .
so when we invest in other people 's children , and build up those skills , we increase the overall job growth of a metro area .
and maybe michigan will be thinking about investing in preschool in ann arbor , michigan , and be worried these little wolverines will end up moving to ohio and becoming buckeyes .
and if we want to translate that from just billions of dollars to something that might mean something , what we 're talking about is that , for the average low-income kid , that would increase earnings by about 10 percent over their whole career , just doing the preschool , not improving k-12 or anything else after that , not doing anything with college tuition or access , just directly improving preschool , and we would get five percent higher earnings for middle-class kids .
but music is even more powerful if you don 't just listen to it , but you make it yourself .
it 's very , very important .
they 're manipulating each other 's rhythms .
even though they 're cubes , they actually have a lot of personality .
tod machover : and we 're really excited to have you here , really dan .
do they provide structure for us to do that ? and , you know , that 's a personal relationship to expression that is lacking in the technological sphere . so , you know , with dan , we needed a new design process , a new engineering process to sort of discover his movement and his path to expression that allow him to perform .
yeah .
and it 's been very exciting .
it 's not as big as a gothic cathedral , so he can write things that are a little bit more intricate .
this is carnegie hall .
well , there 's only so many times you can play the same section of a song over and over again for the dancers .
so at this point , music diverged .
but now that 's evolved into something else .
and i thought : well , if this is a model for creation , if we make music , primarily the form at least , to fit these contexts , and if we make art to fit gallery walls or museum walls , and if we write software to fit existing operating systems , is that how it works ?
and in the life that everyone sees , who i am is a friend , a son , a brother , a stand-up comedian and a teenager .
we don 't see it on the news , because it 's not happy , it 's not fun , it 's not light .
i feared my truth , i feared my honesty , i feared my vulnerability , and that fear made me feel like i was forced into a corner , like i was forced into a corner and there was only one way out , and so i thought about that way every single day .
and i don 't know what the solution is .
we 're not perfect , and that 's okay .
so i come to the computer and i start looking on , and suddenly i see many people talking to me , most of them i don 't know , and a few of them from iran , which is -- what ?
i mean , so many pictures , so i asked friends to come , graphic designers most of them , to make posters with me , because i didn 't have the time .
and they just came , and it was so much , i remember one day , michal , she was talking with the journalist , and she was asking him , " who 's gonna see the show ? " and he said , " everybody . "
so for five months now , that 's what we are doing , me , michal , a few of my friends , are just making images .
at some point we met in real life , and we became friends .
so i want to ask michal , my wife , to come with me on the stage just to make with you one image , because it 's all about images .
half of each year 's 100 billion pounds of thermal plastic pellets will be made into fast-track trash .
sadly , their parents mistake bottle caps for food tossing about in the ocean surface .
we sort the plastic fragments into different size classes , from five millimeters to one-third of a millimeter .
charles moore : thank you .
although at the same time we 're losing an equivalent amount of existing arables to salinization and erosion .
they were surrounded by productive farm land and dominated by large temple complexes like this one at ur , that were , in fact , effectively , spiritualized , central food distribution centers .
and the same of course was true for fish .
and then 10 years later everything changed .
we don 't smell food to see if it 's okay to eat .
it was a kind of joke , because it 's got a double derivation from the greek .
it 's part of the social life of the city .
and i think the message of this is very clear .
when this trailer showed up at my shop in berkeley , i 'd actually never stepped foot in an airstream trailer , or any other trailer .
they also gave us a way to run power and rewire the trailer without tearing out the skin , so they function as an electrical chase .
the trailers themselves are actually hand-built .
in fact , imagine something even worse .
in your house , wires run in the wall , from the light switch to a junction box in the ceiling and from the junction box to the light bulb .
we take nerves that are noisy and active that should be quiet , and we put them to sleep with local anesthetics .
so today i 'm going to take you on a voyage to cast light on some of the outdated myths and legends and assumptions that have kept us as the true stakeholders in the high seas in the dark .
but we also spent many hours in the basements of the united nations , trying to work with governments to make them understand what was going on so far away from land that few of us had ever even imagined that these creatures existed .
it 's considered high seas , because the continent has been put off limits to territorial claims .
so a place like the costa rica dome could not technically qualify the time it 's in the high seas .
which leads me to my second passion besides ocean science , which is outer space technology .
so on this tour , i hope i provided you with a new perspective of the high seas : one , that it is our home too , and that we need to work together if we are to make this a sustainable ocean future for us all .
there was no cure , and there was no vaccine .
and in both cases , we were able to use genetic sequencing to look at the polio viruses , and we could tell these viruses were not from these countries .
so we are trying to wipe out this virus completely .
the vast majority of people who are infected with the polio virus show absolutely no sign of the disease .
and then , by 1999 , one of the three polio viruses that we were trying to eradicate had been completely eradicated worldwide -- proof of concept .
these are children like umar .
and then they can track them , and at the end of the day , they look and see , did these guys get every single street , every single house .
india 's not unique .
help us build the momentum so that very soon every child , every parent everywhere can also take for granted a polio-free life forever .
we have a big gap in that money . we 're cutting corners , and every time we cut corners , more places get infected that shouldn 't have , and it just slows us down .
" i found these stamps as a child , and i have been waiting all my life to have someone to send them to .
we all heard you pee . "
but she finally did .
the other pictures are of my very ill grandmother .
frank , that was beautiful , so touching .
it didn 't matter what she was crying about , she could get on my knee , she could snot my sleeve up , just cry , cry it out .
we lived in the bronx at the time , and the burial was in a place called long island , it was about two hours outside of the city .
he was a troubled kid .
now my box , my card , my man box card , was immediately in jeopardy .
so he was offering me the opportunity to do the same .
so quickly , i 'd like to just say , this is the love of my life , my daughter jay .
and it 's painful enough now -- and i think it 's designed this way -- it 's painful enough so you want to jump .
and then when it 's time to go , a green light goes and the jumpmaster goes , " go . "
it 's this elegant little land , twist and roll .
and i was raised to believe that soldiers were strong and wise and brave and faithful ; they didn 't lie , cheat , steal or abandon their comrades .
more importantly , the force that i led was spread over more than 20 countries .
probably the biggest change was understanding that the generational difference , the ages , had changed so much .
i said , " where is he now ? "
we were in a difficult operation in afghanistan in 2007 , and an old friend of mine , that i had spent many years at various points of my career with -- godfather to one of their kids -- he sent me a note , just in an envelope , that had a quote from sherman to grant that said , " i knew if i ever got in a tight spot , that you would come , if alive . "
my wife replied , " none of your business . "
i need a woman volunteer . where can i get one in india ?
that makes me bow down to any woman in front of me to give full respect . that five days i 'll never forget -- the messy days , the lousy days , that wetness .
it is the same in the 21st century . that 's why i am going to decide to give this machine only for poor women across india .
i 'm doing something serious .
what is the future of the human race ?
these predictions are in excellent agreement with observations by the wmap satellite of the cosmic microwave background , which is an imprint of the very early universe .
if we are the only intelligent beings in the galaxy , we should make sure we survive and continue .
professor , we really thank you for the extraordinary effort you made to share your questions with us today .
and what an alive man terence bryan foley turned out to be .
two years go by .
so we fought , we struggled , we triumphed .
i knew terence 's wishes as clearly and as surely as i knew my own .
i saw it firsthand .
we have a noble path to curing the disease , patients and doctors alike , but there doesn 't seem to be a noble path to dying .
the overwhelming presence of hope isn 't denial .
most africans today , by far , are farmers .
did africa feed itself ?
in africa , small farmers bear the brunt of this risk .
when conditions are right , we know and see that that innovation is ready to explode in rural africa , just like anywhere else .
similarly , there 's been explosive growth in india , for example , where rural farmers are using exchanges -- growing here over the last three years by 270 percent a year .
what this does is transforms , fundamentally , the farmers ' relationship to the market .
so the potential is there .
i said , " amy , amy , wait . don 't cry . don 't cry .
and we know that 's a measurement error because it 's messing up my data .
what that 's doing is creating something called the medical school syndrome -- which , if you know people who 've been to medical school , during the first year of medical training , as you read through a list of all the symptoms and diseases that could happen , suddenly you realize you have all of them .
this is hogwart 's from the movie " harry potter " and that 's harvard .
what you 've done is you 've outlined all the negative things that can happen , but not talked about the positive . "
which means we can reverse the formula .
at the same time , if you think about it , there 's all kinds of strange behaviors in the world around us .
he stayed late at night every day .
and this other condition we called the sisyphic condition .
so there was not a real opportunity for big meaning .
and this was a group within this software company that was put in a different building .
but if you understood how important meaning is , then you would figure out that it 's actually important to spend some time , energy and effort in getting people to care more about what they 're doing .
you shred people 's efforts , output , you get them not to be as happy with what they 're doing .
i can 't say enjoy those pieces .
now i think a little bit like the ikea effect , by getting people to work harder , they actually got them to love what they 're doing to a higher degree .
for some people we made it harder by hiding the instructions .
how much would you pay for them now ?
i think that as we move to situations in which people have to decide on their own about how much effort , attention , caring , how connected they feel to it , are they thinking about labor on the way to work and in the shower and so on , all of a sudden marx has more things to say to us .
so this -- the perfect solution for time-starved professionals who want to , you know , salute the sun , but only want to give over about 20 minutes to it .
and by the time i got off that plane , i 'd decided i wanted to do something about it .
and i guess that the question is , is it possible to break free from that mindset ?
sex . there 's an awful lot of fast sex around , isn 't there ?
but thankfully , there is a backlash there in parenting as well , and you 're finding that , you know , towns in the united states are now banding together and banning extracurriculars on a particular day of the month , so that people can , you know , decompress and have some family time , and slow down .
are politicians making good decisions on my behalf ?
i play squash and ice hockey , two very fast sports , and i wouldn 't give them up for the world .
and he said to me , or he handed this to me , and i read it , and it said , " to daddy , love benjamin . "
but it is a place where sex workers and their clients come .
it 's people back home , people that support their work , people like these .
and how will they cope in a foreign land ?
we need better planning and systems for evacuation .
sea level rise threatens coastal ecosystems , agriculture , even major cities . this is what one to two meters of sea level rise looks like in the mekong delta .
why ? well , there are no experts .
this is something that has editing and it has teams .
our mandate is media , and particularly the book . "
on the left of that diagram , here , you 'll see a series of five platforms -- sort of combs , collective programs .
one , it is the lateral stability for the entire building ; it is a structural element . but its dimensions were designed not only for structure , but also for holding on every piece of glass .
she said yes .
and it allowed us to go back to first principles , and redefine fly tower , acoustic enclosure , light enclosure and so forth .
this also is an unusual client .
so our strategy was very simple .
chris asked me to add -- the theater is under construction , and this project will start construction in about a year , and finish in 2010 .
and here is that characteristic .
are these so bad that they outweigh condemning 100,000 people a day to an unnecessarily early death ?
but of course , that only works when we have both of these components .
in fact , we have a pitifully poor understanding of how organisms work -- even cells we 're not really too good on yet .
i think this is a reasonable sequence of events that happened in the progression of the technology of powered flight .
so , these trajectories here are basically how we would expect people to live , in terms of remaining life expectancy , as measured by their health , for given ages that they were at the time that these therapies arrive .
and thirdly , the question is , what will it do to actually how much people want it ?
because we can re-draw our original diagram this way .
they 're categories of things , of course , but there 's only seven of them .
so , you know , you 've got to actually do your homework , in order to understand whether this is true .
i 'm going to tell you the genuine mainstream answer to your question , which i happen to agree with , which is that , no , aging is not a product of selection , evolution ; [ aging ] is simply a product of evolutionary neglect .
last year when i was here , i was speaking to you about a swim which i did across the north pole .
and so i decided to walk up to mt . everest , the highest mountain on this earth , and go and do a symbolic swim underneath the summit of mt . everest .
i then began to choke , and then it quickly led to me vomiting in the water .
and remember , never ever swim with aggression .
now , i 'm sure you recognize this object ; many of you probably saw it as you were landing your private zeppelins at los angeles international airport over the past couple of days .
okay , what is this object ?
and you didn 't even notice it happened .
but that 's when i take out his letters and i read them , and the paper that touched his hand is in mine , and i feel connected to him .
but what was striking to me over the last several years was that less and less was i going out into the world , and more and more , i was sitting in front of my computer screen .
could i go there ? who would i meet ?
but in the other dimension they are incredibly expansive , as expansive as you can imagine .
it seemed like there was a moment when the continent was being plugged in , and i wanted to see that .
thanks .
the self : you are self-aware .
no culture , no nation and nationalism -- nothing can touch it because it is empathy .
the subject -- " me " -- and the object -- the scheme of things -- fuse into oneness , an experience nobody can say , " i am denied of , " an experience common to all and sundry .
and the wholeness is the reality of you when you relate to the world .
you act compassionately .
in 2010 , there was a ted event called mission blue held aboard the lindblad explorer in the galapagos as part of the fulfillment of sylvia earle 's ted wish .
it 's a scream for help , a last-ditch attempt for escape , and a common form of defense in the deep sea .
innovation drives economic growth .
woman 4 : google " jellyfish . "
my vision when we started google 15 years ago was that eventually you wouldn 't have to have a search query at all .
and with this , i know i will get certain messages if i really need them , but i don 't have to be checking them all the time .
i 've always been a technology nut , and i absolutely love it .
the guy had a duplicate headset for me to listen to .
it 's more like joining a club where you pay dues every year .
and we 've arrived at the age of interface matrices , where there are so many features and options , you have to do two dimensions , you know : a vertical and a horizontal . you guys all complained about how microsoft word is always bulleting your lists and underlining your links automatically .
but i beg of the designers here to break all those rules if they violate the biggest rule of all , which is intelligence . now what do i mean by that ?
i 'm going to show you an example of a company that does not have a tap counter .
i write the code that fits the world today .
all that you see is a kid in his teens who started out in a garage with only a buddy named woz .
i 've got just a couple examples . physically , a really cool , elegant , thinking coming along lately .
so that 's my dirty little secret . don 't tell anyone .
in my childhood , i played around in my father 's university lab .
let 's talk about what 's suddenly possible .
dan jurafsky : does lufthansa serve breakfast and san jose ? well , that sounds funny .
they could present that certificate to a prospective employer and get a better job , and we know many students who did .
so they get to try again , and this time they got it right .
so we tried to convince , for example , some of our humanities faculty that multiple choice was not such a bad strategy .
this is the san francisco study group , but there were ones all over the world .
the first is the population that studied in a lecture-based classroom .
i think what he was complaining about is not universities but rather the lecture-based format that so many universities spend so much time on .
the first time i left was to meet a friend for lunch .
and she said , " yeah . "
and that myth is profoundly dangerous .
the second thing , in addition to really finally understanding the relationship between vulnerability and courage , the second thing i learned is this : we have to talk about shame .
and i thought , thank god , because shame is this horrible topic , no one wants to talk about it .
and all-powerful folks don 't need checklists .
there 's a great quote that saved me this past year by theodore roosevelt .
shame is a focus on self , guilt is a focus on behavior .
shame feels the same for men and women , but it 's organized by gender .
and don 't tell me it 's from the guys and the coaches and the dads , because the women in my life are harder on me than anyone else . "
we want you to go in .
i had also had the privilege since the last 37 years to work on several masterpieces as you can see behind me , but basically to do what ? well , to assess , for example , the state of conservation . see here the face of the madonna of the chair that when just shining a uv light on it you suddenly see another , different lady , aged lady , i should rather say .
so all we need is one finger . just wipe off and we see the elephant .
you can see my little video there conducting these people , alone in their dorm rooms or in their living rooms at home .
and then my question became , am i the only one who does this ?
and i 'm treating you , my inner circle , like you 're the enemy .
and maybe somebody 's never said that to you , but you 've done a really , really good job .
this is the wmap microwave background that we see .
this is nepal .
so i travel the globe , and what i 'm noticing is that everywhere where romanticism has entered , there seems to be a crisis of desire .
how do they relate , and how do they conflict ?
but then the second group is even more interesting : i am most drawn to my partner when i see him in the studio , when she is onstage , when he is in his element , when she 's doing something she 's passionate about , when i see him at a party and other people are really drawn to him , when i see her hold court .
what parts of you are just being seen ?
what are the ingredients ? imagination , playfulness , novelty , curiosity , mystery .
if everybody was fantasizing on a bed of roses , we wouldn 't be having such interesting talks about this .
are you going to be angry with me ? "
they know how to bring it back , and they know how to bring it back because they have demystified one big myth , which is the myth of spontaneity , which is that it 's just going to fall from heaven while you 're folding the laundry like a deus ex machina , and in fact they understood that whatever is going to just happen in a long-term relationship already has .
and our prison system itself is stuck .
this is mr. lopez , who has been in solitary confinement for 18 months , and he 's providing input on the types of images that he believes would make him and his fellow inmates more serene , more calm , less apt to violence .
so you can probably piece the rest together .
we 're free to choose where we make the fold .
and all of this expounds the scope of forms that we can produce .
a challenge to me was how we could express this new algorithmic order in a column .
but enough of the theory .
each column is effectively a hybrid of two columns .
for days after the launch , sputnik was a wonderful curiosity .
and i 'd like to thank you all .
it starts at base camp , at 17,500 feet .
this is me crossing a crevasse .
this is a picture of rob hall .
and there were climbers on that summit ridge .
rob hall , we heard by radio , was up here , at this point in the storm with doug hansen .
and they all came by me so i could take a look at them and see what i could do for them , which is really not much , because camp three is a little notch cut in the ice in the middle of a 45-degree angle .
this was my medical kit .
he said he had gotten lost in the storm , collapsed in the snow , and just laid there , unable to move .
this is a roughly normal scan , showing equal distribution of energy .
this is where people make decisions , where they develop willpower .
these are serphas lighting juniper branches .
so for example , in the united kingdom , the incidence of childhood leukemia has risen by 20 percent just in a generation .
in some cases , another species like the north american leopard frog showed that males exposed to atrazine grew eggs in their testes .
and what 's interesting about bpa is that it 's such a potent estrogen that it was actually once considered for use as a synthetic estrogen in hormone placement therapy .
the evidence of that is that studies in rats , again with atrazine , show that the hormone imbalance atrazine generates causes abortion .
never heard of it .
and of course , we don 't do these experiments in humans , but just by coincidence , my colleague has shown that men who have low sperm count , low semen quality have significantly more atrazine in their urine .
thank you .
there are things that you stand for .
now those of you who have done this will realize that this is no walk in the park .
now the question here is , where do we go from here ?
i 'm a novelist , and i 'm interested in the self because the self and fiction have a lot in common .
all of this to say that the gap between what we can perceive and what we can measure is only going to widen .
are you reading an interview by an author ?
possibly , but i remember my childhood .
i wanted to learn to cook , and she kept me in the kitchen , cutting , cubing and chopping for a whole month .
and on the very first day our counselor gathered us all together and she taught us a cheer that she said we would be doing every day for the rest of the summer to instill camp spirit .
now this is what many introverts do , and it 's our loss for sure , but it is also our colleagues ' loss and our communities ' loss .
and kids are working in countless group assignments .
but many of us do recognize ourselves as one type or the other .
you might be following the person with the best ideas , but you might not .
that 's our cultural inheritance .
but here 's the thing about my grandfather .
and i want to be clear about what i 'm saying , because i deeply believe our offices should be encouraging casual , chatty cafe-style types of interactions -- you know , the kind where people come together and serendipitously have an exchange of ideas .
thank you . thank you .
or " what 's this num lock key for ? " you know , that thing ?
and then finally , the leaf lamp for herman miller .
but how we work on jawbone is really unique .
thank you .
you know , all these great technologies really happened because of the passion and the olpc people and the engineers .
it 's a little bit like designing a fire hydrant , and it has to be easily serviceable : you have to know where it is and what it does .
neil and i were sitting there comparing how little we 've slept in anticipation for this . i 've never been so nervous -- and i do this when i 'm nervous , i just realized .
all these people that had sort of flexible daily hours and an interest in the english word -- i hope to have an interest in the english language , but i 'm not speaking it well right now .
and we looked around and somebody else said , " well , you should sell supplies to the working buccaneer . "
it was started with about 12 of my friends , people that i had known for years that were writers in the neighborhood .
kids weren 't going into the " center-for-kids-that-need-more-help , " or something like that . it was 826 valencia .
there you have it , you know -- one-on-one attention .
the neighborhood 's going to tell us , the parents are going to tell us .
she 's going to publish them in a book .
it was making a lot of money . not a lot of money , but it was paying the rent , paying a full-time staff member there .
and this was to make it look sort of like one of those keysmith 's shops that has to have every service they 've ever offered , you know , all over there .
i just came and visited and said , " yes , you guys are doing great , " or whatever . that was it . you can see the time in all five boroughs of new york in the back .
so , i 'll go through really quickly .
so , this is with hot studio in san francisco , they did this phenomenal job .
we altered our ecological niche by creating civilization .
a cama is a camel-llama hybrid , created to try to get the hardiness of a camel with some of the personality traits of a llama .
they did it with pigs .
he actually was the first person to clone a dog , which is a very difficult thing to do , because dog genomes are very plastic .
and it raises the question of how we 're going to define animal species in the age of biotechnology -- a question that we 're not really sure yet how to solve .
they have it running through mazes , controlling where it 's going .
finally , mussa-ivaldi of northwestern took a completely intact , independent lamprey eel brain .
for the first time in the history of this planet , we are able to directly design organisms .
instead of wheels , a ballbot is balancing and moving on one single ball .
i can also make him spin .
if you don 't , you 're not alone .
the radiologists were , in turn , criticized for protecting their own financial self-interest .
that 's why mammograms find over 80 percent of tumors in fatty breasts , but as few as 40 percent in extremely dense breasts .
it 's just way too much equipment .
and i started talking to him about this problem with breast density , and we realized that we might be able to get this detector close enough around the breast to actually find small tumors .
you can see , on the right , a mammogram showing a faint tumor , the edges of which are blurred by the dense tissue .
it 's also older women with dense tissue .
of course we should .
there are an enormous number of them that we use every day .
and this small system actually prints it out -- so it actually acts like a paper input-output system , just made out of paper .
i took it very literally , and took my bike helmet , put a little cut over there so that the projector actually fits nicely .
so , we are looking for an era where computing will actually merge with the physical world .
so now the sound of the touch is getting me when exactly i 'm touching the paper .
what are you doing with this ? is there a company being planned ?
based on the people we 've seen at ted , i would say you 're truly one of the two or three best inventors in the world right now .
bf : shut up .
oh , good . all right .
dh : wow , you 've been working out .
bf : we 've got one more we 're going to do .
impossible , you say ?
just trying to play the odds . all right , here we go .
dh : all right , we 'll try again .
dh : that 's right .
bf : it is , it 's weird . you wouldn 't think it would affect half the stage , but it is . it 's weird .
dh : whenever you 're ready there , big guy .
common injuries can lead to decades of pain , until our joints quite literally grind to a halt .
and the tissue 's very expensive .
how are we going to revolutionize artificial joint replacement ?
and i would like to know what the audience is , and so who of you ever ate insects ?
so insects , just for free , contribute to the economy of the united states with about the same order of magnitude , just for free , without everyone knowing .
and now you may think , okay , in this provincial town in china they 're doing that , but not us .
one gram of gold is 30 euros .
they have the same share that we have .
we 're not taking the nine kilograms of output yet .
that 's not only the land where the livestock is walking and feeding , but it 's also other areas where the feed is being produced and being transported .
and i 'm working very hard with my colleague , arnold van huis , in telling people what insects are , what magnificent things they are , what magnificent jobs they do in nature .
i think soon it will not be big news anymore when we all eat insects , because it 's just a normal way of doing .
perfect .
and it 's the very same people leading wall street firms who , on sundays , show up and share .
so here he is beginning .
all of our normal social interactions become a kind of invitation to this sort of collective expression .
this man was a remixer extraordinaire .
now , i think there are lessons we should learn here , lessons about openness .
i answered , " no . " i didn 't even think about it .
the president , who has supported a process that secretly negotiates agreements , which effectively lock us into the insane system of dmca that we have adopted and likely lock us down a path of three strikes , you 're out that , of course , the rest of the world are increasingly adopting .
mainly indian , pakistani , sri lankan and nepalese , these laborers risk everything to make money for their families back home .
and that as we worry about our next job in the office , the next design that we can get , to keep our workers .
these guys are blown up a couple million times .
but that 's not the only way that viruses infect bacteria .
it kills me . i 'm not kidding .
it 's like science has become that horrible storyteller that we all know , who gives us all the details nobody cares about , where you 're like , " oh , i met my friend for lunch the other day , and she was wearing these ugly jeans .
so we are so lucky that we have resources like the internet , where we can circumvent these institutions from the bottom up .
and at that sushi bar we came up with a great idea .
our vice president of operation kissing the board . obviously very , very excited .
wait till you see , maybe next year , what kind of windows we 've invented .
because i was so poor , i wanted to rent an office in paris , but i couldn 't afford it , so i decided to bring my students to paris to build our office on top of the pompidou center in paris by ourselves .
so that is why i started working in disaster areas .
they were living like this with very poor plastic sheets in the park .
in 2004 , in sri lanka , after the sumatra earthquake and tsunami , i rebuilt islamic fishermen 's villages .
however , some of the facility authority doesn 't want us to do it , because , they said , simply , it 's become more difficult to control them .
we all have come from a long way , here in africa , and converged in this region of africa , which is a place where 90 percent of our evolutionary process took place .
and dna analysis of living humans and chimpanzees teaches us today that we diverged sometime around seven million years ago and that these two species share over 98 percent of the same genetic material .
a very important environmental lesson could be learned from this .
it took five years .
and to know how old she was when she died , what you do is you do an informed estimate , and you say , how much time would be required to form this amount of teeth , and the answer was three .
this is called the hyoid bone . it 's a bone which is right here .
and they were probably not aware of this future legacy , but they did great .
it 's named after latin for " seahorse , " which it resembles .
and when you expand the box , the firing location expands .
but now as the rat explores around , each individual cell fires in a whole array of different locations which are laid out across the environment in an amazingly regular triangular grid .
so if this was happening , your memories could start by place cells activating each other via these dense interconnections and then reactivating boundary cells to create the spatial structure of the scene around your viewpoint .
josh .
but the trouble is so many people talk so much rubbish about work-life balance .
have sex .
a fourth observation : we need to approach balance in a balanced way .
so i left work an hour early that afternoon and picked harry up at the school gates .
so , i 'm going to argue that this is an illusion -- that the separation between science and human values is an illusion -- and actually quite a dangerous one at this point in human history .
there are truths to be known about how human communities flourish , whether or not we understand these truths .
for instance , there are 21 states in our country where corporal punishment in the classroom is legal , where it is legal for a teacher to beat a child with a wooden board , hard , and raising large bruises and blisters and even breaking the skin .
now , why wouldn 't this undermine an objective morality ?
and who are we to say , even , that they 're wrong to beat them with lengths of steel cable , or throw battery acid in their faces if they decline the privilege of being smothered in this way ?
now , what stands in the way of this ?
but this is just the point .
whether in this audience or people elsewhere in the world , hearing some of this , may well be doing the screaming-with-rage thing , after as well , some of them .
and if the results come out that actually they do , are you prepared to shift your instinctive current judgment on some of these issues ?
is it different women who are doing the preserving and the radicalizing ?
late that night , i heard my mother begging my father , " please do something ramu . can 't you intervene ? "
had i heard right ?
and i smile , and i nod , realizing i 'm watching women and girls using their own religious traditions and practices , turning them into instruments of opposition and opportunity .
bosnians , croats and serbs find a rare shared space of pride in their history , and lesbor reminds them that the songs one group often claims as theirs alone really belong to them all .
eventually , opposing forces in liberia were pushed to hold peace talks in ghana .
they 've also saved me from my righteous anger by offering insights into this third way .
we can wear a sari or a hijab or pants or a boubou , and we can be party leaders and presidents and human rights lawyers .
this might strike you as a strange career move , but it actually has one great advantage : no job competition .
you guys are answering the question : how does it feel to realize you 're wrong ?
you 're sitting there in class , and your teacher is handing back quiz papers , and one of them looks like this .
and she wakes up , and she looks down at herself , and she says , " why is the wrong side of my body in bandages ? "
but to me , what 's most baffling and most tragic about this is that it misses the whole point of being human .
but a couple of months later , i actually had a chance to interview ira glass , who 's the host of the show .
no offense , but this entire conference is an unbelievable monument to our capacity to get stuff wrong .
this girl happened to be the only girl in the entire village who had made it to the ninth grade .
dirt poor , no money , living with my parents , i again said , " no . "
great people have made commitments -- we will protect our children from want and from fear .
one day she said to me , " my wish is to finish college and be able to support my children . "
so i will do this .
but sadly , the vision of a great future , or the dream of a great future , is just a dream , because you have all of these vices .
but not only did they do that , they went to those who were running for seats to ask them , " what is it that you will give the girls of this community when you win ? "
in the ongoing debate about globalization , what 's been missing is the voices of the workers themselves .
but like so many theories that marx arrived at sitting in the reading room of the british museum , he got this one wrong .
min 's sister said to her parents , " in america , this bag sells for 320 dollars . "
she recently returned to dongguan on her own to take a job in a factory that makes construction cranes , temporarily leaving her husband and children back in the village .
so , if you really want to help these workers , start these small , very focused , very pragmatic classes in these schools , and what 's going to happen is , all your workers are going to move on , but hopefully they 'll move on into higher jobs within apple , and you can help their social mobility and their self-improvement .
but today , this thing is , i believe , a major player in the politics of the middle east .
cyrus , king of the persians , has entered babylon without a fight -- the great empire of babylon , which ran from central southern iraq to the mediterranean , falls to cyrus .
who is there among you of his people ?
it left a dream of the middle east as a unit , and a unit where people of different faiths could live together .
the babylonian cylinder is written by the priests of the great god of bablyon , marduk .
40 years on and we 're in 1917 , and the cylinder enters a different world .
they want to borrow the cyrus cylinder .
it is a document that can mean so many things , for iran and for the region .
i said that was stupid , you know , maybe we should just train them to do something useful .
they 're found everywhere on the planet except for the arctic and the southern tip of south america .
but she did it all on her own .
so we know that these crows are really smart , but the more i dug into this , the more i found that they actually have an even more significant adaptation .
we found out they 're really smart , and we found out that they can teach each other .
the crows learn that all they have to do is show up , wait for the coin to come out , put the coin in the slot , and then they get their peanut .
the main thing , the main point of all this for me is that we can find mutually beneficial systems for these species .
and it 's within these tribes that all of our work gets done .
if you can find a way to take the tribes that you 're in and nudge them forward , along these tribal stages to what we call stage five , which is the top of the mountain .
and the reason that that 's relevant is that very soon i will be walking into what we call a stage two tribe , which looks like this .
now imagine having a whole room of people saying , in effect , " i 'm great and you 're not . "
it was not christmas time . there was a christmas tree .
and if you take a look at the headline of stage five , which is " life is great , " this may seem a little incongruous .
" my life sucks because i live under a tyrant , also known as king george .
tribes can only hear one level above and below where they are .
see , people who build world-changing tribes do that .
you 're in tribes here . hopefully you 're extending the reach of the tribes that you have .
i experienced this firsthand as a high school student in uganda .
do you know how many species of flowering plants there are ?
but most species actually use insects to do their bidding , and that 's more intelligent in a way , because the pollen , they don 't need so much of it .
now this is a plant .
and this one doesn 't have anything for them .
they drink this fabulous nectar and then they 're all a bit sticky .
but if you look at the spectrum , birds and us , we see red , green and blue and see that spectrum .
so maybe the chemical in that would be useful .
we are all born artists .
for example , a kid says , " mom , guess what ? i met an alien on my way home . "
a kid who has just started to lie is taking the first step as a storyteller .
work doesn 't make you happy , does it ? mostly it 's tough .
i was trying my best , and my teacher came around and asked me , " what are you doing ? "
most of the works have no title , untitled .
or some people dance in clubs .
right this minute , we can turn off tv , log off the internet , get up and start to do something .
it will say a lot of things .
it helps us express ourselves and be happy without the help of alcohol or drugs .
wow . i was touched .
enjoy it while it lasts .
it was still 1991 .
you know , in my defense , there was no google at that time ; you could not just google in ' 91 .
so i had absolutely no idea how that could actually work .
but however you put it , you know , the numbers do not make any sense .
you see we started working in eastern and central europe , and moved to russia .
so what the governor got was an empty shell .
imagine two thirds over here running excellent organizations , doing very important work .
put all of those bonds at one place and they sit down and click .
but i think that actually , despite our gaps , we really have a lot in common .
the diameter of each dot represents the length of the sentence inside , so that the large dots contain large sentences , and the small dots contain small sentences .
this grid is then said to represent the picture of the world 's feelings in the last few hours , if you will .
here are gender , age , weather , location .
so as you can see , we feel fine uses a technique that i call " passive observation . "
you know : weddings , births , funerals , the first car , the first kiss , the first camel or horse -- depending on the culture .
and you 'll see that it leads with a shifting star field , and there 's an aurora borealis in the background , kind of morphing with color . the color of the aurora borealis can be controlled using this single bar of color at the bottom , and we 'll put it down here to red .
we can click on one of those and have the photograph be the center of the universe .
so we see that he was a bit quiet on saturday , but he was back to work on sunday morning , and actually been tapering off since then this week .
and the central , but not all-important , role of competition and survival of the fittest shrinks just a little bit to make room .
not created by the printing press , but enabled by the collective action that emerges from literacy .
here 's how the game is played : there are two players ; they 've never played the game before , they will not play the game again , they don 't know each other , and they are , in fact , in separate rooms .
and again , our notions of individuals as economic beings have been overturned .
wikipedia has used thousands of volunteers to create a free encyclopedia with a million and a half articles in 200 languages in just a couple of years .
thank you .
so what 's new in it ? what seems to be very new , which is the idea i would like to share with you today , that there is a set of rules and skills which can be learned and taught in order to perform successful nonviolent struggle .
well , the news here is that your skills [ that you ] bring in the conflict seem to be more important than the conditions , namely skills of unity , planning , and maintaining nonviolent discipline .
there are certain rules in nonviolent struggle you may follow .
and you know , we were just a small group of crazy students in serbia when we made this big skit .
this is how he became the public , and this is what probably became the straw which broke the camel 's back .
this is tiananmen square .
go back 200 years when the slave trade was under pressure from william wilberforce and all the protesters .
50 years ago the pressure was for the right to social security and welfare .
one of the things that has got to come out of copenhagen in the next few months is an agreement that there will be a global environmental institution that is able to deal with the problems of persuading the whole of the world to move along a climate-change agenda .
burma is in chains , zimbabwe is a human tragedy , in sudan thousands of people have died unnecessarily for wars that we could prevent .
they said , " let 's march . "
a man who turns towards me and smiles .
but she was frightened . she 'd lived 95 years and she 'd never had a hallucination before .
and she said , " tell all the nurses that i have charles bonnet syndrome . "
but sometimes he wasn 't sure whether he was hallucinating or not , because the hallucinations would fit in the context of the visions .
once , when she was driving , or rather , her husband was driving , the road divided into four and she felt herself going simultaneously up four roads .
something like 10 percent , as i said , of visually impaired people get these .
and one of the second commonest is cartoons .
i saw an aston martin this morning .
there must be hundreds of thousands of blind people who have these hallucinations , but are too scared to mention them .
and when i see all these hexagons and complex things , which i also have , in visual migraine , i wonder whether everyone sees things like this , and whether things like cave art or ornamental art may have been derived from them a bit .
why would you choose rats ?
well don 't talk rat , but we have a clicker , a standard method for animal training , which you see there .
we have a demonstration site in mozambique .
an animal only needs two hundredths of a second to discriminate the scent , so it goes extremely fast .
to conclude , there are also other applications at the horizon .
and some people would say that we 're born with it in some other means .
my father was a baptist minister , and he believed in miracles , and that god 's will would take care of that .
and i got a lot of them during what 's been going on throughout this conference , almost everything that 's been going on .
it was something i read in an editorial by a woman who was talking about the war in iraq . and she said , " save a man from drowning , you are responsible to him for life . "
i got these hints everywhere .
we come to this point and say , what do i as an individual do ?
these are the things i constantly think about from day to day .
and how are we going to assign what the responsibility and the causes are , outside of a court of law ?
it is in the hands of readers , and they interpret it differently .

i believe this starts with an evolution of existing methods .
you could scroll back through it , but interestingly , if you were watching it live , there was this suspense that built because the actual tweets , you had no control over when you would read them .
keep in mind , they 're all democrats .
i think borrowing all of these tropes from television and additionally presenting each crimer show as an episode , spelled e-p-p-a-s-o-d , " eppasod , " presenting them as episodes really , it creates something new .
i heard the word " carcinoma . "
i needed an anchor , an image , a peg to peg this process on , so that i could go from there .
durga , the fearless one .
and i 'm going to tell you a little bit about later on .
well , the question of origins , as with so many other questions in biology , seems to have been answered by darwin over a century ago .
digging things up out of the ground , and largely on the basis of morphology -- the way things are shaped , often skull shape -- saying , " this looks a little bit more like us than that , so this must be my ancestor .
it 's easy to dismiss this as the perhaps well-intentioned but ultimately benighted musings of an eighteenth century scientist working in the pre-darwinian era .
i suspect that not everybody in the audience is a geneticist .
mitochondrial dna , tracing a purely maternal line of descent .
it 's only within the last 60,000 years that we have started to generate this incredible diversity we see around the world .
the reason for that is that ice actually sucks moisture out of the atmosphere .
the population size started to expand .
and that 's the story that i told a couple of years ago in my book , " the journey of man , " and a film that we made with the same title .
that 's the focus of the field research , the centers that we 've set up all over the world -- 10 of them , top population geneticists .
so i 've been busy with a couple of projects , and one of them was this : the nutmeg .
in fact , i have got qualifications .
there was no starting point for peace .
and we started to build this case .
they used to say the pen is mightier than the sword . i think the camera is .
and working with ngos and building this case .
kofi annan invited me on the morning of september the 11th to do a press conference .
they can unite . they can come together . if people would stop , lives will be saved . "
i said , " i 'm going to go to afghanistan . " he said , " really ? "
and then we went home . we 'd sort of done it .
they were saying they would stop .
ultimately , that 's what it 's about . "
it 's all about the individuals .
coke is everywhere .
they have this very continuous feedback loop .
they set them up as what they called micro-distribution centers , and those local entrepreneurs then hire sales people , who go out with bicycles and pushcarts and wheelbarrows to sell the product .
how do you incent them based on the impact that they 're getting out in those remote villages ? "
so how does health and development market ?
one state in northern india has gone so far as to link toilets to courtship .
in 2009 , we 're down to 1,600 cases .
now one of the challenges in polio , still , is marketing , but it might not be what you think .
imagine if a team of physicists could stand inside of an atom and watch and hear electrons spin .
we 're now going to move from real biological data to biogenerative algorithms that create artificial nature in our next artistic and scientific installation .
you 're actually hearing and seeing the electron flow with the lines .
i 'm usually introduced as a polar explorer .
we eat and make money to be able to enjoy life .
one of the magical things about this journey , however , is that because i 'm walking over the sea , over this floating , drifting , shifting crust of ice that 's floating on top of the arctic ocean is it 's an environment that 's in a constant state of flux .
is there a chance you 'll see her there ? "
see , while museums all over the world have dodo skeletons in their collection , nobody -- not even the actual natural history museum on the island of mauritius -- has a skeleton that 's made from the bones of a single dodo .
i should point out at this time -- i 'm not a sculptor ; i 'm a hard-edged model maker .
you can see that i even made a museum label for it that includes a brief history of the dodo .
but i discovered , in researching further , really wanting precise reference , that one of the original lead birds had been sold at christie 's in 1994 , and so i contacted an antiquarian bookseller who had the original christie 's catalogue , and in it i found this magnificent picture , which included a size reference .
and i 'm following all the light kicks on this thing and making sure that as i 'm holding the light in the same position , i 'm getting the same type of reflection on it -- that 's the level of detail i 'm going into this thing .
here , i 'm going to put it out there , later on tonight , and i want you to pick it up and handle it .
thank you .
the great advantage of an external support for me was that i could retain all of my own bits , all of my own endothelium and valves , and not need any anticoagulation therapy .
john pepper , bless his heart , professor of cardiothoracic surgery -- never done it before in his life -- he put the first one in , didn 't like it , took it out , put the second one in .
well the answer to that is a multidisciplinary team .
so one needs to be careful with disciplinary conventions .
it must be rubbish . they binned it .
i think it 's not good , but there you are , that 's my view .
it would be a pleasure to speak with you . many thanks .
so i 've probably done about five years ' research looking at what people carry .
and in particular , it 's the mobile phone 's ability to allow people to transcend space and time .
ok , the next thing is -- most of you , if you have a stable home life , and what i mean is that you don 't travel all the time , and always in hotels , but most people have what we call a center of gravity .
simple question : if you can 't read and write , how do you manage your contact information ?
ok , there 's two things i like about this .
you can subscribe to these .
when those extra three billion people 's identity is mobile , it isn 't fixed ?
the next thing is that , however we design this stuff -- carefully design this stuff -- the street will take it , and will figure out ways to innovate , as long as it meets base needs -- the ability to transcend space and time , for example .
there was the bomb , and there 's now .
we didn 't know that pollution did more than cause bad visibility .
incredible , isn 't it ?
and with our hyper-consumption of those animals producing greenhouse gases and heart disease , kindness might just be a bit of a red herring .
eating ethnic was unheard of unless you were ethnic .
the south and west became agricultural hubs , and in other parts of the country , suburbs took over farmland .
and chicken soon joined them on the throne .
perhaps because it was being produced rationally , as if it were plastic , food gained magical or poisonous powers , or both .
and as evidence that things can actually change , you can now find organic food in supermarkets , and even in fast-food outlets .
and i say this as a man who has eaten a fair share of corned beef in his life .
less meat , less junk , more plants .
we 're working with the machine perception laboratory at the u.c. san diego .
this is one of our robots that we showed at wired nextfest a couple of years ago .
i 've been doing that for about 10 years .
went on , and eventually decided to devote myself , full time , to that .
so , one thing i found early on , when i started doing computer games , is that i could create puzzles that will alter your perception .
i like pushing on what an ambigram can mean .
and this follows the rules i just said : any black area that is surrounded by white can be picked up .
now , this one is a little bit trickier .
cut up the dna , you sequence individual pieces , and then you look for overlaps , and you basically match them at the edges . and i said , " this is kind of like a jigsaw puzzle , except the pieces overlap . "
so , we 're making smart games for social media .
and what does this add up to ?
looks like a black shape . so , where is that ?
robin and i , acting as collaborators , keep the landscape of the projects tilted towards completion .
this is a scottish castle where people are playing golf indoors , and the trick was to bang the golf ball off of suits of armor -- which you can 't see there .
and it carried 56 people at the speed of a buick at an altitude you could hear dogs bark , and it cost twice as much as a first-class cabin on the normandie to fly it .
they went five miles an hour and inside it was 105 degrees in the pitch dark .
i try to make life in new york look even weirder than it is with those covers .
people always ask me , where do you get your ideas , how do your ideas come ?
so let 's give this a try .
slide into the shimmering surface between two worlds . standing at the center of time as it uncurls . cutting through the veil of illusion . moving beyond past conclusions . wondering if all my doubt and confusion will clear . if i could be anywhere , if i could be anywhere , if i could be anywhere right now , i would want to be here . searching for the future among the things we 're throwing away . trying to see the world through the junk we produce everyday . they say nothing lasts forever , but all the plastic ever made is still here . and no amount of closing our eyes will make it disappear . if i could be anywhere , if i could be anywhere , if i could be anywhere in history , i would want to be here . the romans , the spanish the british , the dutch , american exceptionalism , so out of touch . the folly of empire repeating its course , imposing its will and ruling by force on and on through time . but the world can 't take it very much longer . we 're not going to make it unless we 're smarter and stronger . the world is going to shake itself free of our greed somehow . if i could be anywhere , if i could be anywhere in time , if i could be anywhere and change things , it would have to be now . they say nothing last forever , but all the plastic ever made is still here . and no amount of closing our eyes will make it disappear . and the world can 't take it very much longer . we 're not going to make it unless we 're smarter and stronger . the world 's gonna shake itself free of our greed somehow . and the world can 't take it , that you can see . if the oceans don 't make it , neither will we . the world 's gonna shake itself all the way free somehow . if i could be anywhere , if i could be anywhere in time , if i could be anywhere and change the outcome , it would have to be now . thank you .
environmental justice , for those of you who may not be familiar with the term , goes something like this : no community should be saddled with more environmental burdens and less environmental benefits than any other .
i watched nearly half of the buildings in my neighborhood burn down .
the common perception was that only pimps and pushers and prostitutes were from the south bronx .
and once this path is constructed , it 'll connect the south bronx with more than 400 acres of randall 's island park .
both are waterfront communities that host both industries and residents in close proximity of one another .
and although less than 25 percent of south bronx residents own cars , these projects include thousands of new parking spaces , yet zip in terms of mass public transit .
but as people began to see that they were being put first on issues reflecting their day-to-day lives , incredible things happened .
what troubled me was that this top-down approach is still around .
what if i could stick this molecule , slap it onto a bacteria that was pathogenic to me , that had just invaded my lungs ?
it doesn 't respond to antibiotics . so i don 't like it .
in the industrialized world , people were healthy , educated , rich , and they had small families .
so there they are .
will they move on ?
they get soap , hygiene , education , vaccination , penicillin and then family planning . family size is decreasing .
and look at the position of the old west .
history would know lothar meggendorfer as -- who else ? -- the world 's first true inventor of the children 's pop-up book .
he had a vision . when he got out , he was going to leave the dope game for good and fly straight , and he was actually working on merging his two passions into one vision .
and there 's very illegal hustles , which you smuggle in , you get smuggled in , drugs , pornography , cell phones , and just as in the outer world , there 's a risk-reward tradeoff , so the riskier the enterprise , the more profitable it can potentially be .
credit card , investment account ?
the answer comes from a behavioral science experiment that was run one hot summer , 10 years ago , and only 90 miles from here , in san marcos , california .
we deliver personalized home energy reports that show people how their consumption compares to their neighbors in similar-sized homes .
and we can harness this resource with no new material science simply by applying behavioral science .
now i 'm here with a genuine expert .
in fact , at the time , if you walked into a school for individuals with autism , you 'd hear a lot of noise , plenty of commotion , actions , people doing things , but they 're always doing things by themselves .
those are meanings that are acquired as part of their shared experiences with others .
but in fact the brain also becomes who we are , and at the same time that her behaviors are taking away from the realm of social interaction , this is what 's happening with her mind and this is what 's happening with her brain .
so i feel that we have a bio-ethical imperative .
well , we created those measures , and here , what you see is what we call a funnel of attention .
and what we see in the first six months of life is that those two groups can be segregated very easily .
we want that the next generations of individuals with autism will be able not only to express their strengths but to fulfill their promise .
i spent the last few years trying to answer that question , traveling around , meeting families , talking to scholars , experts ranging from elite peace negotiators to warren buffett 's bankers to the green berets .
so what is agile , and why can it help with something that seems so different , like families ?
sutherland said it was the best thanksgiving ever .
getting over our fear of riding bikes . making our beds .
i 've taken some ideas from the starrs and from many other families i met .
and the truth is , recent research backs him up .
enlist the children in their own upbringing .
the point is , we have to let our children succeed on their own terms , and yes , on occasion , fail on their own terms .
we don 't like dilemmas . we like solutions .
if you give children this happy narrative , you give them the tools to make themselves happier .
you just need to take small steps , accumulate small wins , keep reaching for that green stick .
will the bailout work ? we have national debt , detroit , currency valuations , healthcare , all these issues facing us .
but i read this fact the other day , that one trillion seconds equals 32 thousand years , so if you think about that , the context , the casualness with which we talk about trillion-dollar bailout here , and trillion there , we are stacking ourselves up for long-term leverage .
vasectomies are up 48 percent , according to the cornell institute .
we see high-end haggling in fashion today .
and lastly , some people are using hulu actually as a device to get rid of their cable bill .
complete transparency .
perfect example of that is patagonia .
and then they did a recent report i thought was fascinating .
it 's a moving truck through l.a. , and the only way you can find it is through twitter .
i think this is partially due to my father , who was blind .
so , he has four kids , right ?
so , three types of vision , right ?
actually , it was just me embracing my nature , which means that i didn 't actually fall that far from the tree after all .
so i wrote a book about this in ' 93 , but as i was finishing the book , i had to do a little bit of typesetting , and i was tired of going to my local copy shop to do it , so i bought a computer .
it 's a different shape , but other than that it 's the same basic limitation .
we 'll go by this a little quickly -- you get the idea .
i 've been simplifying things for 30 years .
received very favorably by business .
well , arthur c. clarke , a famous science fiction writer from the 1950s , said that , " we overestimate technology in the short term , and we underestimate it in the long term . "
computers became tools , and they got more tools that they could use and become more effective during that time .
but i think when it comes to factory robots , people are sort of afraid , because factory robots are dangerous to be around .
it 's got a little bit of basic common sense , goes and picks the objects .
they go to factories around the country .
demographics is really going to change our world .
thanks very much .
we have found a lot of evidence that dinosaurs changed from when they were juveniles to when they were adults .
then the dinosaurs , being social , act out their socialness , and they get together , and they conspire .
and the hell creek project was this massive undertaking to get as many dinosaurs as we could possibly find , and hopefully find some dinosaurs that had more material in them .
but she also found osteocytes , which are the cells that laid down the bones .
so we don 't have to make a dinosaur because we already have them .
we also have transgenesis .
we can save that one .
and the same goes for the tails .
it 's a demonstration of augmented reality .
it was jean robert-houdin , france 's greatest illusionist , who first recognized the role of the magician as a storyteller .
the same thing happens when people watch magic tricks .
and if the story is a good one , it might even make us smile .
now i was stupid , but not so stupid that i turned it down .
the dietrich book was an observation by her daughter ; it was a biography .
i miss michael .
hello !
all of these solutions derive their origins from the text of the book , but once the book designer has read the text , then he has to be an interpreter and a translator .
all those years , all those books , he never got tired of it .
so that 's my story . to be continued .
design -- i love its design .
at first i thought i was just going to be here to perform , but unexpectedly , i learned and enjoyed much more .
i knew i would find her someday , or we would find each other .
my son , i don 't know where he is .
and aicha started , and she said , " i don 't know if my son is guilty or innocent , but i want to tell you how sorry i am for what happened to your families .
i started a site called treehugger -- i care about this stuff .
it 's called weekday veg .
and something festered inside me after this happened .
and so we just heard about the dna sequencing .
and fortunately , in the course of this project , the transplant surgeons and the other people decided , forget common practice . we have to switch .
and it may be that probiotics can help prevent the development of this horrible necrotizing enterocolitis in these premature infants .
we even went to the international society of endocrinology meeting as family in quebec .
and a sea that 's just filled and teeming with jellyfish isn 't very good for all the other creatures that live in the oceans , that is , unless you eat jellyfish .
and lots of generations , lots of tweaking and torquing , and we turn our puffer into the mola .
and in the mediterranean , in the swordfish net fisheries , they make up up to 90 percent .
we 're tagging on the california coast , and we 're tagging over in taiwan and japan .
and over in these places , the molas are caught in set nets that line these countries .
they 're super industrious .
and sure , it may be just one big old silly fish , but it 's helping .
and i found one section amongst all of these that actually resembled the outline of the united states of america , which you can see here .
and in this i really wanted it to resemble an early still-life painting , so i spent some time with the smells and items .
and the air armament center at eglin air force base in florida is responsible for the deployment and testing of all air-delivered weaponry coming from the united states .
it 's called the world church of god .
i 'll give you an example from a case .
larry mayes , i photographed at the scene of arrest , where he hid between two mattresses in gary , indiana , in this very room to hide from the police .
that 's it . thank you .
we asked half of them to predict for us how much their values would change in the next 10 years , and the others to tell us how much their values had changed in the last 10 years .
no , it matters quite a bit , and i 'll give you an example of why .
the person you are right now is as transient , as fleeting and as temporary as all the people you 've ever been .
and these are some of the cells that might be overactive in disorders such as epilepsy .
but electricity also will go in all directions -- the path of least resistance , which is where that phrase , in part , comes from .
and each of these proteins acts just like that solar cell that i told you about .
not only can you use this to study what these cells do , what their power is in computing in the brain , but you can also use this to try to figure out -- well maybe we could jazz up the activity of these cells , if indeed they 're atrophied .
this goes back to the pavlovian days .
if you can delete cells just for a few milliseconds or seconds , you can figure out what necessary role they play in the circuits in which they 're embedded .
are the cells going to tolerate it ? will the immune system react ?
now mice are smart , so this mouse solves the maze eventually , but he does a brute-force search .
ed boyden : that 's right .
you can see the skydiver with the red suit , he 's in a stand-up position .
the special thing on these three jumps were , i hiked them all and climbed them all in only one day .
question one : so does that actually feel the way the flying dream does ?
because i just keep thinking of going that fast and having your whole face smushed backwards .
they still have old blackboards and whatnot .
and i let them go for about 10 seconds , then i go , " at ease ! "
" you didn 't shave . " " but sir — " " no , don 't tell me how often you scraped your face this morning .
and if the person doing it , whether it 's the mother or grandmother , whoever 's doing it , that is when the education process begins .
i was privileged to have that kind of good start .
yep .
i don 't know how many of you are new yorkers , but there were these tenement buildings , and these women were always hanging out one of the windows , leaning on a pillow .
we have to make sure they 're ready to be the leaders of this great country of ours , a country that is like no other , a country that amazes me every single day , a country that 's fractious . we 're always arguing with each other .
and the scene repeats itself so often .
people would yell at me from their passing cars .
in mansions where everyone in my crew gets their own room but there 's no wireless , and in punk squats , everyone on the floor in one room with no toilets but with wireless , clearly making it the better option .
it felt too much like begging to stand there with the hat .
and the goal was 100,000 dollars .
now let me tell you , if you want to experience the visceral feeling of trusting strangers , i recommend this , especially if those strangers are drunk german people .
we 've heard about these starting with the revelations from june 6 .
they can monitor foreigners when foreigners ' data connections end up in the united states or pass through the united states .
and we did not know that u.s. intelligence agencies go to extremes such as infiltrating standardization bodies to sabotage encryption algorithms on purpose .
so is one of the parties lying , or is there some other alternative explanation ?
i 'm speaking of sweden because sweden has a little bit of a similar law to the united states .
it 's not the war on terror .
it should be built in to all the systems we use .
we should be angry , because this is wrong , and it 's rude , and it should not be done .
so , act i : a map found .
those are two students at king 's college -- later columbia university -- sitting on a hill , overlooking a valley .
or the swamp at gramercy park , right here .
and we knew that they planted a kind of horticulture , that they grew these beautiful gardens of corn , beans , and squash , the " three sisters " garden .
as if these were the maps that we would need to predict where you would find the beaver .
and the structure of this is what makes nature work , seen with all its parts .
this is the view from the east river , looking up murray hill at where the united nations is today .
so , how can we envision the city of the future ?
and as you 'll see now , i 'm not wearing pants .
at the eighth stop , a girl came in with a giant duffel bag and announced she had pants for sale for a dollar -- like you might sell batteries or candy on the train .
looking at the entire facade -- there were 70 total windows -- and i knew what i had to do .
i think i 'll try to do that this weekend . thank you . "
so they started running around telling everybody the cops were coming , watch out , the cops were coming .
thank you .
and i think , as adults , we need to learn that there 's no right or wrong way to play .
so it 's time for change .
you can see it for yourself . there are colors , streetlights , new pavement with no potholes , trees . so it 's beautiful ; it 's safe . "
it 's about system , it 's about organization .
when people say all politicians are the same , ask yourself if obama was the same as bush , if françois hollande is the same as sarkozy .
clouds seldom visit this area .
it 's two houses .
and we request them .
but you can see that no woman is standing on those .
another water body , dried up , of course , during the summer period , but you can see how the traditional society combines engineering with aesthetics , with the heart .
and they have dubbed this water as the third one called [ unclear ] .
if the water table goes down , you will find new stairs .
the center of life is water .
can i ask you to please recall a time when you really loved something -- a movie , an album , a song or a book -- and you recommended it wholeheartedly to someone you also really liked , and you anticipated that reaction , you waited for it , and it came back , and the person hated it ?
they lack retention ; you find yourself re-explaining concepts three months later , wholesale .
when it comes time to do the actual problem set , we have problems like this right here where we 're just swapping out numbers and tweaking the context a little bit .
and then and only then , we throw down that mathematical structure .
how long will it take you to fill it up ? and that 's it .
so i 'm here to report some really fun games with students who come pre-installed with these viruses day one of the class .
thank you .
and even really respectable newspapers , some that i 'm actually subscribed to , the words they use are , you know , the state as this leviathan . right ?
gps was funded by the military 's navstar program .
and so this whole notion -- i mean , this is the point , right ?
darpa , that funded the internet and siri , actually thought really hard about this , how to welcome failure , because you will fail .
they even got the first -- well , not the first , but 500,000 dollars actually went to apple , the company , through this sbic program , which predated the sbir program , as well as , as i said before , all the technologies behind the iphone .
nasa , for example , serves thermal-stabilized sweet-and-sour pork on its shuttle menu for its astronauts .
so , how did they get to the united states ?
this is a billboard that says : " welcome to the birthplace of general tso . "
so , these people are going around china asking for chop suey , which is sort of like a japanese guy coming here and saying , i understand you have a very popular dish in your country called " leftovers , " and it is particularly -- -- right ?
lem sen , who 's this guy : i would have made this money , too , but i 've spent all this time looking for the american man who stole my recipe .
so , let 's take a step back , and kind of , understand what is to be appreciated in america .
you know , there are a bunch of them , including lee 's china in omaha -- which is actually run by koreans , but that 's another point -- and a bunch of them named china buffet .
so , the thing is , our historical lore , because of the way we like narratives , are full of vast characters such as , you know , howard schultz of starbucks and ray kroc with mcdonald 's and asa chandler with coca-cola .
stagehand : break a leg .
now , the interesting thing about that thesis -- if that thesis turns out to be true -- is that oil , and all hydrocarbons , turned out to be concentrated sunlight . and if you think of bioenergy , bioenergy isn 't ethanol . bioenergy is taking the sun , concentrating it in amoebas , concentrating it in plants , and maybe that 's why you get these rainbows .
what are the first principles of this stuff and where are we heading ? this is one of the gentle giants on the planet . he 's one of the nicest human beings you 've ever met . his name is hamilton smith . he won the nobel for figuring out how to cut genes -- something called restriction enzymes .
we are one species of about five and a half thousand mammalian species that exist on planet earth today .
and we can bring all this information into big gis packages , today .
fossil sites run up and down both lengths of that lake basin , which represents some 20,000 square miles .
unfortunately for him , he fell into a swamp and couldn 't get out .
we 're certainly a polluting , wasteful , aggressive species , with a few nice things thrown in , perhaps .
can we hold it together ?
the area near these walls , which nobody bothers to pay attention to , had been left free from major intervention , and this is where i first found my treasures .
and four : horn used to store energy in compression .
no , better yet , a part of my mind has just been shot over to your mind .
but people think that my job is to let the good words make that difficult left-hand turn into the dictionary , and keep the bad words out .
there 'd be virtually no learning curve .
right ? those little buttons , i had them all expanded except for the date chart .
why are you blaming the ham for being too big for the pan ?
we are studying the tolerances of the materials that you use to build the structure of your expression : your speeches and your writing . and then , often people say to me , " well , ok , how do i know that this word is real ? "
newspaper archive goes back to 1759 , 58.1 million newspaper pages . if only one in 100 of those pages had an un-dictionaried word on it , it would be an entire other oed .
we 're missing california from american english .
and the internet is great for collecting words , because the internet 's full of collectors .
we can put in all the meanings .
so something i think is very fascinating is what if you could give life to non-living structures , like batteries and like solar cells ?
before that , they were all soft , fluffy structures .
every year for the incoming freshman class at mit , i have a periodic table made that says , " welcome to mit . now you 're in your element . "
and this is pretty easy biotechnology .
you can make lots of amplifications to it .
thank you .
and i 'll just give you one example . i had gotten my first walkman .
and there was a little -- an interesting theory about abstraction .
met every wednesday at a subway stop with 20 of his friends .
but my last project is , again , from a young designer in new york .
and , just about at that time , an austrian magazine called and asked if we would want to do six spreads -- design six spreads that work like dividing pages between the different chapters in the magazine ?

and he wanted to go .
and after that first parabola , you know , the doc said everything is great . he was smiling , and we said go .
people have been debating the causes of happiness for a really long time , in fact for thousands of years , but it seems like many of those debates remain unresolved .
you 've probably heard people suggest that you should stay focused on the present . " be here now , " you 've probably heard a hundred times .
if mind-wandering were a slot machine , it would be like having the chance to lose 50 dollars , 20 dollars or one dollar . right ? you 'd never want to play .
thank you .
the traffic is so bad . the distance , and everything .
" i don 't need your help , " he said .
our average response time today went down to less than three minutes in israel .
muhammad asli and murad alyan .
i don 't think it existed , but i never imagined , i never imagined that it 's going to go all around , it 's going to spread around , and this last year we started in panama and brazil .
the world health organization estimates -- well , they make various estimates of the number of people who need glasses -- the lowest estimate is 150 million people .
okay , so i 've made these glasses and ...
how do you distribute ? how do you work out how to fit the thing ?
and so all of these proteins can get basically recycled and used all over again .
we 're also building an online database where anyone can view , download and contribute their own animations .
here in budrus , we realized the wall would steal our land .
there is no need to use violence .
they were going to be surrounded , lose a lot of their lands and not have freedom of access , either to the west bank or jerusalem .
and one of my biggest failures as a marketer in the last few years , a record label i started that had a cd called " sauce . "
you take the profit from that to buy more ads .
new products from coke japan -- water salad .
and " remarkable " is a really cool word because we think it just means neat , but it also means -- worth making a remark about .
every loaf baked in a bakery he owned , by one baker at a time , in a wood-fired oven .
to make a product , to market an idea , to come up with any problem you want to solve that doesn 't have a constituency with an otaku , is almost impossible .
this hospital crib cost 10,000 dollars , 10 times the standard .
and the people who come up with stuff that 's remarkable more often than not figure out how to put design to work for them .
people with 20,000-dollar stereos don 't like new music .
i lived in ireland , built the first straw-bale houses in ireland , and some cob buildings and all this kind of thing .
and that 's why , now , the new breakthroughs , the new frontiers in terms of oil extraction are scrambling about in alberta , or at the bottom of the oceans .
the people who make shoes go to sleep , wake up in the morning , and all the shoes are magically made for them .
energy and technology are not the same thing .
when they encounter shock from the outside that they don 't just unravel and fall to pieces .
but what do they actually do ? you know , it 's a kind of nice idea , but what do they actually do on the ground ?
from three years ago , it just being an idea , this has become something that has virally swept around the world .
and by loving and leaving all that oil has done for us , and that the oil age has done for us , we are able to then begin the creation of a world which is more resilient , more nourishing , and in which , we find ourselves fitter , more skilled and more connected to each other .
and frankie says , " i 'm number 22 in line , and i can see the needle coming down towards me , and there is blood all over the place .
so you 've got this massive mismatch ; everyone knows that if they share they 're going to get hiv , but they 're all sharing anyway .
now , places that didn 't do this -- new york city for example , moscow , jakarta -- we 're talking , at its peak , one in two injectors infected with this fatal disease .
here , maybe you 'll have better luck .
and , again , it 's because of an alignment of the incentives .
let 's just stop treating people . "
is that what 's happening ?
so , from the point of view of a sex worker , politicians are making no sense .
all that driving that we 've been doing out in the suburbs , we have doubled the amount of miles we drive .
we all tend to think of suburbia as this very family-focused place , but that 's really not the case anymore .
it 's now home to artist studios , theater groups , dance troupes .
and it 's just incrementally , over the last 20 years , built urbanism on top of its parking lots .
here was the mall in its heyday .
we need to also retrofit the corridors themselves .
so i 've shown you some of the first generation of retrofits .
they have urban streetscapes , but suburban parking ratios .
people are reluctant to talk about it -- there 's a fear associated with it .
so it 's the test a mother gets when she comes in .
a nurse in a busy clinic will see 50 to 100 patients in a day , which leaves her just minutes per patient -- minutes per patient .
all you 're hearing is , " i 'm going to die , and my baby is going to die . "
these mothers , we call them mentor mothers , are able to engage women who , just like themselves , pregnant with babies , have found out about being hiv-positive , who need support and education .
well , maybe the most important engagement is the one-to-one , seeing patients one-to-one , educating them , supporting them , explaining how they can take care of themselves .
and it 's important about disclosure .
mitchell besser : remember the images i showed you of how few doctors and nurses there are in africa .
we need to change attitudes to women in africa .
hiv-positive pregnant women must get pmtct services in order to have hiv-negative babies .
we 're talking about good , fresh food that is being wasted on a colossal scale .
in many ways , this is a great success story of human civilization , of the agricultural surpluses that we set out to achieve 12,000 years ago .
but this is what you can see more or less on every street corner in britain , in europe , in north america .
it 's called sheep 's organs .
in fact , humans answered that question 6,000 years ago : we domesticated pigs to turn food waste back into food .
if you come in you will see us : evening time , at table -- set for ten but not always all seats filled -- at the point when dinner is ready to be served .
let me explain a point at which we did not rise to the occasion .
now that 's compassion .
i know how you feel . "
in my tradition , there is a gift that we have made to other traditions -- to everybody around the world who knows the story of the " good samaritan . "
the reason it 's important is because this is a very special time in history .
these optimistic young bastards promise to honor and cherish each other through hot flashes and mid-life crises and a cumulative 50-lb. weight gain , until that far-off day when one of them is finally able to rest in peace .
obvious , right .
the data were based entirely on whether people looked happy in these early pictures .
that 's right -- when you have a close couple friend split up , it increases your chances of getting a divorce by 75 percent .
on the other hand , i have the fake happy picture thing .
you 'd plug it in , you 'd type in it and green text would come out .
remember when images were first possible with a computer , those gorgeous , full-color images ?
like , we gotta go to fear .
so -- yeah .
i 'll show this last one . this is about balance , you know .
and the shopkeeper would say , " it 's old . "
it 's a hierarchy . we all know that a hierarchy is how we run many systems today , but as we know , it 's been disrupted .
so what this is , is a kind of a sketch , an application sketch i wrote in python . you know how there 's photoshop ?
what i 'm about to say , at least some of what i 'm about to say , will cause controversy .
we are a country of victims .
daily life in our country is , to say the least , under extraordinary , exceptional circumstances .
we need to face our fears and take back our streets , our cities , our neighborhoods .
they sent a message to the kidnappers : " if you want your ransom come and get it .
that devotion we feel for the national football team .
they can take a man 's life .
is the french pronunciation correct ?
the arabic language doesn 't satisfy today 's needs .
that 's why they legislate to protect their language .
how do you say whether this guy understands or not ?
no problem !
and to whoever might say , " ha ! you used an english word ! "
it 's not easy to come back from such a place and rise .
so technically , i can actually read this .
so i get a basic idea as to what you might be about , what you might like , what you might do as a profession , etc . , etc .
and he said , " well , how are you going to hear this ? how are you going to hear that ? "
and every single entry had to be listened to , experienced and then based on the musical ability -- then that person could either enter or not .
so all of my performances are based on entirely what i experience , and not by learning a piece of music , putting on someone else 's interpretation of it , buying all the cds possible of that particular piece of music , and so on and so forth .
so when we do listen to each other , it 's unbelievably important for us to really test our listening skills , to really use our bodies as a resonating chamber , to stop the judgment .
however , not one of you got out of your seats to think , " right ! how can i clap ? ok , maybe ...
and so on and so forth . what does this piece require ?
they 're experiencing that rawness there .
now , for those of you who don 't know , a rube goldberg machine is a complicated contraption , an incredibly over-engineered piece of machinery that accomplishes a relatively simple task .
they wanted it to end precisely on time .
but as much as the small stuff stinks , we needed somewhere to start , so that we would have somewhere to go .
and the wonderful elation that we had when we finally completed it .
what do i know that would cause me , a reticent , midwestern scientist , to get myself arrested in front of the white house protesting ?
that earth would likely warm in the 1980 's , and warming would exceed the noise level of random weather by the end of the century .
soon the first line of the mission statement was deleted , never to appear again .
this imbalance , if we want to stabilize climate , means that we must reduce co2 from 391 ppm , parts per million , back to 350 ppm .
as earth warms , now because of extra co2 we put in the atmosphere , ice will melt , and co2 and methane will be released by warming ocean and melting permafrost .
fifty years ago , such anomalies covered only two- to three-tenths of one percent of the land area .
a large fraction of species will be committed to extinction .
they 're even more shocked by what he says .
richard jones became an important economist who later influenced karl marx .
whewell 's worldwide study of the tides resulted in public tide tables and tidal maps that freely provided the harbormasters ' knowledge to all ship captains .
and for the first time , they gave women a foot in the door of science .
thank you .
in what i call the flushed-and-plumbed world that most of us in this room are lucky to live in , the most common symptoms associated with those diseases , diarrhea , is now a bit of a joke .
it 's a wonderful waste disposal device .
it 's got nutrients in it .
so the really interesting , exciting work -- this is the engaging bit -- in sanitation is that we need to understand human psychology .
and if you know anything about rural india , you 'll know that 's an unspeakably courageous thing to do .
but most importantly , what they have done in japan , which i find so inspirational , is they 've brought the toilet out from behind the locked door .
anyway , i did this house in santa monica , and it got a lot of notoriety .
i couldn 't deal with the success of furniture -- i wasn 't secure enough as an architect -- and so i closed it all up and made furniture that nobody would like .
three weeks later , i received a complete set of drawings saying we 'd won the competition .
and it 's one of the nicest pieces i 've ever made , i think .
he was a souvenir salesman who always wanted to be a painter , and i was frankie p. toronto .
of course , the milk can is his .
the metalworkers , for the most part , do ducts behind the ceilings and stuff .
because these were ideas that we were talking about , building things next to each other , making -- it 's all about [ a ] metaphor for a city , maybe .
and it surprised both boston and myself that we got it approved , because they have very strict kind of design guideline , and they wouldn 't normally think i would fit them .
when you have to do something really cheaply , it 's hard to get perfect corners and stuff .
in this case we learned how to detail it .
i feel much more comfortable down here .
left -- it 's my right .
you go under this bridge at about 65 miles an hour , and there 's another bridge here .
i showed you the other model , the one -- this is the way i organized myself so i could make the drawing -- so i understood the problem .
i say , " i 'm not going to do it anymore -- i don 't want to do it anymore -- i 'm not going to do it . "
and as you pass by it 's always part -- you see it as all of these pieces accrue and become part of an overall neighborhood .
but finally , there 's a hotel there .
most halls come straight down into a proscenium .
we showed this to the hotel people the other day , and they were terrified and said that nobody would come to the ritz-carlton anymore , because of this fish .
we have about a quarter of a million in transit to those and other children , and then there are another quarter of a million more that are being ordered at this moment .
and the reason she brought her mother is that this six-year-old child had been teaching her mother how to read and write .
you vaccinate all the children in an area .
he lost no worse than most people do .
you kind of see the relationship between the redder states of where more people responded and said , " yes , barack obama 's race was a problem for me . "
this is conducted by the university of chicago every other year .
you see people without neighbors who are african-american who were much more likely to say , " that would give me a problem . "
i think part of the education variable we talked about before is the networking experience you get when you go to college where you do get a mix of people that you might not interact with otherwise .
taste for both natural beauty and for the arts travel across cultures with great ease .
the peacock 's magnificent tail is the most famous example of this .
the ideal savanna landscape is one of the clearest examples where human beings everywhere find beauty in similar visual experience .
so what were these ancient -- i mean , they 're ancient , they 're foreign , but they 're at the same time somehow familiar .
no , it 's deep in our minds .
okay , so we have a democracy , no doubt , but it 's dependent upon the lesters and dependent upon the people .
candidates for congress and members of congress spend between 30 and 70 percent of their time raising money to get back to congress or to get their party back into power , and the question we need to ask is , what does it do to them , these humans , as they spend their time behind the telephone , calling people they 've never met , but calling the tiniest slice of the one percent ?
it 's a corruption relative to the framers ' baseline for this republic .
block reform .
yours is the most important issue , but mine is the first issue , the issue we have to solve before we get to fix the issues you care about .
it takes generations to tear that intuition , that dna , out of the soul of a people .
of course not . i would do everything i could , and i would do everything i could because this is what love means , that the odds are irrelevant and that you do whatever the hell you can , the odds be damned .
and let me just run through a few slides .
the stars in those galaxies probably don 't have planets around them .
one idea , incidentally -- and i had this hazard sign to say i 'm going to speculate from now on -- is that our big bang was not the only one .
and more than that , it 's engendering new kinds of change .
and also , when a scientist makes a discovery , he or she normally has no clue what the applications are going to be .
the unfolding of intelligence and complexity still has immensely far to go , here on earth and probably far beyond .
then other things happened even more abruptly .
so that 's just the eye of the bee with a microscope , and now all of a sudden you can see that the bee has thousands of individual eyes called ommatidia , and they actually have sensory hairs in their eyes so they know when they 're right up close to something , because they can 't see in stereo .
but i want to talk about this larger world , the world of the micro world .
an amazing array of incredible things exist in sand .
this is some micrometeorites that the army gave me , and they get these out of the drinking wells in the south pole .
so what i 've been trying to tell you today is things even as ordinary as a grain of sand can be truly extraordinary if you look closely and if you look from a different and a new point of view .
which means that really is what you would see if you took a dive in a submersible .
that chin barbel is flashing .
in fact , it 's thought that some of these are as much as 3,000 years old , which is one reason that bottom trawling should not be allowed .
it 's a green saber of light .
it looks like a little of string pearls basically -- in fact , three strings of pearls .
this is at 3,000 feet in monterey canyon .
thank you .
i just look at the information , and knowledge , and experience that is lost due to natural causes of death in general , and aging , in particular .
another author doesn 't give any numerical estimate , but says the probability is significant that it will fail .
every once in a while we have these moments , and we realize just how good life can be when it 's at its best .
and this is the answer -- we would have to change .
it 's possible to assume , setting aside a possibility of catastrophe , that sooner or later we will develop all of these .
so we could think of adding on different , new sensory capacities and mental faculties .
then you could live sorts of lives and accumulate wisdoms that are just not possible for humans as we currently are .
and she said to them , " vusi 's here , and you 're not going to take him tonight .
this is one in my neighborhood . and they are much better -- better than traffic lights , better than four-way stop signs .
i mean , why is there that stop sign in each direction ?
don 't wait for that sign to be adopted , these things don 't change quickly .
if you were in a hospital , he said , it was going to do you good only because it offered you some warmth , some food , shelter , and maybe the caring attention of a nurse .
but we can make it possible for most .
there 's another sign that we need pit crews , and that 's the unmanageable cost of our care .
a very expensive pile of junk that does not go anywhere .
the volume of surgery had spread around the world , but the safety of surgery had not .
and we had a mix of dumb stuff on there -- making sure an antibiotic is given in the right time frame because that cuts the infection rate by half -- and then interesting stuff , because you can 't make a recipe for something as complicated as surgery .
and it seemed like time that we become that way ourselves .
if your bank account 's one dollar , and you flip a single bit , you could end up with a thousand dollars .
and if i haven 't revealed my prejudices already , i think that life has been about molecular computers building electrochemical computers , building electronic computers , which together with electrochemical computers will build new molecular computers , which will build new electronic computers , and so forth .
so , this is normal dna , what you think of as normal dna .
the net action of many of these on that long strand is to fold it into something like a rectangle .
when you zoom in , they 've got , you know , weak jaws that flip over their heads and some of their noses get punched out , but it 's pretty good .
the dna origami is a proof that that compiler actually works .
and in order to get these kinds of computations started right , you need some kind of input , a kind of seed .
that 's really not affordable .
and the computations that it uses , they 're molecular computations , and in order to understand this and get a better handle on it , as feynman said , you know , we need to build something to understand it .
but , then he came back , and things happened , and i decided i really hated my writing , that it was awful , awful , purple prose .
but i have been taking beautiful notes of drawings and i have a gorgeous onion from murray gell-mann 's talk .
but anyway , so we were in venice , and this is our room . and i had this dream that i was wearing this fantastic green gown , and i was looking out the window , and it was really a beautiful thing .
but i picked it up and i started reading it and i thought , this book is amazing .
so , once a month for the last year , i 've been doing a column called " the principles of uncertainty , " which , you know , i don 't know who heisenberg is , but i know i can throw that around now . you know , it 's the principles of uncertainty , so , you know .
which i think i made up , which is a good thing .
" and this woman leans over in anguish , not about that man , but about all sad things . it happens quite often in february . "
so -- and that 's a song about how everybody 's miserable because , you know , we 're from russia .
and it says , " ich habe genug , " which is a bach cantata , which i once thought meant " i 've had it , i can 't take it anymore , give me a break , " but i was wrong .
might be answered by studying these systems .
well , how do we do this ?
depending on how strong it is , maybe structure forms faster or slower .
it 's a caviar vending machine .
first of all , this looked a lot like my facebook wall .
thank you .
i used to deal with intelligence agencies , and i 'd complain that they weren 't sharing enough intelligence , and with a straight face , they 'd look at me and they 'd say , " what aren 't you getting ? "
it was the idea that we were now part of a team in which information became the essential link between us , not a block between us .
we didn 't all know each other , but we all kind of trusted each other , and that basic feeling of trust permeated the whole network , and there was a real sense that we could depend on each other to do things .
they didn 't intend to screw up asia , but they did because of the way that the protocols work .
but the fact is , people are mostly focused on defending the computers on the internet , and there 's been surprisingly little attention to defending the internet itself as a communications medium .
it 's turning into one of these big emergent systems like the financial system , where we 've designed all the parts but nobody really exactly understands how it operates and all the little details of it and what kinds of emergent behaviors it can have .
and so i think that this is actually , of all the problems you 're going to hear about at the conference , this is probably one of the very easiest to fix .
paid line standing .
some economists have proposed a market solution : offer cash incentives to kids for getting good grades or high test scores or for reading books .
what is , or should be , the intrinsic motivation ?
now , what this , even this brief debate , brings out is something that many economists overlook .
democracy does not require perfect equality , but what it does require is that citizens share in a common life .
here we have diogenes with his lantern .
you just didn 't want to respond to that person that time .
in north america , we call this astroturfing , and astroturfing is very common now . there 's a lot of concerns about it .
my friends , no way they can be that cool and have good of a life .
one of the reasons is pretty simple . if you go to a date , a coffee date , and you 're completely different than what you said , game over . right ? so people lied frequently , but they lied subtly , not too much . they were constrained .
a lot of humans have lived since then .
but i want everybody to raise their hand at some point .
we believe that every lie now , every type of lie -- fake hotel reviews , fake shoe reviews , your girlfriend cheating on you with text messaging -- those are all different lies . they 're going to have different patterns of language . but because everything 's recorded now , we can look at all of those kinds of lies .
many countries that you represent and where i come from struggle with the cost of healthcare .
the differences were dramatic .
" oh , we should measure this . " " no , we should measure that . "
now , you can imagine how much savings there would be for society .
so it is , by measuring and creating transparency , you get a cycle of continuous improvement , which is what this slide shows .
we discussed , how do we treat these kids , what are important improvements ?
the science budget is actually -- if you look to your left , there 's a purple set of blobs and then yellow set of blobs .
this is how we visualize that in " wonders of the solar system . "
we think it 's saltwater , and that would mean that there 's more water on that moon of jupiter than there is in all the oceans of the earth combined .
what about scientific discovery ?
the way that silicon behaves , the fact that you can build transistors , is a purely quantum phenomenon .
it 's called a carbon-oxygen dwarf .
but it 's a famous picture , not because of the beauty and majesty of saturn 's rings , but actually because of a tiny , faint blob just hanging underneath one of the rings .
the aggregates of joy and suffering thousands of confident religions , ideologies and economic doctrines , every hunter and forager , every hero and coward , every creator and destroyer of civilization , every king and peasant , every young couple in love , every mother and father , hopeful child , inventor and explorer , every teacher of morals , every corrupt politician , every superstar , every supreme leader , every saint and sinner in the history of our species , lived there , on a mote of dust , suspended in a sunbeam .
the algae that grow are in a container that distributes the heat to the surrounding water , and you can harvest them and make biofuels and cosmetics and fertilizer and animal feed , and of course you 'd have to make a large area of this , so you 'd have to worry about other stakeholders like fishermen and ships and such things , but hey , we 're talking about biofuels , and we know the importance of potentially getting an alternative liquid fuel .
it 's modular . let 's say something happens that 's totally unexpected to one of the modules .
the algae are not going to suffocate because of co2 , as we would .
so we would have under this system a shellfish aquaculture where we 're growing mussels or scallops .
sustainable solutions for our future problems are going to be diverse and are going to be many .
and i was initially resistant , because i always think poetry can stand alone by itself .
it wants only to be here tomorrow , dressed perhaps in the sleeve of a plaid shirt , nose pressed against the page , writing a few more dutiful lines while i gaze out the window and imagine budapest or some other city where i have never been .
and the poem begins with a certain species of forgetfulness that someone called literary amnesia , in other words , forgetting the things that you have read .
i wondered about you when you told me never to leave a box of wooden strike-anywhere matches just lying around the house , because the mice might get into them and start a fire .
and schlepping is an ancient and honorable art .
i want to ask you all to consider for a second the very simple fact that , by far , most of what we know about the universe comes to us from light .
and yet black holes may be heard even if they 're not seen , and that 's because they bang on space-time like a drum .
and he took schwarzschild 's idea to the prussian academy of sciences the next week .
if this were battlestar galactica and you 're fighting the cylons , don 't hide behind the black hole .
this computer simulation is due to a relativity group at nasa goddard .
at home it sounds kind of anticlimactic .
and lisa will be able to see super-massive black holes -- black holes millions or billions of times the mass of the sun .
that song has been ringing through space for all that time .
so we have to wonder , if there is a multiverse , in some other patch of that multiverse , are there creatures ?
there isn 't . i 'll tell you what .
next your non-essential systems start to shut down , like digestion .
all i had to do was write a song that exploits my nervousness .
let me tell you about that , but let me start with comfort .
all these parameters go into the comfort feeling of our human body , and scientists have developed a parameter , which is the perceived temperature , where all these parameters go in and help designers to understand which is the driving parameter that i feel comfort or that i don 't feel comfort .
we applied the same concept : shading of the training pitch , using a shelter against wind , then using the grass .
and i also hope that you share the idea that if engineers and designers can use all these different climatic parameters , it will be possible to create really good and comfortable outdoor conditions , to change our thermal perception that we feel comfortable in an outdoor environment , and we can do that with the best passive design , but also using the energy source of the site in qatar which is the sun .
i certainly would like to know what happened to the person who had that insight back then , if they actually followed it to its ultimate conclusion .
and i put some effort in to try and check to see how well these simple portrayals of trends over time actually matched up with some ideas and investigations from the side , and i found that they matched up very well .
so they had created these artifacts .
if i want to make a little script to do this over and over again , i just drag these guys out and set them going .
so how do the children do science ?
and they say , " oh , yeah . constant acceleration .
thank you .
now , what i mean by echolocation -- they emit a sound from their larynx out through their mouth or through their nose . this sound wave comes out and it reflects and echoes back off objects in their environment , and the bats then hear these echoes and they turn this information into an acoustic image .
they are the perpetrators in horror movies , such as this famous " nightwing . "
and for one year in the u.s. alone , it 's estimated that it 's going to cost 22 billion u.s. dollars , if we remove bats . so indeed , bats then do bring us wealth .
if we look at that region in mammals that don 't see so well , such as bats , and we find that bats that don 't see so well have the purple type , we know that this is probably what 's causing this disease .
how about 40 ? okay , it 's a whole varied response .
so ...

can geographic information make you healthy ?
this is my life . these are my life places .
okay , i spent 25 years , in my middle-age lungs now , breathing various concentrations of that .
how many people in the room have spent the majority of their life in the white space ?
this might be what we end up with .
so , i 'd very much like to see us begin to really seize this as an opportunity to get this into our medical records .
and those questions all have variables to them .
there are so many other people sharing their stories .
anyone want to run a comparative effectiveness study on prayer against something ? let 's look at prayer .
you scroll down in this profile and you can see all of his prescription drugs , but more than that , in the new version , i can look at this interactively .
you 're trying to manage these , and this grid is available here , and we want to understand it .
so , you know we said -- we looked at this , and what i love also is that people always accuse these internet sites of promoting bad medicine and having people do things irresponsibly .
can we find out what 's going to happen to you , so that you can maybe change it ? "
and the ones in the middle are all of our patients from the start of lithium at time zero , going forward , and then going backward .
we hired them , set them up , assisting at lab .

alongside that is " don 't think twice , it 's all right . "
2007 . the iphone makes it debut .
now , can someone own this idea ?
1983 . bob dylan is 42 years old , and his time in the cultural spotlight is long since past .
a few years ago , kevin kelly , my partner , and i noticed that people were subjecting themselves to regimes of quantitative measurement and self-tracking that went far beyond the ordinary , familiar habits such as stepping on a scale every day .
and this is the sleep tracking system of today .
i was lost .
so when i found a cheap camera on the subway , i started documenting those adventures with my friends and gave them back as photocopies -- really small photos just that size .
i know those guys .
asked them to make a face as a sign of commitment .
we 're pasting portraits -- so both portraits in the streets in a crowded market .
when you go in these developing societies , women are the pillars of their community , but the men are still the ones holding the streets .
we 're hungry for culture .
everyone there understood the project .
some who understood the project would explain it to others .
okay , india .
hopefully , you 'll see the film , and you 'll understand the scope of the project and what the people felt when they saw those photos .
but yesterday the city called them and said , " look , you 're going to have to tear it down .
art is not supposed to change the world , to change practical things , but to change perceptions .
and this starts right now and depends on you .
and the bacteria are feeding on the sugar nutrients in the liquid .
using fruit and vegetable staining , create organic patterning .
finally , at the end of use , we could biodegrade it naturally along with your vegetable peelings .
it 's not my idea , other people have hit on it , but i 've tried to take it to some new places .
and i realized then , i wasn 't either .
and i would submit that this idea does this .
just to give you grounds for comparison , rice : 35,000 genes .
what else does he have ?
he can graze again , he can cut , he can bring in another species , like the lambs , or he can make hay for the winter .
it 's a remarkably hopeful thing to do .
it 's not inevitable , but we need to act decisively .
then they care about big issues like climate change .
you 'll change your smartphone seven or eight times , probably more if you 're in this audience .
farmers are coming out of poverty . they love it .
we know we 'll use electricity in 20 or 30 years ' time .
you 've got to say that 's not enough today .
vote with your wallets .
now , this isn 't new . anyone who 's used google earth has seen this before , but one thing we like to say in our group is , we do the opposite of google earth .
granted , we 're not sending humans up at the moment , well at least with our own launch vehicles , but nasa is far from dead , and one of the reasons why we write a program like this is so that people realize that there 's so many other things that we 're doing .
i 'm going to pull out , and i want to show you voyager 1 as it flies by saturn .
we live in in a remarkable time , the age of genomics .
right . all together now .
and in fact , we don 't know if this hypothesis is correct , because we have never had technologies powerful enough to test it .
let 's zoom in on one synapse , and keep your eyes on the interior of the green neuron .
one neuron can be connected to so many other neurons , because there can be synapses at these points of contact .
someday , a fleet of microscopes will capture every neuron and every synapse in a vast database of images .
and if you put those two facts together , it means that your experiences can change your connectome .
how will we go about testing the hypothesis " i am my connectome ? "
and if you appreciate that number , you can easily see there is huge potential for mis-wiring of the brain .
connectomes will mark a turning point in human history .
imagine you are in a maternity ward in mali , and have a newborn in need of urgent medication .
compare this with trying to trespass a bad road in the developing world , or even being stuck in traffic in a developed world country .
the next big question is , what 's the cost ?
china alone is adding a megacity the size of new york city every two years .
because of some of technologies we 've been talking about .
after 25 years of working on issues of poverty and innovation , it 's true that there are probably no more market-oriented individuals on the planet than low-income people .
it was a way of bringing small amounts of water directly to the stalk of the plant .
and though that company has just started , our assumption is that there too we 'll see the impact on millions .
we 've had a rocky relationship with that country and , in all fairness , the united states has not always been a very reliable partner .
his name was raja , and he had kind , twinkly hazel eyes and warm expressive hands that reminded me of my father .
but i know that many other kinds of innovation also work .
and so the next -- over the next six decades , believe it or not , i 've built a number of aircraft , with the goal of creating something that could do for you , or me , what the hummingbird does , and give you that flexibility .
what we really need is something to replace the automobile for those 50-plus mile trips .
so , i 'm not going to quote myself on this .
or it 's going to have no use to you as a person who might use such a system .
getting that energy is very , very difficult . it all comes down to that power plant -- how to get a large amount of power in a small package .
i 'd like to show you an animation in this next one , which is one element of the skycar 's use , but it 's one that demonstrates how it could be used .
so , last month , the encyclopaedia britannica announced that it is going out of print after 244 years , which made me nostalgic , because i remember playing a game with the colossal encyclopedia set in my hometown library back when i was a kid , maybe 12 years old .
nowadays there are hundreds of links to choose from .
statistically , one of you is a beetle .
so when i click on " sympathetic magic , " i get sympathetic magic and voodoo dolls .
he 's born in cameroon , which is smack in the middle of my tropics map , and more specifically his skeleton wound up in the smithsonian museum getting picked clean by beetles .
what this means is that if you could shrink the earth to the size of a billiard ball , if you could take planet earth , with all its mountain tops and caves and rainforests , astronauts and uncontacted tribes and chimpanzees , voodoo dolls , fireflies , chocolate , sea creatures making love in the deep blue sea , you just shrink that to the size of a billiard ball , it would be as smooth as a billiard ball , presumably a billiard ball with a slight bulge around the middle .
my own mother — and i should say this here — she same to this country in the late ' 60s , and she was , you know , she found herself pregnant , as women did in the late ' 60s . you know what i mean ?
it was a summer of love if you were white .
i was starting to stay out a little bit late , etc . , etc .
by the way , years later , my social worker said that i should never have been put in there .
in the imagination i saw the endless possibility of life , the endless truth , the permanent creation of reality , the place where anger was an expression in the search for love , a place where dysfunction is a true reaction to untruth .
and it will be some months beforeward , and we see a long steady progression of the evolution from the first wiggles , to rolling over , and sitting up , and crawling , standing , walking , before we get to that magical point in which we can motate in the world .
every one of us has a different set of acquired skills and abilities that all derive out of the plasticity , the adaptability of this really remarkable adaptive machine .
and when i do that i actually specialize the brain to be a master processor for that meaningless sound .
it was actually conducted about five years ago in collaboration with scientists from the university of provence in marseilles .
if we look at the selectivity of responses in the cortex of the monkey , we see that the monkey has actually changed the filter characteristics which represents input from the skin of the fingertips that are engaged .
what it 's all about is the selective representations of things that are important to the brain .
and i 'm going to talk about experiments that involve actually using this brain science , first of all to understand how it contributes to the loss of function as we age .
it 's degraded .
and they are going to have poor reading skills .
think of the children on the slow side of the class .
my issues are to try to get to rescuing older citizens more completely and in larger numbers , because i think this can be done in this arena on a vast scale -- and the same for kids .
it 's sustainable ; it 's a sustainable material that is processed all in water and at room temperature -- and is biodegradable with a clock , so you can watch it dissolve instantaneously in a glass of water or have it stable for years .
and we take advantage of something that is very simple .
and then you go a little crazy , and so you do various optical components or you do microprism arrays , like the reflective tape that you have on your running shoes .
but there are still some unique traits .
so we 've made a silk card with penicillin in it .
no matter what i tried , the weight i 'd lost always came back .
that 's a lot of food .
several long-term studies have shown that girls who diet in their early teenage years are three times more likely to become overweight five years later , even if they started at a normal weight , and all of these studies found that the same factors that predicted weight gain also predicted the development of eating disorders .
and my answer , in a word , is mindfulness .
even at its best , dieting is a waste of time and energy .
yet we dither , taking no action to deflect the asteroid , even though the longer we wait , the more difficult and expensive it becomes . "
can 't you see reality ? if you won 't help , then get the hell out of the way . "
this is an image of muslims circling the kaaba in mecca .
they could rearrange themselves , form bipartisan committees , but as the moral electromagnet got cranked up , the force field increased , democrats and republicans were pulled apart .
the moral electromagnet is turning back on , and nowadays , just very recently , democrats really dislike republicans .
for example , this " citizens united " ruling is a disaster , because it means there 's like a money gun aimed at your head , and if you step out of line , if you try to reach across the aisle , there 's a ton of money waiting to be given to your opponent to make everybody think that you are a terrible person through negative advertising .
so here 's another asteroid .
i 'm actually more critical of the men who won 't take responsibility for their own children and of an economic system that makes it difficult for many men to earn enough money to support those children .
common ground is often very hard to find .
and as a chemist , one of the things i wanted to ask my research group a couple of years ago is , could we make a really cool universal chemistry set ?
you put it in your search engine , and you create the drug to treat the threat .
and what it turned out was going on was that facebook was looking at which links i clicked on , and it was noticing that , actually , i was clicking more on my liberal friends ' links than on my conservative friends ' links .
this is something that 's sweeping the web .
it gives us some information vegetables ; it gives us some information dessert .
we need you to make sure that they 're transparent enough that we can see what the rules are that determine what gets through our filters .
and this immediately cheers him up , as his courage is stimulated to rise to the occasion .
so he said , " okay , i get the point . "
and he sees the maggots , and the maggots are kind of looking a little cute .
so as he comes up from his first bow he says , " my lord , i 'm so happy to see you , but where have you been for 12 years ?
and it begins first by one meditating and visualizing that all beings are with one -- even animals too , but everyone is in human form .
so , in that sense , we 're related .
and you do that for a while , until you really feel that .
but , actually , that 's practical .
and this is where you feel real compassion for them .
compassion makes you happy .
so we know how to do this in many of the ways that are up there .
why is this important ?
one thing you can do is not treat . you can ration health care .
there are 370 soldiers that have come back from iraq that have lost limbs .
secondly , we can use materials .
and this lady decided , after a year of attempted treatment of that ulcer , that she would try this new therapy that steve invented .
there are materials that do this . here are the heart patches .
this was a randomized trial .
here 's just one example before i close up .
a number of governments , and a number of regions , have recognized that this is a new way to treat disease .
i have the answer to a question that we 've all asked .
now in arabic , we can make this definite by adding the definite article " al . "
and of course , it 's your stuff if it 's broken .
most of what 's extracted from our end-of-life stuff , if it makes it to a recycler , are the metals .
they extract what they can , which is mostly the metals -- circuit boards and so forth -- and they leave behind mostly what they can 't recover , which is , again , mostly the plastics .
it 's the last major material to be recovered in any significant amount on the earth .
they recover the metals and leave behind what 's called shredder residue -- it 's their waste -- a very complex mixture of materials , but predominantly plastics .
so i hope i 've changed the way you look at at least some of the stuff in your life .
for example , a trillion dollars of real estate remains uncapitalized in india alone .
in fact , understanding why cooking works requires knowing the science of cooking -- some of the chemistry , some of the physics and so forth .
but the other thing is that maybe we could seduce people into stuff that was a little more technical , maybe a little bit more scientific , maybe a little bit more chef-y than they otherwise would have .
because our hamburger recipe , our ultimate hamburger recipe , if you make the buns and you marinate the meat and you do all this stuff , it does take about 30 hours .
the great thing is , when you cut something in half , you have another half .
it 's a little couple paragraphs to explain why we call that unit of heat the watt , and where he got his inspiration .
we make every aspect of this burger .
and they 're nice big pages too .
that , much as the gravitational pull of the earth slows the ascent of an apple tossed upward , the gravitational pull of each galaxy on every other must be slowing the expansion of space .
expressed in the relevant unit , it is spectacularly small .
but string theory says that , on fantastically small scales , there are additional dimensions crumpled to a tiny size so small that we have not detected them .
which means that the mystery of explaining the amount of dark energy we 've now measured would take on a wholly different character .
and again , that 's a question we can answer .
the extra dimensions take on a wide variety of different shapes .
i suspect the latter .
maybe some of these conversations can continue .
and a tough , slouchy kid got up to bat , and he took a swing and really connected .
they 're locations in the spectrum of sound .
and there began to be a real difference at this point between the art of improvisation and the art of composition .
and the basic chords were the ones we still have with us , the triads , either the major one , which we think is happy , or the minor one , which we perceive as sad .
what happens when the music stops ?
well let me show you a story of what i mean by " really sticking with us . "
you can start anywhere . ramble a bit .
i do not stand here today to suggest in any way that conducting hiv clinical trials in developing countries is bad .
the information in these trials needs to be given to the potential participants in linguistically and culturally acceptable formats .
i was able to get her enrolled into a free hiv treatment program closer to her home , and with a support group to help her cope .
most old people in the u.s. end up living separately from their children and from most of their friends of their earlier years , and often they live in separate retirements homes for the elderly , whereas in traditional societies , older people instead live out their lives among their children , their other relatives , and their lifelong friends .
still another traditional value of older people is in making tools , weapons , baskets , pots and textiles .
just think , what 's the last time you saw a coke or beer ad depicting smiling people 85 years old ? never .
my family 's first tv set in 1948 had only three knobs that i quickly mastered : an on-off switch , a volume knob , and a channel selector knob .
a challenge for society is to make use of those things that older people are better at doing .
those are just some examples of what we can learn from traditional societies .
if you 're cremated , all those toxins i mentioned are released into the atmosphere .
we want to eat , not be eaten by , our food .
and the saying goes , we came from dust and will return to dust .
and at last , we appear to be doing something about it .
so when we are confronted by a powerful image , we all have a choice : we can look away , or we can address the image .
so , indeed , i have spent my life looking into the lives of presidents who are no longer alive .
but there were so many losses in his early life that he was haunted by death .
" everyone is broken by life , " ernest hemingway once said , " but some people are stronger in the broken places . "
but as he was about to put his signature on the proclamation his own hand was numb and shaking because he had shaken a thousand hands that morning at a new year 's reception .
the lyndon johnson that i saw in the last years of his life , when i helped him on his memoirs , was a man who had spent so many years in the pursuit of work , power and individual success , that he had absolutely no psychic or emotional resources left to get him through the days once the presidency was gone .
but i also worried that part of it was that i was then a young woman .
in those last years , he said he was so sad watching the american people look toward a new president and forgetting him .
" oh , yes , " he said , " perfectly appropriate place for him . "
so i went to my father in tears , " what are we going to do ? "
but luckily , my first confession -- to a baseball-loving priest !
and she 's a very high-tech superintendent .
so i got a degree and it turned out to be education .
he proposed the film to me -- it 's a great title .
and miss banks was there as a great mentor for me .
i 'll make something -- i didn 't say interactive ; we didn 't have that term in 1978 -- but something interactive .
if al gore is here , i 'm going to send my fourth-graders from agnor-hurt and venable schools to you because they solved global warming in a week .
and because i don 't know , they 've got to dig up the answer .
this is the world peace game . what is wrong with you ? "
so you have a little bit more thought before you commit to combat .
and i think it 's sort of weird to be living what sun tzu said .
they shouldn 't be failing like this .
every game we play is different .
i 'm going to illustrate it with some fairly concrete examples , but always pointing to the broader themes .
there are a large number of people on the internet , a very small fraction of them have photos of the mermaid parade .
when you build cooperation into the infrastructure , which is the flickr answer , you can leave the people where they are and you take the problem to the individuals , rather than moving the individuals to the problem .
what matters is this .
that sounds strange because we expect average and middle to be about the same , but they 're not at all .
you can hire those people as employees , you can coordinate their work and you can get some output .
right ? bad hire . right ?
it 's a revolution in that it 's a change in equilibrium .
these are groups of teenage girls who have taken on web logs , bulletin boards , other kinds of cooperative infrastructure , and have used it to set up support groups for remaining anorexic by choice .
now , i 'm not predicting 200 years of chaos as a result of this . 50 .
we have focused on the problems .
and so our national accounting system became fixated on what we can produce .
why don 't we create a measure of progress that shows that ?
to the top right of the graph , are countries which are doing reasonably well and producing well-being , but they 're using a lot of planet to get there .
what 's happening in costa rica ?
and the point really is , is that i think , probably everybody in this room would like society to get to 2050 without an apocalyptic something happening .
and this is where i think we can take a leaf out of systems theory , systems engineers , where they create feedback loops , put the right information at the right point of time .
and the first of these is to connect , is that your social relationships are the most important cornerstones of your life .
you tell one of them to spend it on themselves and one on other people .
if you 're living in iran , you 're facing censorship , harassment , arrest , torture -- at times , execution .
but also , i worry about the west , because often in this country , in this western world that we have , culture risks being a form of entertainment .
i am a nomadic artist .
being a visual artist , indeed , i am foremost interested to make art -- to make art that transcends politics , religion , the question of feminism , and become an important , timeless , universal work of art .
thank you so much .
and yet , even at this most fundamental level , context is everything .
identical in shape , size , spectral content .
there is no a priori reason why an " h " has to go between that " w " and " a. "
i take it from your response they don 't look the same anymore . right ?
if they are under the same light , reflecting the same amount of light to your eye , then they must be equally reflective .
keep blinking . every time you blink it will switch . alright ?
and they land on the flower . they stick their tongue in there , called a proboscis , and they drink sugar water .
well , one of the ways we do in my lab and studio is we translate the light into sound and we enable people to hear their visual world .
we are not defined by our central properties , by the bits that make us up .
the question is , " is that an illusion ? "
they do exist . here 's how they work .
but is there more that could be done for this corner of the labor market ?
so why do we have this disparity between these incredibly sophisticated markets at the top of the economy that are increasingly sucking more and more activity and resource out of the main economy into this rarefied level of trading , and what the rest of us have ?
let 's take britain as an example .
so , taxi journeys might be one example .
should they be moving to another part of the country where there 's a shortage of babysitters ?
so i said , " well , how many words do i get ? "
and now , when i tell people what i do , they move toward me .
and the third problem about the disease model is , in our rush to do something about people in trouble , in our rush to do something about repairing damage , it never occurred to us to develop interventions to make people happier , positive interventions .
they don 't spend time alone .
the first drawback is that it turns out the pleasant life , your experience of positive emotion , is heritable , about 50 percent heritable , and , in fact , not very modifiable .
he 's not consigned to the hell of unhappiness and that 's because len , like most of you , is enormously capable of flow .
you don 't look like debbie reynolds .
i hope all of you have such a person .
conversely , if you have none of the three , the empty life , the sum is less than the parts .
and if technology can , in the next decade or two , increase the pleasant life , the good life and the meaningful life , it will be good enough .
so what does that mean ?
it 'll dim .
i was to address a conference at a hotel .
we 've had others .
how do we solve it ?
the british philosopher bertrand russell was not a religious man , but he said , " it 's in our hearts that the evil lies , and it 's from our hearts that it must be plucked out . "
i find [ that ] young people all over the world are searching for something .
yes , to be sure , science has done much to push back certain types of human suffering .
many commentators have said that death is the forbidden subject of our generation .
i 've stood at the deathbed of several famous people , whom you would know .
i 've done a lot of speaking in germany and in france , and in different parts of the world -- 105 countries it 's been my privilege to speak in .
he experienced it in a way that went beyond scientific observation and reason .
i 'm the embodiment of all truth . "
how long are you staying ? "
that is a little bit too early .
i don 't think so .
do we really want to end up with 600 languages and the main one being english , or chinese ?
let me tell you a story about two scientists , two english scientists .
people who have no light , whether it 's physical or metaphorical , cannot pass our exams , and we can never know what they know .
it may be possible that we are not even able to build that much clean energy .
and we find that when we do that , we can , in fact , have a few places that are really hyper-dense within a wider fabric of places that are perhaps a little more comfortable and achieve the same results .
my favorite example is a drill . who here owns a drill , a home power drill ?
so we have visions like this .
these girls just needed a way to invite their fathers into their lives on their own terms .
at this moment , i saw an opportunity for the girls to rise to the occasion and to become their own heroes .
but after the dance , we all realized that dad still would be in jail .
and here we see a picture on top of a hill in central valley last december .
and in fact , america was the first country that ever did mail-delivery queens and in fact , it 's part of the postal code that you have to deliver queens by mail in order to make sure that we have enough bees in this country .
and he has a history of these trucks , and he 's moved these bees up and down the coast .
i mean , it 's the most ethical sweetener , and you know , it 's a dynamic and fun sweetener .
we have bumblebees on the top .
and that is that i think that what we have in our society is , we forgot our connection with nature .
and i encourage you to look at that .
and it seemed to me looking at that -- that tower burning and then falling , those towers burning and falling -- that in fact , one of the lessons here was that density kills .
they don 't have a center executive branch that you can take out and cause the whole thing to fail .
this is not the future king of england , although it looks like it .
and he 's tracking how many other weblogs linked to those weblogs , and so you have kind of an authority -- a weblog that has a lot of links to it is more authoritative than a weblog that has few links to it .
there 's a problem with the google zeitgeist , which is it often comes back with news that a lot of people are searching for britney spears pictures , which is not necessarily news .
but what 's interesting is you can then broaden the search and actually see interesting things and get a sense of what else is out there .
the question now -- and this is the really interesting question -- is , what kind of higher-level shape is emerging right now in the overall web ecosystem -- and particularly in the ecosystem of the blogs because they are really kind of at the cutting edge .
you 're not totally in control , but you 're changing the underlying rules in interesting ways because you have an end result which is maybe a more democratic spread of voices .
to be a boy really means not to be a girl .
when i spent my first weeks at panzi hospital i sat with women who sat and lined up every day to tell me their stories .
and i will tell you a very funny story .
and what i want to suggest is that , having talked to girls , because i just finished a new book called " i am an emotional creature : the secret life of girls around the world , " i 've been talking to girls for five years , and one of the things that i 've seen is true everywhere is that the verb that 's been enforced on girl is the verb " to please . "
the capacity for girls to overcome situations and to move on levels , to me , is mind-blowing .
the whole community has bought in to what she 's doing .
he said , " you are beautiful . you have grown into a gorgeous woman .
i can feel what you 're feeling as you 're feeling inside the feeling before .
oh , i know when the coconut 's about to fall .
can you say it with me ?
and it made me suspicious .
she has the world 's most absolutely watertight alibi .
and folks , you can buy a copy of bill clinton 's " my life " from the bookstore here at ted .
the first since this man , franklin delano roosevelt , who began his own unprecedented journey way back at his own first election , way back in a simpler time , way back in 1932 -- the year alberto giacometti made " the palace at four in the morning . "
leibniz , who came a little bit later -- this is 1679 -- showed that you didn 't even need subtraction .
such a computer would open up universes , which are , at the present , outside the range of any instruments .
you can read the text .
so , von neumann was already off in a theoretical cloud , doing abstract sorts of studies of how you could build reliable machines out of unreliable components .
" and the dawn came . " so they ran all night .
" we 've duplicated errors before . "
" dr. barricelli claims machine is wrong , code is right . "
and he went out of his way to say that he was not saying this was lifelike , or a new kind of life .
we 've been doing that since , you know , since we started pcr and synthesizing small strings of dna .
my new life is trying to understand what beauty is about , and " pretty , " and " emotions . "
is that a good way to play ping-pong ?
buy it anyway .
so , she 'd bring people into the room , and there 'd be a string hanging down here and a string hanging down here .
no big deal .
i 'm doing a lot ; most of my talk is subconscious ; it has been rehearsed and thought about a lot .
emotion is all about acting ; emotion is really about acting .
as opposed to this one , which is a pure behavioral watch , which probably keeps better time than the $ 13,000 watch i just showed you .
so we 've developed certain tactics and strategies to cover up .
this one i love .
holding down the right flank of the oecd , all the way on the other side , is greece .
so for example , if i 'm speaking in english , i have to speak grammatically differently if i 'm talking about past rain , " it rained yesterday , " current rain , " it is raining now , " or future rain , " it will rain tomorrow . "
if , on the other hand , you speak a futureless language , the present and the future , you speak about them identically .
from this dataset you actually learn that retired european families are extremely patient with survey takers .
it 's getting as close as possible to the thought experiment of finding two families both of whom live in brussels who are identical on every single one of these dimensions , but one of whom speaks flemish and one of whom speaks french ; or two families that live in a rural district in nigeria , one of whom speaks hausa and one of whom speaks igbo .
everyone 's familiar with cancer , but we don 't normally think of cancer as being a contagious disease .
this disease appears first as tumors , usually on the face or inside the mouth of affected tasmanian devils .
one in three people in this room will develop cancer at some stage in their lives .
i took these back to the lab .
well the answer is , it has .
and this is a photograph of dr. southam in 1957 injecting cancer into a volunteer , who in this case was an inmate in ohio state penitentiary .
and sure enough , she sang , or as derek called it , warbled , to him for his first few years of life .
so as soon as i tried to get near the piano , i was firmly shoved off .
not only can you say how many notes , it 's being able to play them all at the same time . here we are .
so you see , in your brain , derek , is this amazing musical computer that can instantly recalibrate , recalculate , all the pieces in the world that are out there .
dp : " chopsticks . "
but i am going talk about : what are the big problems in the world ?
where should we start on solving these problems ?
and one reason is that prioritization is incredibly uncomfortable .
likewise in communicable diseases .
they basically came up with a list where they said there were bad projects -- basically , projects where if you invest a dollar , you get less than a dollar back .
which is a little good , but not very much good .
we would significantly increase their ability to deal with many of the other problems that they have to deal with -- of course , in the long run , also to deal with global warming .
what this really does is that it makes us think about our priorities .
or as schelling put it , imagine if you were a rich -- as you will be -- a rich chinese , a rich bolivian , a rich congolese , in 2100 , thinking back on 2005 , and saying , " how odd that they cared so much about helping me a little bit through climate change , and cared so fairly little about helping my grandfather and my great grandfather , whom they could have helped so much more , and who needed the help so much more ? "
but the point , of course , is still to say , if you get another 100 billion dollars , we still want to spend that in the best possible way , don 't we ?
at the end of the day , you can disagree with the discussion of how we actually prioritize these , but we have to be honest and frank about saying , if there 's some things we do , there are other things we don 't do .
i will not forget where i come from .
so i am going to read a poem that was chosen just now .
rhythm is half silence .
one woman never did .
if you must , fear the unexploded .
so turbines grew . and they can now span up to three hundred feet at the hub height , but they can 't really go a lot higher , and more height is where the more wind is , and more power -- as much as twice as much .
your cessna would be 230 killowatts .
theater awakens our senses and opens the door to our imagination .
thank you .
it 's as much about bringing new disciplines inside this box as it is about taking theater out of its box .
it 's visual . it 's musical . it 's sensorial .
i truly believe that stem cell research is going to allow our children to look at alzheimer 's and diabetes and other major diseases the way we view polio today , which is as a preventable disease .
it really is extraordinary , because you can recapitulate many , many diseases in a dish , you can see what begins to go wrong in the cellular conversation well before you would ever see symptoms appear in a patient .
but imagine a different scenario , where we could have had an array , a genetically diverse array , of cardiac cells , and we could have actually tested that drug , vioxx , in petri dishes , and figured out , well , okay , people with this genetic type are going to have cardiac side effects , people with these genetic subgroups or genetic shoes sizes , about 25,000 of them , are not going to have any problems .
zipcar buys cars and parks them throughout dense metropolitan areas for people to use , by the hour and by the day , instead of owning their own cars .
so we have the peers that are providing the services and the product , and the company that 's doing the stuff that companies do .
i think of the difference of google video versus youtube .
you can earn 60 euros . isn 't that great ? yes or no ? "
type of thing that 's happening here , because individuals , if you 're a company , what happens is you might have 10 people who are in charge of innovation , or 100 people who are in charge of innovation .
a meditator .
and that led to henri bergson , the french philosopher , to say , " all the great thinkers of humanity have left happiness in the vague so that they could define -- each of them could define their own terms . "
and happiness , of course , is such a vague word , so let 's say well-being .
to have everything . if we miss something , it collapses .
at the opposite , everyone knows deep within that an act of selfless generosity , if from the distance , without anyone knowing anything about it , we could save a child 's life , make someone happy .
you cannot , in the same gesture , shake hand and give a blow .
mind transformation -- that is the very meaning of meditation .
we think of people suffering , we think of people we love , but at some point , it can be a state which is all pervading .
this is not a supplementary vitamin for the soul .
it 's pithy almost to the point of being meaningless , but it rings familiar and true , doesn 't it ?
this is the term that armies use when they 've lost a battle .
these graphs are compelling , they 're undulating , but from a human 's perspective , they 're actually not very useful .
we created technology and applications that engaged people 's imaginations , and it was really exciting .
so the goal of the original game zen bound is to wrap a rope around a wooden form .
for example , thought-controlled computing can teach children with add how to improve their focus .
imagine if you had access to data that allowed you to rank on a scale of overall happiness which people in your life made you the happiest , or what activities brought you joy .
other people . everyone is interested in other people .
valuation is just what you think it is , you know ?
you bring to the table such enormous processing power in this domain that you hardly even notice it .
and we steal their games . and we contrive them to our own purposes .
in doing this , what we 've discovered is that humans are literal canaries in social exchanges .
the interesting thing about studying cognition has been that we 've been limited , in a way .
so i 'm going to suggest that less stuff and less space are going to equal a smaller footprint .
by all means , we should buy and own some great stuff .
would that give me a little more freedom ?
but it 's not only that .
but design -- oh , my god .
so , i started out in ' 95 with this exhibition that was called mutant materials in contemporary design .
so , this morning i went to see on the dictionary and it said that there was this gentleman that was not branding its cattle .
and sometimes by doing this kind of research , you encounter such beautiful ideas of design .
and that makes sense .
once upon a time , at the age of 24 , i was a student at st. john 's medical college in bangalore .
and i don 't mean the whole economy , because to grow an economy of india to the size of u.k. -- that 's a piece of cake , with one billion people .
but , japan , in contrast to india and china , maintained its national sovereignty .
and it 's the new century now . health is getting better , united kingdom , united states .
health services were provided .
if i would split china , look here , shanghai has already catched up .
it 's quite interesting , isn 't it ?
can you see the bubble ?
so , social investments in health , education and infrastructure , and electricity is really what is needed in india and china .
and that 's because today we can see what 's inside of the brain , rather than just looking at its overall shape .
and very quickly cajal realized that neurons don 't operate alone , but rather make connections with others that form circuits just like in a computer .
i 'd like to leave you with the following thought : green fluorescent protein and antibodies are both totally natural products at the get-go .
the facts is , a conservation drone doesn 't cost very much more than a good laptop computer or a decent pair of binoculars .
this is a wild orangutan happily feeding on top of a palm tree , seemingly oblivious to our drone that was flying overhead , not once but several times .
building drones for us is a constant work in progress .
it carries a variety of sensors , and the photo quality of some of these sensors can be as high as one to two centimeters per pixel .
or we can use cells alone , either your very own cells or different stem cell populations .
but even now , 2011 , there 's still certain cells that we just can 't grow from the patient .
or if we 're going to use larger structures to replace larger structures , we can then use the patient 's own cells , or some cell population , and the biomaterials , the scaffolds , together .
you can hold it like a liver , but it has no cells ; it 's just a skeleton of the liver .
once it 's scanned , it sends information in the correct layers of cells where they need to be .
put a pair of gloves here .
i was able to do more things .
i was a little kid , and i was like , " yeah . i 'll have that . i 'll have that surgery . "
and so for me , it was really exciting just to see what it looks like if you could step outside and into a larger context , as though you were an astronaut , and see these two things as an object , because they are so intimately bound , and one is meaningless without the other .
so the evolution of this -- i gather this isn 't your first pendulum .
and i keep it around for a couple of weeks , and i 'm contemplating it , and i 'll do another session with it and bring it up to another level , where all of this becomes the background , the depth of it .
and that 's something that in painting i 've never seen done .
ts : as it turns out , this device kind of comes in handy , because i don 't have to have the fine motor skills to do , that i can operate slides , which is more of a mental process .
jh : well , i love the idea that somewhere within this idea of fine motion and control with the traditional skills that you have with your hand , some sort of more elemental force gets revealed , and that 's the beauty here .
and at the same time , certainly in rwanda , it destroyed the local retailing industry .
and if you remember one thing from what i want to talk about today , it 's that the only way to end poverty , to make it history , is to build viable systems on the ground that deliver critical and affordable goods and services to the poor , in ways that are financially sustainable and scaleable .
this guy in pink is a social entrepreneur named ami tabar .
one : production is too low . two : price is too high .
we took a lesson from ideo , one of our favorite companies , and quickly did a prototyping on this , and took jacqueline into the area where she lives .
i 'm sure you 're trying to figure out , " well , how does this thing work ? "
and then also , you 're trying to stay very , very , very still because little movements with other parts of your body will affect the pitch , or sometimes if you 're holding a low note -- -- and breathing will make it ...
he drew people , anatomy , plants , animals , landscapes , buildings , water , everything .
before we go into these faces , i should explain why i have some right to talk about them .
and if we now compare the face of the statue , with the face of the musician , you see the very same features again .
the errors we make are actually predictable .
it feels like we might almost just be built to make errors in certain ways .
first problem is just , well , where should we start ?
they were these kind of weird things .
and so our monkey marketplace was born .
they really cared about their monkey token dollar .
sounds great , but you get one more choice to earn a little bit more money .
you can either take a risky loss -- so i 'll flip a coin . if it comes up heads , you 're going to actually lose a lot .
that means when we 're in a risk mindset -- excuse me , when we 're in a loss mindset , we actually become more risky , which can actually be really worrying .
people here played it safe .
well , what we 've shown is that , first of all , we can actually give the monkeys a financial currency , and they do very similar things with it .
you know , think of our evolutionary predilection for eating sweet things , fatty things like cheesecake .
the hope is that you all will think about your limitations , not necessarily as unovercomable , but to recognize them , accept them and then use the world of design to actually figure them out .
it 's unaffordable globally .
so let me just make sure . hey , dr. batiuk . can you hear me okay ?
ed : all right . well , i guess we 'll double check it when i come in .
now the smartphones that we 're already carrying can clearly have diagnostic devices like ultrasounds plugged into them , and a whole array of others , today , and as sensing is built into these , we 'll be able to do vital signs monitor and behavioral monitoring like we 've never had before .
there 's a couple of the folks here . you 'll recognize dr. batiuk .
i was optimizing my life for quality of life , and quality of life for me means time in snow .
so " thank you " feel likes a really trite word , but thank you from the bottom of my heart for saving my life .
what you 're doing is , when you stand up , potential energy to kinetic energy , potential energy to kinetic energy .
we are literally re-inventing the wheel here .
so , inspired by that we wanted to build a robot that can climb a structured cliff environment .
so , this is some of the early feasibility experiments .
it 's a 12 degrees of freedom robotic arm .
so , in 2006 , now it 's really time to have fun .
thank you .
where do we get this spark of imagination ?
nobody criticizes any opinion .
this picture in the back this is 3 a.m. in the morning .
let 's take a look .
these are the guys who wrote the first pc virus .
today , they are no longer being written by hobbyists and teenagers .
every single google search you type is saved and sent to the criminals .
they also use the global nature of internet to their advantage .
well the yellow part of the code is now decrypted .
now that 's a nice car for a 20-something year-old kid in st. petersburg .
this is what runs everything around us .
i 've spent my life defending the net , and i do feel that if we don 't fight online crime , we are running a risk of losing it all .
they had no safety , no real technology .
well , we used to use trampettes . in the old days , that 's all they had .
they did it by remote control .
we went to cambridge university , the other university , and spoke to a doctor of mechanical engineering there , a physicist who taught us that it had to be 37 miles an hour .
this is a parachutist with another parachutist doing exactly the same thing .
so that 's the balloon , big gas balloon .
you need a pressure breathing system with a g suit that squeezes you , that helps you to breathe in and helps you to exhale .
it 's hundreds of feet high . it 's enormous .
he left the company because he saw , as some other people in the space suit industry , an emerging market for space suits for space tourists .
and it doesn 't look far different when it 's inflated , as you can see from the picture down there .
he meant that you can see the sky and that you can experience the sun .
and they really practice what they preach because this office doesn 't have any electric lighting at all .
and then finally , kelly 's play of brilliants attitude , that really some play of the skyline of hong kong , or perhaps the chandelier in the opera house , or in the theater here , which is a decoration , the icing on the cake , something playful , something that is just an addition to the architectural environment , i would say .
and it is all about this planet .
now we have led , but here you see the latest one , and you see how incredibly small it is .
so we have to rethink the way we light our cities .
where have they come from ? where are they going ?
so , i 'm going to be sometimes using kind of clinical language , and so it 's not going to sound as warm and fuzzy as your average compassion talk .
that 's the bad news . the good news is compassion is natural .
and it 's good to treat other people well .
are you on the edges of your seats here ?
it 's going to either be win-win or lose-lose for them .
any form of interdependence , or non-zero-sum relationship forces you to acknowledge the humanity of people .
this is not the same as compassion , but it 's conducive to compassion . it opens the channels for compassion .
but , nobody ever said that doing god 's work was going to be easy . thanks .
i call myself a maker of things .
i started as an apprentice to a hungarian craftsman , and this taught me what the guild system was in middle ages .
there he made an art department for me where i worked for several months .
ez : well , if you are sure , i have to tell you that within five minutes i will talk very fast .
and the way bacteria make a living is that they consume nutrients from the environment , they grow to twice their size , they cut themselves down in the middle , and one cell becomes two , and so on and so on .
they live this sort of boring life where they grow and divide , and they 've always been considered to be these asocial reclusive organisms .
again , another plug for the animals in the ocean , vibrio fischeri lives in this squid .
when the molecule increases to a certain amount -- which says something about the number of cells -- it locks down into that receptor and information comes into the cells that tells the cells to turn on this collective behavior of making light .
each molecule fits into its partner receptor and no other .
what the important thing is that we learned is that every bacterium has exactly the same enzyme and makes exactly the same molecule .
we 've also done the same thing with the pink system .
i hope that what you 've learned is that bacteria can distinguish self from other .
thanks .
ok , i 'm not going to spend too much time on that , but what i want to talk about is some of the disconnects that appear when an author publishes a book that in fact , the publishing process -- just because of the fact that it 's complicated , it 's heavy , books are expensive -- creates a sort of a wall between authors of books and the ultimate users of books , be they teachers , students or just general readers .
so , create . so what are some of the people that are using these kind of tools ?
we 're going to be providing content to them in a whole range of different languages .
right , books that might sell 100 copies a year , 1,000 copies a year .
we needed a community to do it and we needed new tools to be able to interconnect these ideas , and i think that really , in a sense , what we 're trying to do is make minsky 's dream come to a reality , where you can imagine all the books in a library actually starting to talk to each other .
if you have not , you must learn about it . creativecommons.org.
ok , you come to ted . why do you come to ted ?
hemingway had his writing space .
take this place for example .
but they were also -- i was really impressed by how personalized they were , and how much work went into them .
but that could have happened -- maybe , maybe not .
so someone could conceptually perceive that as a mistake .
you have some people who do .
one is the thylacine project .
now , when biologists saw this , they were agog .
we used ultraviolet radiation to do that .
the second project i want to talk to you about is the thylacine project .
by 10,000 years ago , they had disappeared from new guinea , and unfortunately by 4,000 years ago , somebodies , we don 't know who this was , introduced dingoes -- this is a very archaic kind of a dog — into australia .
and i was studying skulls , trying to figure out their relationships to other sorts of animals , and i saw this jar , and here , in the jar , was a little girl thylacine pup , perhaps six months old .
we would hope that we 'll be able to get that dna back into a viable form , and then , much like we 've done with the lazarus project , get that stuff into an egg of a host species .
you know , some kind of weird hybrid chimera ?
and he told me , as it all was flooding back in memories .
and i 'm positive it wouldn 't .
so this story is the first of 18 chapters in my new body of work titled " a living man declared dead and other chapters . "
he oversaw land acquisition on behalf of the palestine land development company whose work led to the establishment of a jewish state .
and in this particular chapter , it 's children whose mothers wouldn 't allow them to travel to the photographic shoot for fear that their fathers would kidnap them during it .
and i was therefore able to photograph the fully assembled remains .
another section of the family presented their clothing , as opposed to their physical presence , because they didn 't want to be identified with the past that i was highlighting .
chapter 17 is an exploration of the absence of a bloodline and the absence of a history .
and there 's this relentless persistence of birth and death and an unending collection of stories in between .
so i think of the book as a body , and i think of the book as a technology .
and i think that 's what 's happening with books now , now that most of our technology , most of our information , most of our personal and cultural records are in digital form , i think it 's really allowing the book to become something new .
so , what does a plant need in order to grow ?
so , we humans get it from the things we eat : plants , vegetables , fruits , and also from eggs , meat and milk .
modern agriculture depends on phosphorus .
but we are indeed heading for a major crisis , and i 'd like people to become aware of this problem .
it cannot go further in its search for phosphorus .
the plant is only able to seek out soluble forms .
in conclusion , i am a scientist and a dreamer .
they gave it back to the wise old woman .
let me give you just a story , an example .
and so the third side reminds us of that .
let me just ask you one question first .
what 's the origin story of the middle east ?
they need to be able to live the story . how would you do that ?
and then a few years ago , a group of us , about 25 of us from about 10 different countries , decided to see if we could retrace the footsteps of abraham , going from his initial birthplace in the city of urfa in southern turkey , northern mesopotamia .
in cincinnati , for instance , that organized a walk from a church to a mosque to a synagogue and all had an abrahamic meal together .
and so she told our team there , she said , " you have made me visible in a village where people were once ashamed to look at me . "
it could be done anywhere .
and that was what i did .
and that 's more or less the story of the coral reefs of the caribbean , and increasingly , tragically , the coral reefs worldwide .
and they tasted really good .
it 's a bit of an embarrassment .
you 're looking at the entire northwestern gulf of mexico ; you 're looking at one toxic dinoflagellate bloom that can kill fish , made by that beautiful little creature on the lower right .
for all the denial of climate change by government leaders , the cia and the navies of norway and the u.s. and canada , whatever are busily thinking about how they will secure their territory in this inevitability from their point of view .
we really don 't know .
i 'm a believer in global warming , and my record is good on the subject .
now if you look at the cost of opec , it cost seven trillion dollars -- on the milken institute study last year -- seven trillion dollars since 1976 , is what we paid for oil from opec .
and the united states uses about 20 million barrels a day , which is about 25 percent of all the oil used everyday in the world .
but the days of cheap oil are over .
you 're going to find , and i 'll tell you in just a minute , what you 're looking for to make it happen .
so what you have is natural gas is the bridge fuel , is the way i see it .
that 'll make you abandon something .
don 't i wish .
you 've made the money you need .
you can 't -- okay .
i don 't understand why the media is focused on eastern pennsylvania .
if someone comes to you with a plan that really looks like it might be part of this solution , are you ready to invest in those technologies , even if they aren 't maximized for profits , they might be maximized for the future health of the planet ?
i get it .
i mean , who knows , right ?
no one is exactly shocked .
how could they say that we as a group were not deserving of equal rights as somebody else ?
my goal is to show the humanity that exists in every one of us through the simplicity of a face .
i know that this is a talk , but i 'd like to have a minute of just quiet and have you just look at these faces because there is nothing that i can say that will add to them .
i found that most people fall on a spectrum of what i have come to refer to as " grey . "
so is it me particularly that you would choose to deny the right to housing , the right to adopt children , the right to marriage , the freedom to shop here , live here , buy here ?
that 's clearly what we 've got to do next .
that 's what we tell them to do .
why can we not make our politicians change ?
you get more tourists . you get more investors .
it measures , or at least it tries to measure , exactly how much each country on earth contributes not to its own population but to the rest of humanity .
they 're also all rich .
i 've had enough hearing about prosperous , wealthy , fast-growing countries .
i think they can change your life , and i think we can use it to change the way that our politicians and our companies behave , and in doing so , we can change the world .
so you can bump things -- they 're all physically , you know , manipulable and stuff .
more boring , but you still have that kind of colliding and bumping .
i am told every day , by every face i see , every wall i face , that i am wrong .
what can creatures like us know of such things ?
it actually got so bad that somebody put our country up for sale on ebay .
what does that mean ?
well i 'll give you my straight talk about this .
but in spite of that , i went through the first 10 or 15 years of my career mostly in denial of being a woman .
whenever they did those news stories about building violations in new york , they would put the report in front of our building .
i 'm not an actor .
and then the human waits , until it 's their turn again .
and it was like a lightning bolt .
it sometimes acts without knowing everything it has to know .
so , this is what musicians called a call and response interaction , and it also fits very well , robots and artificial intelligence .
to sort of show that it doesn 't like what the other person is playing -- and maybe show whatever beat it 's feeling at the moment .
they really liked that the robot was enjoying the music .
thank you .
and so i went home , and i made a prototype of this hat .
and so actually it allows for an intense emotional exchange , but is serves to absorb the specificity of the words that are delivered .
and this has really gotten me thinking about this experience of the initial encounter .
we 're entering a second generation of no progress in terms of human flight in space . in fact , we 've regressed .
the ones that flew and landed ok because there were no trained pilots who had good flying qualities by definition .
the most impressive airplane ever , i believe , was designed only a dozen years after the first operational jet .
there is no growth . there 's no activity . there 's no nothing .
' what do you use it for ? ' come over . it does frogger . " ok .
relatively soon , you 'll be able to buy a ticket and fly higher and faster than the highest-performance military operational airplane . it 's never happened before .
the russians actually flew a supersonic transport before the concorde .
it doesn 't emit in the electromagnetic spectrum . it doesn 't reflect .
galaxies themselves are not strewn randomly in space ; they tend to cluster .
a ray of light leaves the galaxy and travels through the universe for perhaps billions of years before it enters the telescope or your eye .
now , it will only be a perfect ring if the source , the deflector and the eyeball , in this case , are all in a perfectly straight line .
and the answer is yes .
and it 's not because galaxies are moving away from each other through space .
but we don 't have a good motivation for putting it in there at this point , ok .
so a crystal that will ring if that happens .
i always tell the students that we could also call neuroscientists some sort of astronomer , because we are dealing with a system that is only comparable in terms of number of cells to the number of galaxies that we have in the universe .
as you can see here , she likes to use a joystick , like any one of us , any of our kids , to play this game .
the model of the self that aurora had in her mind has been expanded to get one more arm .
the legends that you see in the movie don 't appear for the monkey .
this is cb1 fulfilling its dream in japan under the control of the brain activity of a primate .
the napalm is burning there quite nicely .
if it sank , it would be a whole different story as far as an oil spill .
you might notice that many gas pumps , including this one , are designed to look like atms .
okay , so the politics of oil are very moral in the united states .
so , you might be wondering why it is that , every time we have high oil prices or an oil spill , we call these ceos down to washington , and we sort of pepper them with questions in public and we try to shame them .
this is why these moments of these oil spills are so important .
one of the places we put in a big oil project in chad , with exxon .
now on the one hand , the price at the pump is not really very high when you consider the actual cost of the oil , but on the other hand , the fact that people have no other transit options means that they pay a large amount of their income into just getting back and forth to work , generally in a fairly crummy car .
we have policies that reward sprawl -- we have all kinds of policies .
and at the same time , you have a number that you can call to get more information on commuting , or a low-interest loan on a different kind of car , or whatever it is you 're going to need to actually reduce your gasoline dependence .
they had all sorts of different data formats , all sorts , all kinds of documentation systems .
that has been the most exciting thing , not the technology , not the things people have done with it , but actually the community , the spirit of all these people getting together , sending the emails .
he put up a slide a little bit like this .
so , i can go ahead and look that thing up .
data comes in fact in lots and lots of different forms .
and i 'm going to ask you to practice that , ok ?
of course , there 's no page on the web which has answered that question because nobody has asked that question before .
so i could go into edit mode , i could select the theater , i could add down at the bottom the name , and i could save it back .
i want you to demand it .
i had invented drybath , the world 's first bath-substituting lotion .
there is something you know about me , something very personal , and there is something i know about every one of you and that 's very central to your concerns .
i appeal to your own experience .
you have no way of assuring that there will be another moment given to you , and yet , that 's the most valuable thing that can ever be given to us , this moment , with all the opportunity that it contains .
learning patience , for instance .
we have to stop . we have to get quiet .
but whatever it is , if we take this opportunity , we go with it , we are creative , those are the creative people , and that little stop , look , go , is such a potent seed that it can revolutionize our world .
thank you .
men typically listen reductively .
so , we 're inviting into our lives the voices of people who are not present with us .
and thirdly , if you 're in bad sound , it 's fine to put your fingers in your ears or just move away from it .
devotional music , good -- mozart , good .
so , i 'd like to spend a few minutes with you folks today imagining what our planet might look like in a thousand years .
so , for all these reasons , i think we need better materials , and there are three key principles we can use to guide these materials .
in our process , we basically use it as a glue .
because the manufacturing process is our organism .
you want to be able to do this anywhere in the world and not worry about peak rice hull or peak cottonseed hulls , because you have multiple choices .
initially , or , you know , as people would say , you know , in fact the more aggressive people who are supporting the western innovative model , say , " where are the indian googles , ipods and viagras , if the indians are so bloody smart ? "
once you take this , there 's no reason to restrict innovation , the beneficiaries of innovation , just to end users .
the third kind of invisible innovation coming out of india is what we call process innovations , because of an injection of intelligence by indian firms .
you can 't be a professor without having been a student .
ladies and gentlemen , thank you very much .
i was thinking about the recent ongoings in congress , where the president is offering 8.4 billion dollars to try to get the start vote .
i said , " that 's good . that 's good .
you ask her where she lives -- where does she live in exile ?
an ira driver was shot , and his car plowed into people on the side of the street .
and if each of us who cares about the different things we care about got up off our butts and volunteered as much time as we could , we would change this world , we would save this world .
many of them told us the stories about how they came to own their home through their grandparents or great-grandparents , who were one of 1.6 million people who migrated from the rural south to the industrial north , as depicted in this painting by jacob lawrence , " the great migration . "
now some of our audience members also tell us about some of the positive things that are happening in their communities , and many of them are banding together to take control of some of the vacant lots , and they 're starting community gardens , which are creating a great sense of community stewardship , but they 're very , very clear to tell us that this is not enough , that they want to see their neighborhoods return to the way that their grandparents had found them .
or we could use it as research plots , where we can use it to remediate contaminated soils , or we could use it to generate energy .
all the theories in physics that we have today properly explain what is called normal matter -- the stuff that we 're all made of -- and that 's four percent of the universe .
and where in the world would you find such water ?
it 's very harsh conditions .
i want to spend most of my time on this part of the world .
and the engineers , the technicians , the physicists have all got to assemble on the ross ice shelf , because antarctica -- i won 't go into the reasons why -- but it 's one of the most favorable places for doing these balloon launches , except for the weather .
and i would like to share with you a launch .
and here is another picture of them .
and i became increasingly more and more agitated , because i was there not only to be with them , but also to ride and create a team and i didn 't know what to do .
so what you have to do is stay close and try to reach in and pet his shoulder or give him a piece of chocolate .
and it took me exactly two months of complete frustration to realize that this vision was misplaced , and that there was another vision supremely more important and more readily available .
you stand with your bike at the beginning of february .
we visit kibbutzim that were established by holocaust survivors .
and this is the single most exciting adventure that we have ever been on .
if you think you 're successful or cockroaches are successful , it turns out that there 's ten trillion trillion pleurococcus sitting out there .
again , we didn 't know this thing was there three years ago .
and if we do that , and insert this into a fertilized wolf 's egg , we may give birth to an animal that hasn 't walked the earth since 1936 .
and when it does that , pushes a .exe , what it does is , it executes the first line of code , which reads just like that , aatcagggaccc , and that means : make a root .
okay ?
in mll , it 's the middle set of genes , and in aml , it 's the bottom set of genes .
it 's free . no one 's reading it . they 're focusing on the war ; they 're focusing on bush ; they 're not interested in life .
because it really matters who speaks life .
not integrated circuits : indians and chinese .
you would drink a little beer with breakfast and have a little wine at lunch , a little gin -- particularly around 1650 -- and top it off with a little beer and wine at the end of the day .
all of these concepts , as kind of rhetorically florid as they are , share this basic assumption , which is that an idea is a single thing , it 's something that happens often in a wonderful illuminating moment .
and this is what they ended up coming with .
and one of the problems with this is that people are actually -- when you research this field -- people are notoriously unreliable , when they actually kind of self-report on where they have their own good ideas , or their history of their best ideas .
and all of a sudden , the basic algorithm of natural selection kind of pops into his head and he says , " ah , at last , i had a theory with which to work . "
and it 's monday morning , and the news has just broken about this satellite that 's now orbiting the planet .
and they start writing the kind of date stamp , time stamps for each little bleep that they record .
could you work on that problem ? "
i 'm actually wearing the device right now and we 've sort of cobbled it together with components that are off the shelf -- and that , by the way , only cost 350 dollars at this point in time .
he can ask for additional information .
thank you .
and mind you , most of the energy is not used to transmit the radio waves , it is used to cool the base stations .
it 's light , and light has been around for many millions of years .
and it has a very nice acute property .
there 's a receiver .
you don 't notice the subtle changes in the amplitude that we impress onto this light bulb .
so it 's everywhere in a day there is light .
in hospitals , for new medical instruments ; in streets for traffic control .
and what was so amazing to me , and what fits right in with what we 're all talking about here at ted , is that there , right in the middle of this rainforest , was some solar panels -- the first in that part of ecuador -- and that was mainly to bring water up by pump so that the women wouldn 't have to go down .
because the chimps have a very promiscuous mating society .
anyway , david greybeard -- and i saw that he was picking little pieces of grass and using them to fish termites from their underground nest .
sometimes they hunt -- not that often , but when they hunt , they show sophisticated cooperation , and they share the prey .
their culture is being destroyed , along with the animals upon whom they depend .
and so many of these diseases , like asthma and certain kinds of cancers , are on the increase around places where our filthy toxic waste is dumped .
then , you see , it is a message of hope .
we want to clear away the toxic soil from this area and have an organic garden .
one -- one to two .
even after the 11th of september -- and i was in new york and i felt the fear -- nevertheless , there was so much human courage , so much love and so much compassion .
well we have a whole o.r. team , general anesthesia , nurses , and another doctor across from me .
and played around with this a little bit .
thanks .
one feature is the tradition of religious dualism : consciousness is not a part of the physical world .
it 's a computer program running in the brain .
if you 're not talking about that , you 're not talking about consciousness .
i don 't think that for a moment , because , i mean , descartes may have made a lot of mistakes , but he was right about this .
now , think of what i told you .
their existence is observer-relative .
i mean , you have patients that actually suffer pains , and you try to get an objective science of that .
like this . and let me mark it so we can recognize it when we see it again .
voice : don 't tell , or it won 't come true .
mt : yeah , but i guess my hand is better . we beat the odds .
and this isn 't some suburban iphone-using teen phenomenon .
kids are just sending us these text messages because texting is so familiar and comfortable to them and there 's nowhere else to turn that they 're sending them to us .
or maybe there 's some anecdotal evidence .
so i did . i went home , i grabbed a pencil , and i just started letting my hand shake and shake .
and it was then that i thought back to my jittery hands .
then i opened it up to creating art that was destroyed naturally .
looking at limitations as a source of creativity changed the course of my life .
there 's an enormous amount of anatomical variation .
and so i thought , " here 's a problem that just cries out for a skeletal system -- not one like this one , but one like this one -- because , functionally , a skeleton is any system that supports tissue and transmits forces .
so he sat me down , and he warned me .
so i spent a long , long time thinking about it .
if the wall around the erectile tissue wasn 't there , if it wasn 't reinforced in this way , the shape would change , but the inflated penis would not resist bending , and erection simply wouldn 't work .
it increases the risk of everything from the common cold to cardiovascular disease .
it 's called the social stress test .
and normally , we interpret these physical changes as anxiety or signs that we aren 't coping very well with the pressure .
if you raised your hand and said you 'd had a lot of stress in the last year , we could have saved your life , because hopefully the next time your heart is pounding from stress , you 're going to remember this talk and you 're going to think to yourself , this is my body helping me rise to this challenge .
your stress response wants to make sure you notice when someone else in your life is struggling so that you can support each other .
and so we see once again that the harmful effects of stress on your health are not inevitable .
and the reason , i only worked out just the other day , which is when you go to a drinks party and you stand up and you hold a glass of red wine and you talk endlessly to people , you don 't actually want to spend all the time talking .
every now and then an electric shock is applied to the floor , which pains the dogs .
i think psychological value is great to be absolutely honest .
you have to go in and you have to have a cost-benefit analysis , a feasibility study , an roi study and so forth .
i 'm merely saying that when you solve problems , you should look at all three of these equally and you should seek as far as possible to find solutions which sit in the sweet spot in the middle .
one of the great mistakes , i think , of economics is it fails to understand that what something is , whether it 's retirement , unemployment , cost , is a function , not only of its amount , but also its meaning .
he 's an austrian school economist who was first active in the first half of the 20th century in vienna .
one of them creates , perhaps , the primary product -- the thing we think we 're paying for -- the other one creates a context within which we can enjoy and appreciate that product .
but i 'm british , that 's the way we like it .
in fact , i grew up observing two different kinds of womanhood .
it 's an old eastern tradition based on the knowledge that it 's not healthy for a human being to spend too much time staring at his own reflection .
it was here that i had my first encounter with what i call the " representative foreigner . "
in the face of death and destruction , our mundane differences evaporated , and we all became one even if for a few hours .
stories accompany me , keeping my pieces and memories together , like an existential glue .
when identity politics tries to put labels on us , it is our freedom of imagination that is in danger .
chekhov said , " the solution to a problem and the correct way of posing the question are two completely separate things .
when the poet and mystic , rumi , met his spiritual companion , shams of tabriz , one of the first things the latter did was to toss rumi 's books into water and watch the letters dissolve .
as long as it comes from our hearts , we can write about anything and everything .
for me , i look at the paintings on the wall and i think , somebody has decided to put them there , thinks they 're good enough to be on that wall , but i don 't always see it .
why not apply that to our looking at paintings ?
so here 's how i came up with the story .
she 's in the studio . he 's got her in the studio , they 're together .
he 's an 18th-century french painter best known for his still lifes , but he did occasionally paint people .
this is a tudor portrait bought by the national portrait gallery .
you put all those together , and you 've got your story to fill in that gap that makes you keep coming back .
despite drinking steadily all afternoon , he was still pale .
which struck me as particularly remarkable during one session with the novel when i realized that i was being swept along on this remarkable , vivid journey in translation .
now comedy travels along a distinct wavelength from other forms of language .
the description perfectly captured edwards ' personal vanity .
have at it you radical bastards . the field is yours .
and my guess here -- and i have no research on this -- is that if you really were to look back at it and if you could research it , you 'd find out that comedy is the second oldest viral profession .
shortly after the conference was over , joel got a request for a signed copy from the head of the epa in washington whose wall it now hangs on .
my point is here , people have a choice -- just like the indian lady could wear her sari or the japanese woman could wear her kimono .
in a time where the world is becoming personalized , when the mobile phone , the burger , the telephone , everything has its own personal identity , how should we perceive ourselves and how should we perceive others ?
so i think women in our society are becoming leaders , because they realize that for their future generations , it 's very important to maintain our cultural identities .
and i think with time , in the years to come we 'll be learning a lot about our picassos , our legers and our cezannes .
sm : going back to straddling between east and west , last month we had our second doha tribeca film festival here in doha .
it 's a video game move from " star fox . "
rickroll was this bait and switch , really simple , classic bait and switch .
i didn 't instruct them to do it ; they just decided that that 's what they wanted .
they matched , they found his myspace .
and i 'm just curious whether you sometimes lie awake in the night worrying that you 've opened pandora 's box .
cp : cats and dogs were mentioned too .
the content is not dinner table conversation in the least .
and after injury , blood vessels actually have to grow under the scab in order to heal a wound .
then they can 't get any larger because they don 't have a blood supply , so they don 't have enough oxygen or nutrients .
well , i 've just shown you two very different types of cancer that both responded to antiangiogenic therapy .
and , in fact , the first pioneering treatments for people , as well as dogs , are already becoming available .
so here 's a test system we developed .
and here are some common drugs that have been associated with reducing the risk of cancer in people .
and , like a tumor , fat grows when blood vessels grow .
william li : so there are antiangiogenic treatments that are fda approved , and if you 're a cancer patient or working for one or advocating for one , you should ask about them .
none of those things happened , and astonishingly , if you look at what actually happened in my lifetime , the average per-capita income of the average person on the planet , in real terms , adjusted for inflation , has tripled .
the differences are what interest me , because the one on the left was made to a pretty unvarying design for about a million years -- from one-and-a-half million years ago to half a million years ago .
what 's the process that 's having the same effect in cultural evolution as sex is having in biological evolution ?
he doesn 't need adam .
go back to this image of the axe and the mouse , and ask yourself : " who made them and for who ? "
we 're able to draw upon specialization and exchange to raise each other 's living standards .
and she doesn 't have to go on an exhausting hunt and try and kill a warthog .
trade is 10 times as old as farming .
the tasmanians were isolated .
so we 've created something called the collective brain .
and this is the space probe cassini pirouetting through the ice rings of saturn .
so what were these strange noises ?
over the next few years , astronomers connected up their antennas to loudspeakers and learned about our radio sky , about jupiter and the sun , by listening .
it 's bigger .
a local newspaper spelled out , " there is no survivor , there is no future , there is no life to be recreated in this form ever again . "
all she needed from those specimens at the smithsonian was a little bit of toe pad tissue , because down in there is what is called ancient dna .
you have to figure out exactly what genes matter .
another amazing story came from alberto fernández-arias .
he showed how all of this can be put together .
another success story is the mountain gorilla in central africa .
we 're also going to push ahead with the passenger pigeon .
this is a long , slow process -- one of the things i like about it , it 's multi-generation .
if you 're multiplying the rig , so you multiply how many layers of absorbent you 're using , you can collect a lot more .
and this is exactly what we 're looking [ for ] if we want to pull something long and heavy .
the other thing is , most boats , when they reach a certain speed , and they are going on waves , they start to hit and slap on the surface of the water , and a lot of the energy moving forward is lost .
less than one week after , this is a team in eindhoven , it 's a school of engineering .
this is what our teammates , we dream of at night .
our breakthrough was to create an algorithm that unfolds the cortex , so that we can map the signals closer to its source , and therefore making it capable of working across a mass population .
he just hangs out . he 's relaxed .
same sort of drill . so : one , two , three , go .
and of course , also to the lighting -- turning them on or off .
my head snapped back over my red seat .
many years passed .
it seemed that we could be nothing more than genes and experience , but how to tease out the one from the other ?
anyway , mohamed told me what perhaps he would not have told another stranger .
" the crash changed both of our lives , " i said .
the report finished and abed spoke .
there was much i wished to say to abed .
and then i said , " goodbye . "
pm : so how large is the collection ?
so it evolved .
and i really dedicated myself to that , both at the u.n. and then as secretary of state .
so we managed to get two women judges on this war crimes tribunal .
and my male colleagues kind of got it all of a sudden .
the thought that you wouldn 't want to transfer electric power wirelessly , no one ever thought of that .
40 billion of these things built .
it 's a resonant phenomenon for which he actually received a macarthur fellowship award , which is nicknamed the genius award , last september , for his discovery .
home electronics .
the 10 seconds actually are because we -- i don 't know if any of you have ever thought about plugging a t.v. in when you use just a cord .
it runs the android operating system .
so , thank you very much .
so if you engulf planet or large number of asteroids , you will have this lithium-6 isotope in the spectrum of the star .
which is used actually to identify chemical elements in a cool matter , which is absorbing exactly at those frequencies .
it 's the only place where you can produce , actually , osmium .
these stars are normal like the sun . age , everything was normal .
this is the sound of an alpha cen .
but if you want to know about a life on extrasolar planets , you have to do this job .
one is , for instance , technetium is a radioactive element with a decay time of 4.2 million years .
and this was the 1960s when actually all the streets in this neighborhood were named after confederate war generals .
that sent me to an x-ray , then to an mri .
" i believe my girls will have plenty of opportunities in their lives , " i wrote these men .
and she loved the idea , but she quickly started rejecting my nominees .
he was like , " yeah . cows sleep standing up .
he said , " i want to see you back here girls , at the end of this experience , covered in mud . "
because i was in the hospital after , i think it was my fourth round of chemo when my numbers went to zero , and i had basically no immune system .
it is an invitation , maybe even a mandate , to enter the most vital arenas of human life , the most sensitive and the most frightening , the ones that we never want to go to , but when we do go there , we feel incredibly transformed when we do .
someone asked me if he cried when i asked him to be in the council of dads .
you nearly fall with one leg , then you catch yourself with the other .
he 's the president of the international society of limb salvage , which is the least euphemistic term i 've ever heard .
may you find a mud puddle to jump in someplace , or find a way to get over , around , or through any wall that stands between you and one of your dreams .
one of the problems is coming up with the right target .
but the entire planet warms up when there 's a big el nino .
we go out for months at a time and drill into the sea bed to recover sediments that tell us stories of climate change , right .
because it 's partly floating , you can imagine , is sea level rises a little bit , the ice lifts off the bed , and then it can break off and float north .
so what that means is , what it tells us is that the ross sea region , this ice shelf , melted back and formed anew about 35 times .
and it 's covered with algae . that 's what happens .
we 're not killing the colony ; we 're taking a small core sample out of the top .
we can analyze the carbonate that makes up the coral , and there 's a whole bunch of things we can do .
you can see there 's some signals there .
it has many consequences .
so , charlie veron came up with this statement last year : " the prospect of ocean acidification may well be the most serious of all of the predicted outcomes of anthropogenic co2 release . "
it wasn 't just a matter of tuning up some graphics routines .
the luminous room is a system in which it 's considered that input and output spaces are co-located .
and we make the machine meet them half way .
people still reference those sequences in " minority report " when they talk about new ui design .
let 's just come down a bit and fly around .
in the real world , we have people who collaborate ; we have people who have to work together , and we have many different displays .
and let 's just pick out a few elements .
ju : no , it has to be for every human being .
c 'mon , c 'mon . martial arts , games . c 'mon .
and he turned to my mother , and he said , " you haven 't told her yet ? "
no labels .
and then i was a masseuse . and then i was a landscape gardener .
but all that belief had fueled me so long .
and do you love what you do , caroline ? "
and i went on a run that i know so well .
and then i remember thinking about that eye specialist asking me , " what do you want to be ? what do you want to be ?
i 'm going to go across india on the back of an elephant .
and i set up kanchi , because my organization was always going to be named after my elephant , because disability is like the elephant in the room .
and if you truly believe -- and i mean believe from the bottom of your heart -- you can make change happen .
and they built beautiful cities all powered on that coal .
and before we know it , they send in the tanks and then send in the troops , and lots of people are dying , and it 's a very , very difficult situation .
you 're arab muslim living in iraq .
poverty , despair , struggle .
that 's odd .
you don 't want americans to die . protect our troops .
it 's a holy war against muslims .
these christians are nuts .
we don 't see it that way in the united states , but you see it that way .
she 's anybody to me .
put yourself in the shoes of the americans who caught them .
why would you use this example of all examples ? "
thank you .
what do we mean by beyond ourselves ?
and this directly translates into my paintings .
i can dodge what i don 't want and pull in what i want .
i was so inspired .
i 've come here to share with you an experiment of how to get rid of one form of human suffering .
a typical day at aravind , we would do about a thousand surgeries , maybe see about 6,000 patients , send out teams into the villages to examine , bring back patients , lots of telemedicine consultations , and , on top of that , do a lot of training , both for doctors and technicians who will become the future staff of aravind .
and yet , why should there be so much variation in quality and in service , and that was the fundamental principle that we followed when we designed the delivery systems .
and how much will they pay for this ?
and , of course , one needs the mindset to be wanting to give away what you have as a surplus .
so , i think it is simple to say just because the u.k. isn 't india the difference is happening .
the radio show is called " the infinite monkey cage . "
if the sun could one day -- and indeed the earth , in fact -- if the earth could read its own astrological , astronomical chart , one day it would say , " not a good day for making plans .
we are all totally recyclable .
that 's the wonderful thing about evolution -- the predilection to believe that our child is best .
i 'm sitting on a train .
you , i imagine , can do much better things with your time .
you can get on your kinect and you can have unicorns dancing and rainbows spraying out of your mobile phone .
it turned into a 24-hour contest .
somebody goes to another country , says , " how fascinating these people are , how interesting their tools are , how curious their culture is . "
and the problem is that a lot of people now , especially adolescents , have to go through two adolescences .
so i started studying anthropology .
they 're not just sitting there .
it wasn 't the resume of breaking this record here , it was more like , who had i become ?
it 's a smiling face .
and i gathered together , honestly , the world 's leading experts in every possible way .
and there 's nothing like swimming for 50 hours in the ocean that gets you thinking about things like this .
and every one of those barbs is sending that venom into this central nervous system .
it was like an icu unit in the water .
well there was no grin and bearing this .
i was swimming with this thing on .
thank you .
i didn 't quit the media lab ; i stepped down as chairman -- which was a kind of ridiculous title , but someone else has taken it on , and one of the things you can do as a professor , is you stay on as a professor .
it didn 't scale but it at least was bringing computers to developing countries , and learning pretty quickly that these kids -- even though english wasn 't their language , the latin alphabet barely was their language , but they could just swim like fish ; they could play these like pianos .
scale is truly important .
and the fun part -- and i 'm quite focused on it -- i tell people i used to be a light bulb , but now i 'm a laser -- i 'm just going to get that thing built , and it turns out it 's not so hard .
now this people ask all the time what it is .
this isn 't a design , ok ?
and yet we count .
you can spray paint it ; you can do anything you want .
so it 's not a matter of whether it 's going to happen . it is going to happen .
we 're told what to wear -- -- and how to do our hair -- -- and how to behave .
but i found my place .
thank you .
and it 's also something that resides in each of us , to close what i think are the two big calamities in the world today .
one of those businesses was a computer rental business called micros on the move , which is very well named , because people kept stealing the computers .
people today we call social entrepreneurs .
one of the lines of encouragement that i heard over and over was , " the streets of hollywood are littered with the carcasses of people like you , who think you 're going to come to this town and make movies . "
and so again , it goes back to betting on good people doing good things .
and we 're also doing a movie called " the kite runner , " based on the book " the kite runner , " also about afghanistan .
i think we have a situation here .
so if a novel can be put into six words and a whole memoir can be put into six words , you don 't need more than six words for a tedtalk .
so for $ 60 , i could summarize a thousand tedtalks into just 600 summaries , which would actually be quite nice .
it 's a huge list .
thank you very much .
in the last 30 years , thanks to explorations in remote parts of the world and advances in technology , biologists have , for example , added a full one-third of the known frog and other amphibian species , to bring the current total to 5,400 , and more continue to pour in .
and i 'd like to show it .
each is exquisitely adapted to the environment in which it lives , interlocked with other species to form ecosystems upon which our own lives depend in ways we have not begun even to imagine .
of the 15 percent evaluated , 20 percent are classified as " in peril , " that is , in danger of extinction .
today , the practicalities of making such an encyclopedia , regardless of the magnitude of the information put into it , are within reach .
that 's the unknown world , and today we 've only explored about 3 percent of what 's out there in the ocean .
disappears right into the background .
one , two , three .
this is a new generation , a new family , which is able to store the winds .
ok . good .
now , another couple of years , and these animals will survive on their own .
as the trevor project says , it gets better .
if you include internet telephony , you might be able to push this number up to six or seven percent , but it 's nowhere near what people tend to estimate .
okay .
so try this out with your friends and acquaintances , if you like . you 'll find that it 's very cool to talk about the world being one , etc .
think of france and the current debate about immigration .
you can do it immediately , right ?
she has left . no ! a big hand .
if a card shark gathers the cards together , immediately when he -- before he deals the card . now , so i think , number three , i have arranged them in a full house .
yes ?
this is a little risky .
yeah , last night i forgot that . that was a mistake .
but you know , i think you are familiar with fractals -- the mandelbrot spirals and all these things .
when i lift the heap , i peek .
excellent .
lg : queen of ? queen of hearts .
but you can relax , because it takes half an hour before it works , so you have plenty of time to see my whole performance .
i think there are lots of -- i don 't know how many -- but 10 , 15 spades in a deck , at least , right ?
yeah ? ok .
if i drop the card face up , like this , you reverse it . zoe : ok .
go ahead . yeah , good . i like the empathy .
maybe i 'll stand up . half .
ok , now .
if -- and then nine , right ?
ladies and gentlemen , lennart green ! lg : okay , thank you .
so now i 'm in a parking lot . basically it 's a tin can , and i 'm basically recreating the launch with fire extinguishers , fire , i have wax that i threw in front of the lens to look like ice , and so basically if you believed any of the stuff that i just showed you , what you were reacting to , what you 're emoting to , is something that 's a total falsehood , and i found that really kind of fascinating .
so i showed him this , and the reaction i got was interesting .
so , when you saw my footage , you were seeing this : basically , a bunch of guys flipping a ship upside down , and the little mir subs are actually about the size of small footballs , and shot in smoke .
it 's about how our brain is tricked into seeing a persistence of vision that creates a motion picture , and one of the things i had to do is , we — sasha baron cohen is a very clever , very smart guy , comedian , wanted to basically do an homage to the kind of the buster keaton sort of slapstick things , and he wanted his leg brace to get caught on a moving train .
and he said , " because no one knows you had anything to do with it . "
the only thing singing today would be the facts , for i have truly embraced by inner nerd .
the number of people living in back-breaking , soul-crushing extreme poverty has declined from 43 percent of the world 's population in 1990 to 33 percent by 2000 and then to 21 percent by 2010 .
for a start , you won 't have to listen to an insufferable little jumped-up jesus like myself .
right now today , in oslo as it happens , oil companies are fighting to keep secret their payments to governments for extracting oil in developing countries .
it 's not going to kill you .
but let 's , sort of , start at the beginning .
and then you 'll hear things like the train , a plane , a car -- so , the commute .
i did these conference calls . i did all this stuff .
there 's five of them , and in order to get to the really deep ones , the really meaningful ones , you have to go through the early ones .
we all have to improve on this sort of thing .
those are the real problems in the modern office today .
what if they 're thinking about something important ?
what can managers do -- enlightened managers , hopefully -- what can they do to make the office a better place for people to work , so it 's not the last resort , but it 's the first resort ?
so maybe it 's every other week , or every week , once a week , afternoons no one can talk to each other .
and i think it 'll all pay off in the end .
this is just a road . and it 's not very big : it 's about 250 meters on one side , 400 on the other .
there 's the nest entrance , there 's a pencil for scale .
when extra food becomes available -- and this is what everybody knows about picnics -- then extra ants are allocated to collect the food .
i don 't think that chamber has evolved because of me and my backhoe and my crew of students with pickaxes , but instead because when there 's flooding , occasionally the colony has to go down deep .
they have eyes , they can distinguish between light and dark , but they mostly work by smell .
so , if i change the numbers performing one task , it changes the numbers performing another .
and the amazing thing about this is that an ant lives only a year .
and we 've learned that , in this species -- and i suspect in others as well -- these hydrocarbons , this layer of grease on the outside of ants , is different as ants perform different tasks .
so , we do a lot of simulation and modeling , and also experimental work , to try to figure out how those two kinds of noise combine to , in the aggregate , produce the predictable behavior of ant colonies .
it 's ephemeral just like us . "
one is : if 80 to 90 percent of what we 're finding in the ocean -- of the marine debris that we 're finding in the ocean -- is plastic , then why don 't we call it what it is .
let 's talk about manias .
two billion of them .
jw : so is english mania good or bad ?
they said , " no , no , it 's too hot . they come out later . they 're smart . "
who would have thought ? oh my gosh .
a friend of mine explained to me , before the ' 79 revolution , it was two . after the revolution , three .
never " hi , jack . "
and i could sense that she thought i was speaking synecdochically .
use science to , you know , work backwards and say , " well , really , what were they thinking ? "
in fact , in many of the statues , when you excavate them , the backs are totally smooth -- almost glass smooth .
it has a lot of disadvantages : each one of these steps is extremely expensive , it 's potentially dangerous and they have the interesting property that the step cannot be performed in anyone 's backyard , which is a problem .
now , i 'm also very interested in cooking .
in fact , almost everybody in the movie is based on a real character , a real person .
it sounds really dumb , but that 's what it is .
so , the thing that 's wonderful for me about finding dinosaurs is that it is both an intellectual thing , because you 're trying to reconstruct the environment of millions of years ago .
it 's true .
basil jones : but actually we 're going to start this evolution with a hyena .
so we call this a piece of emotional engineering that uses up-to-the-minute 17th century technology -- to turn nouns into verbs .
and just around that time , his mother had said , " have you seen this book by michael morpurgo called ' war horse ' ? "
and we had a crate built for it .
there is very little 20th century technology in them .
the ears are obviously a very important emotional indicator of the horse .
ak : other emotional stuff .
the sound that that very large chest makes , of the horse -- the whinnying and the nickering and everything -- that starts usually with one performer , carries on with a second person and ends with a third .
and it has been the study of other religious traditions that brought me back to a sense of what religion can be , and actually enabled me to look at my own faith in a different light .
first propounded by confucius five centuries before christ : " do not do to others what you would not like them to do to you . "
and this , again -- this universal outreach -- is getting subdued in the strident use of religion -- abuse of religion -- for nefarious gains .
" do not do to others what you would not have them do to you " : an ethos that should now be applied globally .
it 's what is meant by overcoming the horror that we feel when we are under threat of our enemies , and beginning to appreciate the other .
and he said to the guy , " why have you put stuff on the back that no one will ever see ? "
i thought , well what the hell 's that about ?
i don 't know even if there is something called a conditioned reflex .
is it beautiful ? is it exciting ?
and one of the most common faces on something faced with beauty , something stupefyingly delicious , is what i call the omg .
very hard to find something that , to everybody , is a very beautiful thing , without a certain amount of information packed in there before .
and this is the f1 mv agusta .
and of course , a racing bike doesn 't have a prop stand , but this one , because it 's a road bike , it all goes away and it folds into this little gap .
pretty ? yes .
and they 're working in beauty in slightly different ways because of it .
well in this case it isn 't , because it 's a very , very ecologically-sound piece of technology .
form is function . form is function .
look at this , mom ! i made it !
i got way too much time on my hands .
now i did have an advantage .
as the koran promises , patience is rewarded , and there are many surprises -- a degree of environmental awareness , for instance , and of humans as mere stewards of god 's creation , unmatched in the bible .
there are no 72 virgins in the koran .
and the third is commitment .
or is it other countries ?
and they showed me a manual which actually was an excellent manual .
so i talked about the fact that we need to train and support defenders .
so i thank you for having the prophetic imagination to imagine the shaping of a new world with us together , and invite you into this journey with us .
the fundamental issue is that , for me , design is the first signal of human intentions .
so , as kevin kelly pointed out , there is no endgame .
and if we remember sheikh yamani when he formed opec , they asked him , " when will we see the end of the age of oil ? "
my childhood summers were in the puget sound of washington , among the first growth and big growth .
the book itself is a polymer . it is not a tree .
and we have plenty of energy , so we 'll solve that problem , but the biology problem 's tricky , because as we put through all these toxic materials that we disgorge , we will never be able to recover that .
technical nutrients -- this is for shaw carpet , infinitely reusable carpet .
and so i will finish by showing you a new city we 're designing for the chinese government .
we lay out the building areas .
who could blame them ?
the fact of the matter is that this has become a very poignant question because there is for the first time in a long time a real challenge to the western ideological systems of politics and economics , and this is a system that is embodied by china .
perhaps it 's no surprise that in a 2007 pew survey , when surveyed , africans in 10 countries said they thought that the chinese were doing amazing things to improve their livelihoods by wide margins , by as much as 98 percent .
but it also says that as china moves toward being the largest economy in the world , something that is expected to happen by experts in 2016 , that this schism between the political and economic ideologies of the west and the rest is likely to widen .
it put a man on the moon .
and that 's not to say i ever went on to become a brilliant , world-class neuropsychologist .
in fact , more than four million people sustain a concussion every year , and these data are just among kids under 14 who were seen in emergency rooms .
it requires only a change in consciousness , and that can be any one of a number of symptoms , including feeling foggy , feeling dizzy , hearing a ringing in your ear , being more impulsive or hostile than usual .
let me tell you what i 've come up with .
now i 'm not here to tell you what kind of legislation you should or shouldn 't support , but i am going to tell you that , if it matters to you , your legislators need to know that .
we only have whales in our waters today because of the save the whales movement of the ' 70s .
so over the 200 years of whaling , when we were busy killing and removing these carcasses from the oceans , we likely altered the rate and geographic distribution of these whale falls that would descend into deep oceans , and as a result , probably led to a number of extinctions of species that were most specialized and dependent on these carcasses for their survival .
so , this talk is going to be about how do we make things and what are the new ways that we 're going to make things in the future .
this is a pretty interesting trend , because we used to live in a world where everyone 's said glibly , " form follows function , " but i think i 've sort of grown up in a world -- you listened to neil gershenfeld yesterday ; i was in a lab associated with his -- where it 's really a world where information defines form and function .
because there are some advantages to inorganic systems , like higher speed semiconductors , etc .
so i was trying to , you know , take the engineer 's version : can we build a mechanical system in inorganic materials that will do the same thing ?
if it 's circular , you make a spherical lens .
just by thinking about the physics of the world , materials as the computer , you can start to do things like this .
i 've gone too far . so that sounds like it 's it .
so , the technology that i want to talk about is for the third world , for the developing world , but it has , i think , much broader application , because information is so important in the healthcare system .
the brown color indicates the amount of glucose in the urine , the blue color indicates the amount of protein in the urine .
those half of you , roughly , who are women , at some point may have had a pregnancy test .
and there is an example of the kind of thing that you see .
" have you taken if for a month ? " " yes . "
how do you get back an accurate view of the color on mars if you have a really terrible bandwidth to do it with ?
there 's the chip .
it measures the absorption of light in a sample the neat thing about this is , you have light source that flickers on and off at about 1,000 hertz , another light source that detects that light at 1,000 hertz , and so you can run this system in broad daylight .
they were not the only ones .
treatment programs became possible , funding became available , and the number of people on antiretroviral drugs started to increase very rapidly .
there 's something else that can really scare generic manufacturers away .
he has access to antiretroviral drugs .
and the idea there is that outside the spaceship , the universe is implacably hostile , and inside is all we have , all we depend on .
it 's so dark that if you were to be looking at the nearest star to you , and that star were to explode as a supernova , and you were to be staring directly at it at the moment when its light reached you , you still wouldn 't be able to see even a glimmer .
not just a superficial image of it , though it contains that as well , but an explanatory model , embodying the same mathematical relationships and the same causal structure .
and a million tons is enough to make , say , a self-contained space station , on which there 's a colony of scientists that are devoted to creating an open-ended stream of knowledge , and so on .
now i don 't think that probability is the right category to discuss this issue in .
it ought to be buzzing with plans to reduce the temperature , and with plans to live at the higher temperature -- and not at all costs , but efficiently and cheaply . and some such plans exist , things like swarms of mirrors in space to deflect the sunlight away , and encouraging aquatic organisms to eat more carbon dioxide .
we are running late .
it turns out that competition and winning is a universal human value .
and in the united states there is a state of the union address given by every president since 1790 .
and so , they had minimal technology , but they had some technology .
so , what technology brought , through the very simple tools like these stone tools here -- even something as small as this -- the early bands of humans were actually able to eliminate to extinction about 250 megafauna animals in north america when they first arrived 10,000 years ago .
so , humanity is our greatest invention .
one trend that we notice in all those things is that the amount of energy per gram per second that flows through this , is actually increasing .
at the same time , it wants to give us things , and what it gives us is basically progress .
and what i mean by that is that we find a new job for it .
even technology wants clean water .
it 's completely fucked up and can only be explained in song .
this song is called " fingertips . "
i want my million dollars .
so this is our largest airplane which we have , the airbus a380 , and it 's quite huge , so a lot of people fit in there and it 's technically completely different than the vision i 've shown to you .
my belief is that the airplane of the future will get its own consciousness .
and this is combined with a top-down approach , because what we are doing in our daily life is we train our muscles , we train our skeleton , and it 's getting stronger .
they then go on to create an event , and beyond that , a foundation to support that .
but there was nothing for this cause , so we married growing a mustache with prostate cancer , and then we created our tagline , which is , " changing the face of men 's health . "
so again we persisted , and foster 's brewing came to the party and gave us our first ever sponsorship , and that was enough for me to quit my job , i did consulting on the side .
but what i 'm really pleased to say is , in 2010 , movember became a truly global movement .
and he goes , " listen , i know it 's about men 's health , i know it 's about prostate cancer , but this is for breast cancer . "
we literally fund hundreds if not thousands of institutions and researchers around the world , and when we looked at this more recently , we realized there 's a real lack of collaboration going on even within institutions , let alone nationally , let alone globally , and this is not unique to prostate cancer . this is cancer research the world over .
yet , there is hope .
the desperate try to restore order and normality , and if we are not able to cut this circle of violence , it will be transferred to the next generation without a doubt .
this was our sign -- it 's hand-painted , and we had 45 all over kabul .
and doctors usually have three to six minutes for the patients , but now this will change .
i make my living from games . i 've been lucky enough to do this since i was 15 , which also qualifies as i 've never really had a real job .
and i was at a dinner . part of the job of it , when you 're a chair of a department , is to eat , and i did that very well , and so i 'm out at a dinner with this guy called zig jackson .
so she proceeded to tell me , and so any of you who are parents will recognize the bingo buzzwords here .
and i said , " yes . " and so she said , " so , if i came out of the woods " — this is her brother and sister — " if i came out of the woods , avalon and donovan might be gone . " " yes . "
i was crazy when i decided to start it , but i 'm in the middle of it now .
everyone says it couldn 't be done .
and then we talk about organic food .
we cannot believe that they have our best interests at heart .
and if that 's not enough , they 've gone on to say , most before they graduate high school .
well , this is the food i found 24 months ago .
we really need to change this whole paradigm with kids and food .
now i 'm in charge of all the cooking classes and all the gardening classes in our school district .
i work with kids a lot . these are kids i work with in harlem .
it 's going to take more money .
and just remember , at very least tacitly , this is what we 're teaching children as what they should be doing .
you know what ? we should be ashamed .
if you look at science on one hand , science is a very rational approach to its surroundings , whereas art on the other hand is usually an emotional approach to its surroundings .
ah , some of you have . excellent .
so that was the second project .
i could do it again to show it one more time , but some would argue that this is a complete waste of the whiskey , and that i should rather drink it .
we get far more questions right on i.q. tests than each succeeding generation back to the time that they were invented .
luria looked at people just before they entered the scientific age , and he found that these people were resistant to classifying the concrete world .
and luria said , " but what do my words imply ? "
you can 't do science without making it logically consistent .
compare the doctor in 1900 , who really had only a few tricks up his sleeve , with the modern general practitioner or specialist , with years of scientific training .
but he did have a sense that black people were inferior .
it must be that blacks are somehow tainted .
now , i should say one thing that 's very disheartening .
now , this is bernoulli 's gift . this is a direct quote .
that 's not a bad rule of thumb , except when it is .
indeed , this is kind of like the sesame street game of " which thing doesn 't belong ? " and you 're right to say it 's the swimming pool that doesn 't belong , because the swimming pool is the only thing on this slide that 's actually very dangerous .
now , you can see the odds of winning haven 't changed , but it 's now fantastically easy to imagine who 's going to win .
because they had the sense that declining wages are worse than rising wages , even when the total amount of wages is higher in the declining period . here 's another nice example .
what does the loss of 20 dollars along the way have to do ?
so i 'm telling you something you already knew : namely , that comparison changes the value of things .
but if you drove across town , you could get it for 30,900 .
the problem of shifting comparisons is even more difficult when these choices are arrayed over time .
comparison . troubling comparison . let me show you .
suddenly we have the dynamic inconsistency that puzzled us .
i tried to point out to them that terrorism was a name based on people 's psychological reaction to a set of events , and that if they were concerned about terrorism they might ask what causes terror and how can we stop people from being terrified , rather than -- not rather than , but in addition to stopping the atrocities that we 're all concerned about .
i mean , what would it take to persuade our culture to downplay it ?
we 've evolved to get all excited about these dramatic attacks . is that because in the past , in the ancient past , we just didn 't understand things like disease and systems that cause poverty and so forth , and so it made no sense for us as a species to put any energy into worrying about those things ?
and as a result , many people look at economists as stupid people .
once we have all the details of that imaginary scenario , suddenly we feel like it might be important to save so that that guy has a little retirement money .
but the man had somehow a lot of room at the bottom .
you could get a marilyn monroe sandwich .
well , what do you talk about when you talk about minds ?
i think it may have been a special rapport that he and i had .
he taught me all sorts of things about mechanical things .
feynman 's style -- no , style is not the right word .
the small number of simple principles were very , very simple .
this was the thing the feynman diagrams were for .
this was the key to analyzing these experiments .
but if we look within our societies , there are extraordinary social gradients in health running right across society .
where a country is is a sort of average score on these things .
it comes from the world values survey .
this is the proportion of the population in prison .
but there are endless problems with social gradients that are worse in more unequal countries -- not just a little bit worse , but anything from twice as common to 10 times as common .
and in a number of studies , it 's possible to compare how people do in more and less equal countries at each level in the social hierarchy .
and in the review , what they were interested in seeing is what kind of stresses most reliably raise levels of cortisol , the central stress hormone .
the big change in our understanding of drivers of chronic health in the rich developed world is how important chronic stress from social sources is affecting the immune system , the cardiovascular system .
clearly , we cannot continue on this path which puts the environment , public health , and food security at risk .
this takes millions of cells and expands them into billions .
it need not look like this , which is actually the state of the art today .
today we don 't need one million light bulbs to create a spherical display .
i 've got a little video to show you , but keep in mind that this is with no electronic control , and this is also with only four leds .
that 's why there 's a glass of water up there .
well the easy answer is , we just haven 't gotten those salts to those people .
massive technological advance : took an incredibly deadly disease , made it solvable .
see , when we were dealing with our biology , bacteria , the genes , the things inside here , the blood ?
i think there is something very profoundly right in what these women are doing .
this is easy , $ 1.10 .
audience : red . green .
but the truth of the matter is , you look at that car , it doesn 't look like a volvo , and it doesn 't look like a hummer .
okay , back to bmw . what should they do ?
maybe the last mile problem really should be thought of as the last mile opportunity .
this is about energy efficiency .
now , i think that we 're on the verge of something big .
we work closely with companies that have operational capacity , or nonprofits that have operational capacity .
but today we 're all creating this incredibly rich digital archive that 's going to live in the cloud indefinitely , years after we 're gone .
one service called my next tweet analyzes your entire twitter stream , everything you 've posted onto twitter , to make some predictions as to what you might say next .
now i started this from a point of view that it has to be something that scales en masse .
now it sounds crazy . but in some places around the world , like scandinavia , you already have that .
what we found out , when you move from molecules to electrons , something interesting happens .
20 miles per gallon that 's a buck 50 , a buck 60 a gallon .
so we went out , and we looked at all the car companies .
we then were sort of coined as the guys who run only in small islands .
and we keep getting wells that are farther away from the ground .
now we actually looked at what the answer would be .
we don 't have the industry set right .
and they said , " well you can dig . " and we decided to dig up , instead of digging down .
he actually shared with me another story , which is from about 200 years ago .
and i know what you 're thinking .
so we 're not forcing people to travel .
people were very upset , very angry that i was showing these dirty sides of cairo , and why didn 't i cut the dead donkey out of the frame ?
so i was thinking , you know , this station that 's hated by so many people has to be doing something right .
and then what hit me was , the night before , there had been some kind of bombing in basra , and al jazeera had shown images of the people .
and sameer , on the other hand , was also quite an interesting character for the arab world to see , because it brought out the complexities of this love / hate relationship that the arab world has with the west .
god forbid !
are you sure she is dead ? "
it 's about the liberation struggle .
you have towns and villages and theaters all from around the world getting together , and sitting in the dark , and sharing a communal experience of watching a film , or a couple of films , together .
so what we 'd like to call this day of film is pangea cinema day .
now , as many of you know , airbnb is a peer-to-peer marketplace that matches people who have space to rent with people who are looking for a place to stay in over 192 countries .
now , this little anecdote gets to the heart of why i 'm really passionate about collaborative consumption , and why , after i finished my book , i decided i 'm going to try and spread this into a global movement .
six months later , leah quit her job , and taskrabbit was born .
reputation is the measurement of how much a community trusts you .
it was ridiculous . i couldn 't get a mobile phone plan because my credit history didn 't travel with me .
a three-digit score , your traditional credit history , that only 30 percent of us actually know what it is , will no longer be the determining factor in how much things cost , what we can access , and , in many instances , limit what we can do in the world .
you know , there are only a few windows in history where the opportunity exists to reinvent part of how our socioeconomic system works .
by the way , it is a story that is told through its hard materials .
so again , i am a believer in the expressive .
so again i am a believer in the radical architecture .
too many buildings that you see outside that are so banal tell you a story , but the story is very short , which says , " we have no story to tell you . "
our emotions are complex .
create a space for an office , a space of sustainability that really works between that virtuality and yet can be realized as something real .
and often it takes just a building to change our experience of what could be done , what has been done , how the world has remained both in between stability and instability .
so again , i think the notion that the best architecture is silent has never appealed to me .
these are the spaces that are not just luxurious spaces for some of us , but are important for everybody in this world .
i think architecture is about consensus .
i am a cultural omnivore , one whose daily commute is made possible by attachment to an ipod -- an ipod that contains wagner and mozart , pop diva christina aguilera , country singer josh turner , gangsta rap artist kirk franklin , concerti , symphonies and more and more .
all of us are engaged in a seismic , fundamental realignment of culture and communications , a realignment that is shaking and decimating the newspaper industry , the magazine industry , the book and publishing industry and more .
this double impact is occasioning a massive redefinition of the cultural market , a time when anyone is a potential author .
especially now , as we all must confront the fallacy of a market-only orientation , uninformed by social conscience ; we must seize and celebrate the power of the arts to shape our individual and national characters , and especially characters of the young people , who all too often , are subjected to bombardment of sensation , rather than digested experience .
you know in 1950 the typical ship carried 5,000 to 10,000 tons worth of goods .
growth was negative .
common , the common -- i think that 's absolutely right , and why ? because there are more drugs to treat common diseases than there are to treat rare diseases .
globalize trade .
india is coming on line .
that 's not u.s. gdp per capita , which will be over a million , but world gdp per capita -- $ 200,000 .
oil . oil . this was a big topic .
when i was five years old i fell in love with airplanes .
and i decided i had to get closer than just drawing fantasy airplanes .
and he said , " well for one thing , there are more girls there . "
and i found that there were ways to duplicate the same approach that i used to use on the airplane .
i 'll tell you right up front , this is a trade off .
the other thing i felt was that armrests had never really been properly approached from the standpoint of how much of an aid they could be to your work life .
all the weight of your upper torso -- your arms , your head -- goes right down through your back , your spine , into those bones when you sit .
so that part of it took a long time to work out .
and this is a titan class ship in the space game , eve online .
and so these combine to form a very intense emotional engagement .
and the way they do this is through a combination of probability and data .
no , we want one or two monsters on the screen at any one time .
it 's already been done at the university of indiana in the states , among other places .
the 25 percent . this lights the brain up .
and in this video game , there were two really big dragons , and you had to team up to kill them -- 42 people , up to 42 to kill these big dragons .
and we can use the kind of group behaviors that we see evolving when people are at play together , these really quite unprecedentedly complex cooperative mechanisms .
so momentum is good . don 't stop .
it 's amazing . the best climbers are the ones that in the most extreme situations can get their bodies into some position where they can rest , regroup , calm themselves , focus , and keep going .
when i knew i was going to come to speak to you , i thought , " i gotta call my mother . "
he 's from florida .
and there 's stories you tell late at night to a friend , maybe once in your life .
i need to go to the mall , and you know your father now , he takes a nap in the afternoon , and i got to go .
of course , they have a carport .
" you coming ? you no coming ? "
it 'll help my breathing . it 'll do something for my pulse , maybe .
" no , i look up , and the light , she change . "
" no , no , no . the only thing with him is , he 's an idiot .
well , i stood up to her .
but this is my daughter , lauren , my remarkable daughter , my borderline asperger 's kid .
i think we all secretly love stories .
" ma , have you no shame ?
the boy , now , he says . " well , what my sister meant " -- they look at each other , it 's a knowing glance -- " god , she 's crazy ! "
and so some of the brains that i 've studied are people you know about .
because a daughter can get one x from the father , one x from the mother , it 's kind of diluted out .
now she blamed this on my father 's side , of course .
but our grandkids are going to be kind of concerned here .
in business , we give bonuses to people who are willing to sacrifice others so that we may gain .
whether it was the weather , lack of resources , maybe a saber-toothed tiger , all of these things working to reduce our lifespan .
i said , " why do you have treat us like cattle ?
in fact , if you have issues , they will coach you and they will give you support , just like we would with one of our children who happens to come home with a c from school .
and so they came up with a furlough program .
why would you give your blood and sweat and tears for that person ? " they all say the same thing : " because they would have done it for me . "
now , here come two more people , and immediately after , three more people .
it 's a piece of neural audio technology for rewiring other people 's minds .
why wouldn 't they just go to a shop and buy a bag of nuts that somebody else had already cracked open for them ?
we can then choose , from among a range of options , the best one .
and we really had only two options for dealing with the conflicts that visual theft would bring .
so what you do one day is you take a pile of arrowheads , and you walk up to the one that can 't speak very well , and you put the arrowheads down in front of him , hoping that he 'll get the idea that you want to trade your arrowheads for finished arrows .
language really is the voice of our genes .
okay , this tendency we have , this seemingly natural tendency we have , towards isolation , towards keeping to ourselves , crashes head first into our modern world .
there are lots and lots of ways of measuring things -- weighing them and measuring their length -- but the metric system is winning .
my work is about the behaviors that we all engage in unconsciously , on a collective level .
you can still see the little people way down there .
it reverberated around the world , and will continue to reverberate through time .
384,000 women , american women , last year went in for elective breast augmentation surgery .
that , to me , is the big question that we face as a people right now : how do we change ? how do we change as a culture , and how do we each individually take responsibility for the one piece of the solution that we are in charge of , and that is our own behavior ?
in the developing world , the data is much sketchier but the death toll is almost certainly higher .
until recently , we haven 't had to know exactly how a vaccine worked .
seth berkley : really cool video , isn 't it ?
it mutates furiously , it has decoys to evade the immune system , it attacks the very cells that are trying to fight it and it quickly hides itself in your genome .
the thai results tell us we can make an aids vaccine , and the antibody findings tell us how we might do that .
so far , animal tests indicate that such a vaccine could prevent severe disease , although you might get a mild case .
this year 's swine flu strain grew very poorly in early production : basically .6 doses per egg .
because these technologies are so efficient and relatively cheap , billions of people can have access to lifesaving vaccines if we can figure out how to deliver them .
so , if we can figure out how to do that , then we have the vaccine , and what 's interesting is there already is some evidence that we 're beginning to crack that problem .
and when you listen to some of the presentations here -- and the extraordinary range of human capability , our understandings -- and then you contrast it with the fact we still call this planet , " earth : " it 's pretty extraordinary -- we have one foot in the dark ages .
it turns out that something more than 94 percent of life on earth is aquatic .
a seat works in a two-dimensional world , where gravity blasts down on that seat , ok ?
she has twice the wingspan that i do .
it took 10 years to build .
and so what we needed to do was increase the wing area so that we just had more grip , develop higher forces .
i 'm talking to you about the worst form of human rights violation , the third-largest organized crime , a $ 10 billion industry .
and i tell you stories from there .
they are voiceless , [ unclear ] , nameless people .
i 've rescued children as young as three years , and i 've rescued women as old as 40 years .
my challenge has not been the traffickers who beat me up .
i 'm here as a voice of the victims and survivors of human trafficking .
my topic is economic growth in china and india .
so let me call it the shanghai model of economic growth , that emphasizes the following features for promoting economic development : infrastructures , airports , highways , bridges , things like that .
that 's not too good .
now let 's turn to two countries , country a and country b.
and then you draw the conclusion the odds of winning the lottery are 100 percent .
the adult literacy rate in china is 77 percent as compared with 48 percent in india .
so india is reverting to the normal .
they have increased the security of proprietors .
this is a very impressive record indeed .
so let 's first talk about focused ultrasound .
but ultrasound can be shaped to be anything in between , because it 's a mechanical force .
so he suffered from essential tremor for many years .
so he presses " sonicate , " and this is what happens .
this is an immediate relief .
let 's move now to a more painful subject .
and he has been very happy .
this will take two years .
reuters alone puts out three and a half million news stories a year .
we 're having trouble feeding six billion today .
the irony is , though , that we have cashed-out prosperity almost literally in terms of money and economic growth .
it 's a 130-fold improvement , and that is 10 times further and faster than anything we 've ever achieved in industrial history .
but the materiality matters too , because in every society that anthropologists have looked at , material stuff operates as a kind of language -- a language of goods , a symbolic language that we use to tell each other stories -- stories , for example , about how important we are .
is this really how economies behave ? "
these ones , interestingly , are 400 miles north of here outside barrow-in-furness in cumbria .
and it reveals to us , suddenly , the crux of the matter .
and what happened then was the sponsor gave revenues to ecosia , and ecosia is giving 80 percent of those revenues to a rainforest protection project .
it 's clear that we have a responsibility to help lift them out of poverty .
you 're not making news out of things falling down .
they belonged to boys .
you either go up , or you come down . "
because normally it was always said , power to detect , and that 's it , or power to punish .
they sent me to prison to lock me up , thinking , " now there will be no cars and no vips to be given tickets to .
it was one of the finest , largest volunteerism in any prison in the world .
and this is what transformed .
secondly is about the anti-corruption movement in india .
because out of the urban devastation in port-au-prince came a torrent of sms texts -- people crying for help , beseeching us for assistance , sharing data , offering support , looking for their loved ones .
it has been used to signal early warning in advance of weather-related disasters .
young people living in kibera in their community , with simple handheld devices , gps handheld devices and sms-enabled mobile phones , have literally put themselves on the map .
we are on a planet of seven billion people , five billion mobile subscriptions .
eric berlow : i 'm an ecologist , and sean 's a physicist , and we both study complex networks .
cameron russell talking about image and beauty connected over into europe .
and so there 's a lot of exciting stuff we can do here , and i 'll throw to eric for the next part .
and we could go back to those topics and say , well , what talks are central to those conversations ?
and it 's about our fixation with celebrity and celebrity culture , and the importance of the image : celebrity is born of photography .
and the camera can lie , and it makes it very , very easy with the mass bombardment of imagery to tell untruths .
i then started to work for magazines and newspapers .
how do we know when we 're looking at something whether it 's real or not ?
it 's obviously a very big commercial company , and so this little , " shh -- it 's not really them , " was put on the side of the imagery .
what jack nicholson might be up to in his celebrity life , and the fact that he tried to ... he had a bit of road rage and golf-clubbed a driver the other day .
and my mother was irish catholic , and -- but she didn 't take religion too seriously .
it wasn 't going anywhere toward , you know , saying what the gene was ; it was just nuclear science . and oh , that 's the book , little book .
he certainly wasn 't smiling when i got there , because he was somewhat humiliated by pauling getting the alpha helix , and the cambridge people failing because they weren 't chemists .
and so , one day peter came in and he said he was peter pauling , and he gave me a copy of his father 's manuscripts .
and it was because of a rule , which , to me , is a very good rule : never be the brightest person in a room , and we weren 't .
but , you know , we thought , well , it 's at least 95 percent right or 99 percent right .
rna provides the information for protein .
but wigler , besides looking at cancer cells , looked at normal cells , and made a really sort of surprising observation .
so what 's the meaning of the controls ?
well actually , i think the answer is staring us right in the face : use computers .
what is math ?
now it 's understandable that this has all got intertwined over hundreds of years .
and i 'll say , " hmm , not sure . " i 'll think about it roughly .
i think you need to separate the basics of what you 're trying to do from how it gets done and the machinery of how it gets done and automation allows you to make that separation .
might have been 50 years ago , but it isn 't anymore .
so if you go through lots of examples , you can get the answer , you can understand how the basics of the system work better .
why is this ?
now i 'm not for one minute suggesting it 's the only kind of question that should be asked in exams , but i think it 's a very important type that right now just gets completely ignored and is critical for people 's real understanding .
the bar is called the miracle of science .
now as i was training in clinical medicine and hematology and oncology and stem cell transplantation , what we had instead , cascading through the regulatory network at the fda , were these substances -- arsenic , thalidomide and this chemical derivative of nitrogen mustard gas .
and so we worked with samples of material that were collected by young pathologists at brigham women 's hospital .
we 've completed now clinical trials in four mouse models of this disease .
for all the reasons you see listed here , we think there 's a great opportunity for academic centers to participate in this earliest , conceptually-tricky and creative discipline of prototype drug discovery .
this research is funded by the public .
well it turns out that the secret was broccoli .
even more remarkably though , the fact that 15 month-olds didn 't do this suggests that these 18 month-olds had learned this deep , profound fact about human nature in the three months from when they were 15 months old .
so childhood is the reason why the crows end up on the cover of science and the chickens end up in the soup pot .
and then as adults , we can take all those things that we learned when we were babies and children and actually put them to work to do things out there in the world .
so i think those babies are actually making complicated calculations with conditional probabilities that they 're revising to figure out how the world works .
and the other interesting thing is that they 're using that evidence to get to an idea , get to a hypothesis about the world , that seems very unlikely to begin with .
oh .
and adults ' attention and consciousness look kind of like a spotlight .
now it 's good to be a grownup .
there is a picture of charles . so let 's watch the next clip .
but the thing about charles and ray is that they were always modeling stuff .
and i think that 's one of the commonalities between modernism and traditional design . i think it may be a real common ground as we kind of figure out what on earth to do in the next 20 or 30 years .
and they 'd been working on furniture before .
the " powers of ten " is a film they made .
and here is some family pictures .
dawn , very good .
and so we had spelling bees in paris , illinois .
and he made it for the 1939 faculty exhibition .
if you 're up the scale a little bit more , why , a brass thali .
i really thank you for your time .
and as they land , they 're fully aligned in the gravitational field .
and we 've stained these cultures with a green florescent dye so that we can look at these proteins that form these chains .
and the typical patient with optimal therapy survives just a little over a year , and only about seven months from the time that the cancer is first treated and then comes back and starts growing again .
a year after this treatment -- in fact , this is his baseline mri .
it 's still there .
and when we talked to her , she said that when she was undergoing chemotherapy , she had to go to the hospital every month for her infusions .
when he pushes his shoulders forward , he goes into a dive .
those sequences were shot over the last three years in various moments of your activities .
yr : it 's about 300 km per hour before looping .
so you have to adapt .
that 's the real important thing about safety .
people have died trying to do this kind of thing .
and then i stabilize , and according to my altitude , i continue on two or three engines .
i want to share it , to do formation flights .
" we spend billions of dollars trying to understand the origins of the universe while we still don 't understand the conditions for a stable society , a functioning economy , or peace . "
well , it turns out that what looks like complex behavior from the outside is actually the result of a few simple rules of interaction .
and we also assign a value to the company given by the operating revenue .
so you have a periphery and a center which contains about 75 percent of all the players , and in the center there 's this tiny but dominant core which is made up of highly interconnected companies .
let me explain by giving you this analogy .
but this journey has only just begun , so we will have to wait before we see the first results .
this is not a story of a nameless survivor of war , and nameless refugees , whose stereotypical images we see in our newspapers and our tv with tattered clothes , dirty face , scared eyes .
but i think the worst kind of fear is the fear -- as samia , a bosnian woman , once told me , who survived the four-years besiege of sarajevo ; she said , " the fear of losing the ' i ' in me , the fear of losing the ' i ' in me . "
it is a chess game .
we must have a full picture of what that means .
she learned about her rights .
thank you .
so to understand why this was the case , we took our data and put it into an ordination diagram , which is a statistical map that tells you something about how related the microbial communities are in the different samples .
it doesn 't matter whether you 're a basketball player , a tennis player , a gymnast or a bridge player .
consider the rankings for reading proficiency .
well , to find out , our foundation has been working with 3,000 teachers in districts across the country on a project called measures of effective teaching .
i think what video offers for us is a certain degree of reality .
diagnosing areas where a teacher needs to improve is only half the battle .
and in those 50 years , not only did we literally , physically set foot on the moon , but we have dispatched robotic spacecraft to all the planets -- all eight of them -- and we have landed on asteroids , we have rendezvoused with comets , and , at this point in time , we have a spacecraft on its way to pluto , the body formerly known as a planet .
and these molecules high up in the atmosphere of titan get broken down , and their products join together to make haze particles .
we have instruments on cassini which can see down to the surface through this atmosphere , and my camera system is one of them .
.
and obviously , it landed in one of these flat , dark regions and it didn 't sink out of sight . so it wasn 't fluid that we landed in .
but the mother lode of discoveries on enceladus was found at the south pole -- and we 're looking at the south pole here -- where we found this system of fractures .
but as if that weren 't brilliant enough , we can spot , in this beautiful image , sight of our own planet , cradled in the arms of saturn 's rings .
and if " where do you come from ? "
and nowadays , at least some of us can choose our sense of home , create our sense of community , fashion our sense of self , and in so doing maybe step a little beyond some of the black and white divisions of our grandparents ' age .
and the little girl who arises out of their union will of course be not korean or german or french or thai or scotch or canadian or even american , but a wonderful and constantly evolving mix of all those places .
he found himself .
and i started to go back to this place , and i noticed that i was doing my most important work there invisibly just by sitting still , and certainly coming to my most critical decisions the way i never could when i was racing from the last email to the next appointment .
chris kind of mentioned i started a company with my husband .
i am not that caring .
you 're just like your dad , " who " collects " instruments .
i wrote this one , and i put this up because of einstein today .
his baby is so small , and i 've never encountered such a just -- a disturbing image , but just -- just so heartfelt .
we have a successful company because of timing , and because of perseverance , but it 's simple stuff -- it 's not rocket science .
there was a joke , originally , about my graph that i left out , which is : you see all this math ? i 'm just happy i was able to add it up to 100 , because that 's my skill set .
and this was one of those instances where i realized how much blogging affects our relationship , and flattening this sort of world .
and love is not love , but being all shook up .
people with colored hearing actually see colors when they hear the sounds of words or letters .
if you 're like most people , you will experience a moment of cognitive dissonance when the name of the color is printed in a differently colored ink .
that 's a hypothetical example of course .
but before it was fossil poetry language was fossil metaphor .
change it ! come on ! what ?
that , of course , is the slavic swamp mermaid .
yeah , i 'm at the depressio , and i want to get over to amazonis so i plug it into the mars map , and click the button and there 's my directions .
it 's clear to me . "
" that 's wonderful eugene . you could make maps of toronto . "
here comes euler .
and judging from this , it looks a little like a cheeseburger .
once again , these guys rock it out .
descartes .
golden section , i 've been obsessed with this thing since before i was born .
the numbers from one to 36 , divided into six groups .
and i 'm presenting it here at ted . why ?
i look at the orbits of the planets .
well , i definitely think these goals are worth building on and seeing through , and here 's just a few reasons why .
i mean , wouldn 't it be a huge historic missed opportunity not to do this , given that we can ?
and look at the state of global politics today .
i mean , it dwarfs , dwarfs everything that is actually on our news agenda , and it 's invisible .
as chris said , i grew up in nigeria with a whole generation -- in the ' 80s -- of students who were protesting a military dictatorship , which has finally ended .
and chad says , " sure , like , we have this , like , salmon , that 's , like , rolled in this , like , wasabi , like , crust .
all through that one year , my mother never cried one time , not once .
men were taught to be men in the ways in which we are not women , that 's essentially what it is .
so , i was born two days after christmas .
it 's incredible .
there are some of you in this room , amazing people , who offer all of us the mirror to our own humanity .
about a half million people visit every day . but this isn 't about reddit .
which is pretty impressive right ? we won ! mister splashy pants was chosen . hmm , just kidding . okay .
greenpeace was thrilled . the whales were happy . that 's a quote .
and i actually feel at home here , because there 's a lot of autism genetics here .
in the early ' 70s when i started , i got right down in the chutes to see what cattle were seeing .
and they come up one at a time , and then i think , " ok , well maybe we can have it snow , or we can have a thunderstorm , " and i can hold it there and turn them into videos .
and there i got a gigantic one , and the control over there , the blue one , has got a really small one .
now , visual thinking gave me a whole lot of insight into the animal mind .
i find a lot of people have difficulty doing that .
and one of the things that is driving me really crazy , as i travel around and i do autism meetings , is i 'm seeing a lot of smart , geeky , nerdy kids , and they just aren 't very social , and nobody 's working on developing their interest in something like science .
we 've got to show these kids interesting stuff .
let 's figure out how long it takes a racecar to go a certain distance .
and you get him turned on , then he 'll learn all the new stuff .
you know , the thing is , autism comes in different degrees .
tg : well the reason why i got really excited when i read about that , it contains knowledge .
you can literally see them .
let 's take a look .
but april isn 't a particularly massive month for video games .
i 'll take answers .
i 've never studied art or anything .
it 's unconscious .
who has the biggest budget as a proportion of gdp ?
there 's always conflicting evidence .
now this app is spawning itself from the data .
i mean , i find information just too interesting .
if you look at the scene , egypt , for 30 years , had been in a downhill -- going into a downhill .
there are lots of people who actually share the same dream .
and everyone started to think that " this guy could be my brother . "
but did the regime learn anything ? not really .
i was detained for 12 days , blindfolded , handcuffed .
we 're going to win because we don 't play their dirty games .
but rather all of these different practices -- you know , the ancient swamis and rabbis and priests and monks and nuns didn 't develop these techniques to just manage stress or lower your blood pressure , unclog your arteries , even though it can do all those things .
this is not unusual , and it 's part of what enables people to maintain these kinds of changes , because it makes such a big difference in their quality of life .
well , because it helps them get through the day .
when you eat a big fatty meal , how do you feel ?
so you can eat the same amount of food , but you 'll be getting fewer calories because the food is less dense in calories .
now , the problem with the atkins diet , everybody knows people who have lost weight on it , but you can lose weight on amphetamines , you know , and fen-phen .
we took 90 men who had biopsy-proven prostate cancer and who had elected , for reasons unrelated to the study , not to have surgery .
and it 's in a sense the most selfish thing that we can do .
take , for example , this beautiful blue nacre shell .
we have cells there , typically from the patient .
and we simplified it a lot , so we got rid of a lot of these steps .
and so you do get these kinds of contacts , and of course , being british and also growing up in france , i tend to be very blunt , and so i had to explain to them very nicely that in their particular case , there probably wasn 't that much in there to protect in the first place .
and there 's a lot of work going on in both of these areas .
if you have money , of course , you can get the value .
but i was about to leave the school , because my poor mother couldn 't afford schooling .
it is one lakh , 100,000 rupees , and you are to make it within that . "
seeking solutions for non-auto sectors .
the driver 's name is naran .
a challenge , of course .
let 's move on to something else .
let 's start in the spirit of more from less and more for more and start putting some targets .
you can see before treatment and after treatment .
the ideas have to be such that you think in completely different terms .
[ in the ] 20th century , we gave gandhi to the world .
when the paper burned , for some reason he turned to me , and he said , " mashelkar , like this , if you do not diffuse your energies , if you focus your energies , you can achieve anything in the world . "

you have to say , " sam dined , " not , " sam dined the pizza . "
well , in both cases , the thing that is construed as being affected is expressed as the direct object , the noun after the verb .
it evokes the container metaphor of communication , in which we conceive of ideas as objects , sentences as containers , and communication as a kind of sending .
for example , in polite requests , if someone says , " if you could pass the guacamole , that would be awesome , " we know exactly what he means , even though that 's a rather bizarre concept being expressed .
in dating , the transition from friendship to sex can lead to , notoriously , various forms of awkwardness , and as can sex in the workplace , in which we call the conflict between a dominant and a sexual relationship " sexual harassment . "
so this is a rather fraught situation .
bluefin are in cave paintings in france .
these animals and their demise occurs in the tuna fisheries .
now , i 've been working with tunas for over 15 years .
that 's the closest you 'll probably ever get .
both the electronic tags i 'm talking about are expensive .
that is where the tuna spawn .
salmon sharks aren 't the only sharks we tag .
same thing with laysan albatross who travel an entire ocean on a trip sometimes , up to the same zone the tunas use .
but maybe mission blue can fill in that ocean that we can 't see .
because traditional economic theory would say , well , the mountain bike was probably invented by some big bike corporation that had a big r & amp ; d lab where they were thinking up new projects , and it came out of there . it didn 't come from there .
what 's the policy recommendation out of that if you 're in government , or you 're running a large company ?
the truth is that most creativity is cumulative and collaborative ; like wikipedia , it develops over a long period of time .
largely through globalization , a lot of this equipment has got a lot cheaper .
these people over there will do everything they can to stop these kinds of organizations succeeding , because they 're threatened by them .
that 's not their role ; they 're supposed to read what we write .
i was in shanghai , in an office block built on what was a rice paddy five years ago -- one of the 2,500 skyscrapers they 've built in shanghai in the last 10 years .
every morning , there are 600 people queuing outside their offices to reclaim these characters .
certainly , 10,000 years ago , the civilization 's beginning , the human portion was less than one tenth of one percent . let 's look at it now .
your great-great grandparents got by on muscle power , and yet we all think there 's this huge power that 's essential for our lifestyle . and with all the wonderful technology we have we can do things that are much more efficient : conserve , recycle , etc .
buckminster fuller said it clearly : " there are no passengers on spaceship earth , only crew . we , the crew , can and must do more with less -- much less . "
can you bring up the house lights ?
it hit the building . and the building was poorly placed , actually .
and if we can get some agreement on where we want the world to be -- desirable , sustainable when your kids reach your age -- i think we actually can reach it . now , i said this was a warning , not a forecast . that was before -- i painted this before we started in on making robotic versions of hawk moths and cockroaches , and now i 'm beginning to wonder seriously -- was this more of a forecast than i wanted ?
you read about it in your newspapers .
that 's right , older people are happy .
how frustrated are you right now ? -- so that we could get a sense of the kinds of emotions and feelings they were having in their day-to-day lives .
but that 's not the case .
what will happen to societies that are top-heavy with older people ?
since then , we 've doubled the number of roads in america , and we now spend one fifth of our income on transportation .
but actually , they 're spending most of it in their homes , and home investment is about as local an investment as you can get .
in san diego , they used walk score -- walk score rates every address in america and soon the world in terms of how walkable it is -- they used walk score to designate more walkable neighborhoods and less walkable neighborhoods .
new york city .
there are only so many people in this country at any given time , and we can choose to live where perhaps we would have a lighter impact .
but what if lifestyle was really about quality of life and about perhaps something that we would all enjoy more , something that would be better than what we have right now ?
i 'll try to spin a story about energy , and oil 's a convenient starting place .
now , it 's about 35 percent .
it 's about 400 million years old .
how the molecules are put together .
areca palm is a plant which removes co2 and converts it into oxygen .
40 percent of the world 's energy is taken up by buildings currently , and 60 percent of the world 's population will be living in buildings in cities with a population of over one million in the next 15 years .
" i 'm trying to go places . "
can you say ' i will kill you in the name of allah ? ' " " i could say that , but what if i were to say , ' hello . i 'm your doctor ? ' " they go , " great . and then you hijack the hospital . "
" i didn 't get the memo . what 's going on ? "
for example , dubai -- cool place .
and when you put your two year-old on a slide in the united states , they put something on the slide to slow the kid down as he comes down the slide .
he goes , " i thought you were my driver . "
but he actually talks to , has two-way exchanges with , about four to six people on a regular base , depending on his gender .
and i heard this story the first time a couple of years ago from a very modest family of immigrants from kosovo in switzerland .
and this has become such a norm of our professional lives , such a norm and such an expectation .
so the lower the status of the job and of the person carrying out , the more removed he would be from his personal sphere .
i know that seems ludicrous .
we 're going to do this one more time .
you should be immune .
yep , this cancer is your wakeup call . "
meaning can be quiet and introverted .
it 's never too late to become someone other than simply a survivor .
and at that point , her two daughters got up and said , " we 're going to go get coffee . "
we have to let that crucified self die so that a new self , a truer self , is born .
so i 've decided to recruit some of my ted friends to read my words aloud for me .
there was no particular day when anyone told me i would never speak again ; it just sort of became obvious .
does that create a separation or a distance from one person to the next ?
these are a few of the comments i recorded for use when chaz and i appeared on the oprah winfrey program .
the flow isn 't natural .
the initials stood for programmed logic for automated teaching operations .
it is unimaginable what will happen next .
ironic that my legs are fine , and it 's my shoulders that slow up my walk .
all of these people are saying , in one way or another , that what you see is not all you get .
okay , just a moment .
and the way we 'll make energy in the future is not from resource , it 's really from knowledge .
so , uranium , which is very big , wants to split .
well , there is a trickiness that you have to make it 150 million degrees , but there is a trickiness about the reaction yet .
the big thing , on the right , is the lithium we have in the world .
we 've got to take that , we 've got to make that into a fusion reactor .
but this is what we 're aiming at , sometime in the 2030s -- real electric power from fusion . thank you very much .
but you know what ?
these laws ensure that people living with hiv and those at greatest risk are protected from violence and discrimination and that they get access to prevention and to treatment .
hilma : i found out when i went to the hospital for a pregnancy check-up .
now there are still many problems .
australia and switzerland were two countries which introduced harm reduction very early on in their hiv epidemics , and they have a very low rate of hiv among injecting drug users .
but awareness needs action .
and so three days later , driving very fast , i found myself stalking a single type of giant cloud called the super cell , capable of producing grapefruit-size hail and spectacular tornadoes , although only two percent actually do .
and a lot of times that 's what people think i do , and it 's the furthest thing from it . what happens , though , is people say to me , " i don 't need any motivation . "
because that 's what i got hired to do .
so , the question we 've got to ask ourselves really is , what is it ?
and you correct me if i 'm wrong .
is this the end or the beginning ? is god punishing me or rewarding me , or is this the roll of the dice ?
we all have had time .
let me tell you what they are . first one : certainty .
zero to 10 . how high ? 10 . how certain am i that you 're going to respond to me ? 10 . how much uncertainty ?
because we all know , corny as it sounds , the secret to living is giving . we all know life 's not about me ; it 's about we . this culture knows that . this room knows that .
so , finally -- and i 'm about out of time -- the target that shapes you -- here 's what 's different about people . we have the same needs , but are you a certainty freak ? is that what you value most , or uncertainty ? this man here couldn 't be a certainty freak if he climbed through those caves . are you driven by significance or love ? we all need all six , but whatever your lead system is , tilts you in a different direction .
he said , " i don 't know how to tell you this , but you gave me the greatest gift because i 'm going to die . "
that 's a bit lofty ; i 'm really more of something like a street walker .
and so i look at this bike as not being a designer bike , but being a very good example of design .
it takes your attention ; it has a great amount of emotion ; it stares back at you the way that a figure might .
and this is a great protection of a pedestrian zone , and the repurposing of some colonial cannons to do that .
i was at the art show in miami in december , and spent a couple of hours looking at fine art , and amazed at the prices of art and how expensive it is , but having a great time looking at it .
and the idea that a city group can maintain different types of foliage is really quite exceptional .
we just got a grant from the gordon and betty moore foundation to sequence 130 genomes this year , as a side project from environmental organisms .
some of these make logical sense , in terms of different temperature gradients .
but it has roughly 500 genes .
and i think it 's important to keep reality in mind , versus what happens with people 's imaginations .
it 's truly stunning that these organisms can do that , and we probably have thousands , if not tens of thousands , of different species on this planet that are capable of doing that .
every major religion participated in this .
and since we know where their heads are , and we have a wireless mic on them that we 're processing the sound from , we 're able to create visualizations which are linked very tightly to what they 're doing with their speech .
and definitely my life has been part of that .
and then this led to broader ideas of buildings that come together through the multiplicity of systems .
and then the broader ideas of city-making start having direct influences on architecture , on the elements that make up the broader scheme , the buildings themselves , and start guiding us .
and then , again , the building itself , middle of los angeles , right across from city hall .
there 's some air conditioning left in the base , but the skin now moves on hydraulics .
and , of course , we 're interested in participating with education .
and the building is no longer seen as an autonomous thing , but something that 's only inextricably connected to this city and this place at this time .
and then of course , this one , our governor at the moment .
the end of the 19th century , beginning of the 20th century , and how that hanging chain model translates into archways and vaulting .
so , in architecture we deal with big assemblies of components , so there might be up to , say , 50,000 pieces of material in this room you 're sitting in right now that all need to get organized .
it turns out it 's not rocket science to design a sacred space .
now , as an architect , part-to-whole relationships is all i think about , but in terms of product design it 's becoming more and more of an issue for companies .
and you can see that that change in massing also gives all 48 of the apartments a unique shape and size , but always within a , kind of , controlled limit , an envelope of change .
and i only have 15 minutes , and i see they 're counting already .
and they also decided that i had to -- to give me a very ugly plexiglas trophy for it .
is a remnant of a race of -- a very evolved race of entertainers .
i had a chance to go to florence , in -- i think it was ' 94 , and i saw ghiberti 's " door of paradise . "
this is " 6,500 yards , " after corot . " 9,000 yards , " after gerhard richter .
and i picked minimalist pieces because they 're about specificity .
and at the same time , i was doing these very large constructions , being 150 meters away .
well , i think that 's it .
and that same year , 10 years ago , i headed north to the phoenix islands .
but tell me where they are and the country that owns them . "
you can see the fish are balled up and then there 's a little cloudy area there where they 're exchanging the eggs and sperm for reproduction -- events that the ocean is supposed to do , but struggles to do in many places now because of human activity .
and when i was first going up there , i barely knew the name of this country 10 years ago , and people would ask me , " why are you going to this place called kiribati ? "
but if you come , you have to buy lunch for everybody who comes to the seminar . "
i went back to the states and started looking around to see if i could find examples where reverse fishing licenses had been issued , and it turned out there were none .
it was over 32 degrees celsius for six months and it basically killed 60 percent of the coral .
you can read them yourselves .
and the question is , who do you want to remember -- if you had just 45 minutes with your grandmother ?
our latest engagement is the cleveland museum of art , which we 've created an engagement called gallery one for .
so the memorial opened in 2011 , and the museum 's going to open next year in 2014 .
voice 3 : sur les champs-élysées , à paris . voice 4 : in college , at u.c. berkeley .
and we ask them questions that are actually not really answerable , the types of questions that 9 / 11 itself draws forth for all of us .
so suddenly what is this undifferentiated , anonymous group of names springs into reality as an individual life .
you 'll expand your vocabulary , meet new people , and you 'll have a healthier lifestyle .
and while i 'm okay now , i wouldn 't wish this gift for you .
the story that we 're told is that there was a " light footprint " initially -- in other words , that we ended up in a situation where we didn 't have enough troops , we didn 't have enough resources , that afghans were frustrated -- they felt there wasn 't enough progress and economic development and security , and therefore the taliban came back -- that we responded in 2005 and 2006 with troop deployments , but we still didn 't put enough troops on the ground .
within a few months , there were two and a half million more girls in school .
now this is not to say afghanistan is a place full of people like mullah mustafa .
or in 2008 , major general champoux to come in and say he would deliver the " decisive year . "
when they go out , they travel in these curious armored vehicles with these somewhat threatening security teams who ready 24 hours in advance who say you can only stay on the ground for an hour .
this has been done by an incredible , principled effort by the international community , and , of course , above all , by bosnians themselves .
it 's about context .
and we are always being tempted up to our neck .
and after hundreds of conversations with teenagers and teachers and parents and employers and schools from paraguay to australia , and looking at some of the academic research , which showed the importance of what 's now called non-cognitive skills -- the skills of motivation , resilience -- and that these are as important as the cognitive skills -- formal academic skills -- we came up with an answer , a very simple answer in a way , which we called the studio school .
and next year , we 're expecting about 35 schools open across england , and another 40 areas want to have their own schools opening -- a pretty rapid spread of this idea .
none , huh ?
they went out and gathered them up .
and so every time they found something that looked a little different , they named it something different .
but cutting into the bones of a dinosaur is hard to do , as you can imagine , because in museums bones are precious .
so here are 12 dinosaurs .
but if you line them up , if you just take those three skulls and just line them up , they line up like this .
and before the year 2000 -- now remember , triceratops was first found in the 1800s -- before 2000 , no one had ever seen a juvenile triceratops .
it 's a big skull .
the bone histology tells us that edmontosaurus is a juvenile , or at least a sub-adult , and the other one is an adult and we have an ontogeny .
that 's a good number to go extinct , i think .
what happens ? it rings .
today , i 'm going to talk to you about sketching electronics .
and so sometime soon , you 'll be able to play and build and sketch with electronics in this fundamentally new way .
try to spot the beehive . it 's there .
furthermore , they also produce more honey .
1971 , we saw it spread to europe and south america , and then , when we get to the 1980s , and specifically to 1987 , the varroa mite finally came to north america and to the united states , and that is when the game changed for honeybees in the united states .
bring them to areas where they 're thriving and try to make them healthier before they get sick .
their clients aren 't happy , and people go hungry .
and so it is with archimedes , the great greek mathematician .
and it became a world famous manuscript .
and if you look at this photograph carefully , the bottom half of this is rather brown .
so what we did was we processed the images together , and we put two images into one blank screen .
and as it disappears , an electron from a shell farther out jumps in and takes its place .
and this didn 't exist in codices a and b.
they won enumerable victories , but no one remembers what they are because they were all fought for selfish ends .
and if you want to look at medieval manuscripts on the web , at the moment you have to go to the national library of y 's site or the university library of x 's site , which is about the most boring way in which you can deal with digital data .
and i think that institutions should stand up and release all their data under unrestricted licenses , and it would be a great benefit to everybody .
i have no doubt about it .
it 's an evolving artwork , evolving architecture .
so we 're trying to redefine how we look at our future in outer space by exploring integration , biology , technology and people ; by using a cocreation approach ; and by using and exploring local traditions and to see how we can learn from the past and integrate that into our deep future .
for the past five years , i 've been taking my wife and kids to southwestern montana , where i worked as a teenager on the hay harvest . and montana , at first sight , seems like the most pristine environment in the united states .
how could the easter islanders have deforested their environment ?
that means that those of us in this room who are less than 50 or 60 years old will see how these paradoxes are resolved , and those of us who are over the age of 60 may not see the resolution , but our children and grandchildren certainly will .
there 's been a lot of folklore developed around the ocean , mostly negative .
so if you ever fantasize about going back in time and seeing what a dinosaur looked like , that 's what a dinosaur looks like .
it 's not an animal we draw cartoons of or draw at all .
he 's a great white shark .
but it was a chance for me to introduce readers to a lot of crazy undersea characters .
the third storyline i did about a year and a half ago was probably my most difficult .
meanwhile , ernest finds his fins on the internet .
so you get this sense of urgency , like you need to find as much stuff as possible as soon as possible .
there is going to be no turning back .
i 'll now proceed quickly , and before else , to a subject that is both a vital asset and a potential barrier to a scientific career .
ideas emerge when a part of the real or imagined world is studied for its own sake .
once you have settled on a specialty , and the profession you can love , and you 've secured opportunity , your potential to succeed will be greatly enhanced if you study it enough to become an expert .
you 'll find your own way to discover , to learn , to teach .
they were just there , but they had no significance .
well , a year later i returned , and using the same protocols and recording under the same conditions , i recorded a number of examples of the same dawn choruses , and now this is what we 've got .
mono lake is just to the east of yosemite national park in california , and it 's a favorite habitat of these toads , and it 's also favored by u.s. navy jet pilots , who train in their fighters flying them at speeds exceeding 1,100 kilometers an hour and altitudes only a couple hundred meters above ground level of the mono basin , very fast , very low , and so loud that the anthrophony , the human noise , even though it 's six and a half kilometers from the frog pond you just heard a second ago , it masked the sound of the chorusing toads .
and our ears tell us that the whisper of every leaf and creature speaks to the natural sources of our lives , which indeed may hold the secrets of love for all things , especially our own humanity , and the last word goes to a jaguar from the amazon .
the next work is a sound-sensitive installation that we affectionately call " the pygmies . "
and we made them react to people , but we found that people were being quite playful and childlike with them .
his head is so heavy , full of heavy thoughts , that it 's sort of fallen into his hat , and his body 's grown out of him almost like a plant .
so this is the last work , and a work in progress , and it 's called " space filler . "
among the reasons i think it 's happening right now is the quality of the leadership across africa .
and they 're investing in energy .
would you set up a factory in sub-sahara in the mid-1970s ?
in ghana in the elections , in december 2012 , the battle between the two candidates was over education .
but what i 'm saying here is that we can make a difference and we can do that by investing .
and then something happened in 1980 .
no , not right now , just 30 seconds .
and so that 's a big part of why we 've chosen the free licensing model , because that empowers local entrepreneurs -- or anyone who wants to , can take our content and do anything they like with it -- you can copy it , redistribute it and you can do it commercially or non-commercially .
it 's a very unusual and chaotic thing .
the reporters called me up and they -- i mean , i have to say they spelled my name right , but they really wanted to say , the bush-kerry election is so contentious , it 's tearing apart the wikipedia community . and so they quote me as saying , " they 're the most contentious in the history of wikipedia . "
the reason for this is if we say we 're only going to write the " truth " about some topic , that doesn 't do us a damn bit of good of figuring out what to write , because i don 't agree with you about what 's the truth .
so chris was able to do his change -- he didn 't have to log in or anything ; he just went on the website and made a change .
so , i mentioned earlier , people type asdfasdf -- it needs to be deleted . cases like that , the administrators just delete it .
down here at the bottom , " keep , real movie , " rick kay .
but there is a need still for a certain amount of monarchy , a certain amount of -- sometimes we have to make a decision , and we don 't want to get bogged down too heavily in formal decision-making processes .
jimmy wales : yeah , so , a lot of teachers are beginning to use wikipedia .
i 'm going to ignore their cautions and make one very specific forecast .
now , when i talk about this with my friends in cambridge and silicon valley , they say , " fantastic . no more drudgery , no more toil .
so this is clearly bad news for reuther .
but as the social researcher charles murray has documented , as we started to automate the economy , and 1960 is just about when computers started to be used by businesses , as we started to progressively inject technology and automation and digital stuff into the economy , the fortunes of bill and ted diverged a lot .
so the economic playbook is actually pretty straightforward .
but i actually don 't think that 's what we 're going to do .
when you meet them , they lock into you , they look you in the eye , they invade your personal space , they massage the back of your head .
and if you 're not talking about the individual relationship between a teacher and a student , you 're not talking about that reality .
in one of my books , i joke that ben & amp ; jerry 's should make a pacifist toothpaste -- doesn 't kill germs , just asks them to leave .
and far from being a coldly materialistic view of nature , it 's a new humanism , it 's a new enchantment .
it was just sheer terror .
the first gift , or talent , is mindsight -- the ability to enter into other people 's minds and learn what they have to offer .
this is a gender-linked trait , by the way .
but this is the source of innovation .
and now as we confront that shallowness and the failures that derive from our inability to get the depths of who we are , comes this revolution in consciousness -- these people in so many fields exploring the depth of our nature and coming away with this enchanted , this new humanism .
not one .
you need the time to get to know the people that you 're serving .
the emergency room ascertained that the kid had no alcohol in his blood .
regulate , regulate , regulate .
and they prevent disaster .
they thought it would reduce their property values .
a few sources of hope : we ought to try to re-moralize work .
one was ray anderson , who turned -- -- turned , you know , a part of the evil empire into a zero-footprint , or almost zero-footprint business .
if you run an organization , you should be sure that none of the jobs -- none of the jobs -- have job descriptions like the job descriptions of the janitors .
and i think he was right .
now , you can see united states , in 1983 , had a very low percentage infected , but due to the big population , still a sizable bubble .
and it has -- the steady state is , more or less , one percent of the adult world population is hiv-infected .
and you 'll find madagascar , and you 'll find a lot of african countries about as low as the rest of the world .
so , this is the difference within tanzania .
but , there is one part of africa -- and the difficult thing is , at the same time , not to make a uniform statement about africa , not to come to simple ideas of why it is like this , on one hand .
and what makes me so happy is that we are moving now towards fact when we look at this .
who would you rather be treated by ?
this guy decided he would go down to the amazon and give it a whirl , or give it a lick , and he did , and he wrote , " my blood pressure went through the roof , i lost full control of my bodily functions , i passed out in a heap , i woke up in a hammock six hours later , felt like god for two days . "
the rainforest has been called the greatest expression of life on earth .
a specimen from here in brazil tipped the scale at 201 pounds .
they have chosen to remain isolated , and i think it is their human right to remain so .
it is a treasure trove of botanical diversity .
there 's increased hunting and fishing for commercial purposes .
this is the perfect marriage of ancient shamanic wisdom and 21st century technology .
let 's live on a planet full of luxuriant vegetation , in which isolated peoples can remain in isolation , can maintain that mystery and that knowledge if they so choose .
but we also , in that period of time , added two more members to the nuclear club : pakistan and north korea .
this was basically an attempt to teach our schoolchildren that if we did get engaged in a nuclear confrontation and atomic war , then we wanted our school children to kind of basically duck and cover .
the idea was that we would force the soviets to re-target their nuclear weapons -- very expensive -- and potentially double their arsenal , to not only take out the original site , but take out sites where people were going .
first thing is that the global nuclear weapons , in the stockpiles that i showed you in those original maps , happen to be not uniformly secure .
there 's an unbelievable amount of know-how out there .
what you saw after katrina is a very good indicator of how little prepared the united states is for any kind of major attack .
there 's still enough nuclear weapons in the arsenals of the superpowers to destroy the earth many , many times over .
so if there 's any way that you can avoid , like , avert your eyes , that would be a good thing .
you say " nuclear " to them , and they 're thinking , " oh my god , we 're all gone . what 's the point ? it 's futile . "
and then you want to stay in shelter for 48 to 72 hours minimum , but you 're going to wait hopefully -- you 'll have your little wind-up , battery-less radio , and you 'll be waiting for people to tell you when it 's safe to go outside . that 's what you need to do .
it 's called the quadro 2000 dowser rod .
so that 's just a fun little example here of the sorts of things we do .
and part of that -- the same theme is expressed nicely here in this sidney harris cartoon .
on a more serious note , in all of science we 're looking for a balance between data and theory .
if you squint , you can still see the face .
but who does it really look like , the virgin mary ?
here 's the forward version of the very famous song .
and so , he wrote an op-ed piece in " the guardian " about katie 's song , in which he said , well , we know exactly how old , how far from the edge .
you couldn 't satisfy this guy .
" i don 't like to see animals suffer -- even in cartoons . "
the average cartoonist who stays with the magazine does 10 or 15 ideas every week .
now that 's not a cartoon . it requires thinking on the part of the cartoonist and thinking on your part to make it into a cartoon .
in here , you have the propriety of the new yorker and the vulgarity of the language .
for god 's sake no , a thousand times no .
" i 'm thinking about having a child . "
one way to look at it is this .
or there was another cartoon i didn 't show because actually i thought maybe people would be offended .
the target is the readership and the people who do it .
the dog is signaling he wants to go for a walk .
let me share with you today an original discovery .
lynn verinsky , a professional climber , who appeared to be brimming with confidence .
oh . one thing i want to point out is , look at stickybot .
my colleagues actually went on to test this limitation , by increasing the moment of inertia of a student , so they had a tail , and running them through and obstacle course , and found a decrement in performance , like you 'd predict .
and they get to the top and let 's say there 's some leaves there .
and it works just like it does in the animal .
and it certainly looks like it .
and here is the first active tail , in the robot , made by boston dynamics .
thus the title " silent spring . "
can we put this off till 2020 , 2030 , 2050 ? "
now i 'm not going to belabor this point , but studies do show that , as investors , women are much less prone to taking reckless risks than men , precisely because , as we 've already heard , women tend not to suffer from overconfidence in the same way that men do .
because this is our real master-narrative : however much we mess up , there will always be more -- more water , more land , more untapped resources .
this assessment , unfortunately , is far too optimistic .
it is terrestrial skinning .
a new frontier has been found .
i 'm not engaged in predicting random number generators .
if you 're trying to influence corporations to change their behavior , with regard to producing pollutants , one approach , the common approach , is to exhort them to be better , to explain to them what damage they 're doing to the planet .
five factorial is 120 .
that is , how willing are they to drop what they 're doing when the issue comes up , and attend to it instead of something else that 's on their plate -- how big a deal is it to them ?
what 's its future ?
and that is that iran will achieve that nationalist pride by making enough weapons-grade fuel , through research , so that they could show that they know how to make weapons-grade fuel , but not enough to actually build a bomb .
and if you engineer what they do you can change the world , you can get a better result .
and i can see their point , because i started my career as a theoretical nuclear physicist .
can 't you apply a definition , like for example , a supreme court-like definition of life ? "
well how would you go about it ?
why ? because these things don 't evolve by themselves .
and as you see here , there are groups that are growing on top of each other , because they are spreading .
and i would like to do it in such a way that i don 't actually have to be able to read the language , because i 'm sure i won 't be able to .
what you find is mostly glycine and then alanine and there 's some trace elements of the other ones .
and so now we can see , is that really a robust signature ?
and then that signature is lost .
and i can tell you , our agenda is full .
after 9 / 11 , either you were with us or against us .
now four com isaf 's later , we hear a different message : " this cannot be won militarily .
it 's hard , but it is necessary .
because they may turn out to be a majority .
so he engaged a political process of dialogue , not as a strategy of the weak , but as a strategy of the strong .
and they brought their knowledge .
our modern western societies are more complex than before , in this time of migration .
so i started wondering , with all of these overlaps , how was it that i had never thought to ask a veterinarian , or consult the veterinary literature , for insights into one of my human patients ?
around the year 2000 , human cardiologists " discovered " emotionally induced heart failure .
well , despite all of this promise , unfortunately the gulf between our fields remains large .
people thought about , " oh , my god .
well , the problem with being poor is you don 't have those choices .
and say , " what would you like to do next ? "
but if you create a world where you don 't trash people , you can 't trash the planet .
there 's no poison . there 's no pollution .
we are passionate about rescuing some dead materials from the landfill , but sometimes not as passionate about rescuing living beings , living people .
and my little idea that will do that is sleep .
and we 've had far too many icebergs hitting our titanics .
open-ended , open hearth , open source , open door policy , open bar .
i had to learn the language .
and he says , " well i used to be a banker and now i 'm a gold miner . "
he helped us understand that social media 's becoming social production .
and we need a lot of sunlight in this troubled world .
now , the fourth meaning of openness , and corresponding principle , is about empowerment .
up until two years ago , all revolutions in human history had a leadership , and when the old regime fell , the leadership and the organization would take power .
the creation of a corporation , science , the university , eventually the industrial revolution , and it was all good .
well , the murmuration functions to record a number of principles , and they 're basically the principles that i have described to you today .
yeah ! i already have fibonacci fans here .
suppose you wanted to look at adding the squares of the first few fibonacci numbers .
just as we created it .
sorry about that . i 've just given you a shot of cortisol , your fight / flight hormone .
if you have to work in an open-plan office like this , your productivity is greatly reduced .
just a word on music . music is the most powerful sound there is , often inappropriately deployed .
that 's an order of magnitude , up or down .
she 's 37 years old , she hasn 't won a marathon of any kind in eight years , and a few months previously she almost died in childbirth .
she loses the check , but she goes home with something bigger and more important .
well , there are teams of scientists at harvard and the university of utah that are bending their brains to try to figure out what the tarahumara have known forever .
i could throw a rock and hit a high school boy who can run faster than 4 : 15 .
and you 'll get slower and slower , until eventually you 're back to running the same speed you were at age 19 .
we could run really far on a hot day .
it 's a really compelling argument that maybe the tarahumara are doing exactly what all of us had done for two million years , that it 's us in modern times who have sort of gone off the path .
we are here today . we have our digital technology .
i was injured all my life , and then in my early 40s i got rid of my shoes and my running ailments have gone away too .
but of course , we 've spread to every corner of the globe and in arctic canada , where i live , we have perpetual daylight in summer and 24 hours of darkness in winter .
well my personal story , my personal journey , what brings me to the ted stage here today , is a demonstration of exactly what 's been happening in muslim-majority countries over the course of the last decades , at least , and beyond .
i was , by the way -- i 'm an essex lad , born and raised in essex in the u.k.
and the consequences that this is having is that it 's affecting the political climate across europe .
again with the example of the far right : that we find , ironically , xenophobic nationalists are utilizing the benefits of globalization .
there are no ideas and narratives and leaders and symbols advocating the democratic culture on the ground .
so roughly these four reasons make it a lot more difficult for democratic culture to spread as a civilizational choice , not merely as a political choice .
without freedom of belief , you don 't have the right to join organizations .
but that will require helping these societies transition from having merely political coalitions to building genuinely grassroots-based social movements that advocate for the democratic culture .
and this then has given rise to unprecedented and unexpected moral controversy .
in 1988 , at the university of minnesota , i participated in a small series of whole organ pancreas transplants .
and in our lab , we are focused on taking fat and reprogramming mounds of fat into fountains of youthful cells -- cells that we may use to then form other , more specialized , cells , which one day may be used as cell transplants .
heart disease is the leading cause of death worldwide .
america was jolted by the anti-vietnam movement , the civil rights movement .
it was a very small village -- a weekly bazaar where people , just once in a week , they put in all the vats .
give it a little push -- this becomes a rhombus .
this makes an igloo .
now this is what you do , is you bend both these legs into a triangle , and you just wrap some tape around .
if you take a smaller paper , you make a smaller flexagon .
and this costs very little money to make -- great fun for children to do .
there are six layers -- three layers of plastic , aluminum -- which are are sealed together .
wool sticks on velcro .
and they 'd be absolutely joyous playing with this .
and the third day , it would be a shikari cap -- just like an adventurer 's cap .
i 'm obsessed with insects , particularly insect flight .
what 's clever is the way the fly flaps it , which of course ultimately is controlled by the nervous system , and this is what enables flies to perform these remarkable aerial maneuvers .
now several people at this conference have already suggested that fruit flies could serve neuroscience because they 're a simple model of brain function .
a mouse has about 1,000 times as many neurons as a fly .
how small can neurons get ? well , look at this interesting insect .
you heard about neuromodulators earlier .
so for the first time we 've actually been able to record from neurons in the fly 's brain while the fly is performing sophisticated behaviors such as flight .
and i had an experience that really deepened and elucidated for me the understanding that i have .
she got married when she was 18 , had a baby right away .
jamii bora understands that and understands that when we 're talking about poverty , we 've got to look at people all along the economic spectrum .
because when systems are broken , like the ones that we 're seeing around the world , it 's an opportunity for invention and for innovation .
and of course , who could escape the irony of a member of rupert murdoch 's news corp.
and i sort of get it .
but interestingly , anonymous does not make use of its hacked information for financial gain .
and after that , it just went wild .
then we have renukanth subramaniam , aka jilsi -- founder of darkmarket , born in colombo , sri lanka .
he impressed in the private sector , developing chemical applications for the oil industry while simultaneously running a worldwide bank and credit card fraud operation that was worth millions until his arrest in 2008 .
thank you very much for listening .
so i set up a scientific criteria as to what a sensor would have to look like in order to effectively diagnose pancreatic cancer .
and so then , i was sitting in class , and suddenly it hit me : i could combine what i was reading about , carbon nanotubes , with what i was supposed to be thinking about , antibodies .
as you can never say no to a kid .
so if a 15-year-old who didn 't even know what a pancreas was could find a new way to detect pancreatic cancer , just imagine what you could do .
its creator , who is an egyptian tv producer called ahmed abu haïba , wants young people to be inspired by islam to lead better lives .
and by this time next year , the likes of superman and wonder woman will have joined forces with " the 99 " to beat injustice wherever they find it .
because there isn 't going to be a lot of money to improve public services , or to improve government , or to improve so many of the things that politicians talk about .
couldn 't actually turn back very much , because if you were king a thousand years ago , while it still took hours and hours and weeks and weeks to traverse your own country , there wasn 't much you were in charge of .
and this is so obvious , in a way , because you think about how all of you have changed the way we shop , the way we travel , the way that business is done .
you can see what crime is committed where , and you have the opportunity to hold your police force to account .
so what does all this add up to ?
for myself , of course , i have to completely trust my body language .
now a fundamental and really viscerally important experience for me , in terms of music , has been my adventures in south africa , the most dizzyingly musical country on the planet in my view , but a country which , through its musical culture , has taught me one fundamental lesson : that through music making can come deep levels of fundamental life-giving trust .
south africans just make music really freely .
t , see it 's the same as f in music .
t , e , d.
i 'm going to show you a clip now of the very first improvisation session that we had .
now my parting shot comes courtesy of the great joseph haydn , wonderful austrian composer in the second half of the 18th century -- spent the bulk of his life in the employ of prince nikolaus esterhazy , along with his orchestra .
and after that will bounced around from one family member to another , until , by the time he was nine years old , he was essentially living on his own .
and so inevitably , lawyers drifted to cases that were already in chapter four -- that makes sense , of course . those are the cases that are most urgent ; those are the guys who are closest to being executed .
and they went from chapter four 25 years ago to chapter three in the late 1980s .
we have to say , all right .
we could be providing early childhood care for economically disadvantaged and otherwise troubled kids , and we could be doing it for free .
he used to say , " well , you can pay me now or you can pay me later . "
if we make the picture bigger and devote our attention to the earlier chapters , then we 're never going to write the first sentence that begins the death penalty story .
but i suspected there was something really important about this whole feminism thing , so i started covertly tiptoeing into my mom 's bookshelves and picking books off and reading them -- never , of course , admitting that i was doing so .
i co-edit , along with a collective of other super-smart , amazing women , a site called feministing.com.
the mainstream media often paints my generation as apathetic , and i think it 's much more accurate to say we are deeply overwhelmed .
instead , what she really wanted to do was make films .
so often , particularly at a young age , we look far afield for our models of the meaningful life , and sometimes they 're in our own kitchens , talking on the phone , making us dinner , doing all that keeps the world going around and around .
hazrat ali : they first call us to the mosque and preach to us .
their parents are so poor , they have no resources to get them back .
but only if i get permission from my dad .
so it is a one-company town .
and he looked at his daughters , and he puts his hand on his chest , and he says , " so , gov , tell me , who is ever going to hire me ?
because after all , if you look at the context , 1.6 trillion dollars has been invested in the past eight years from the private sector globally , and every dollar represents a job , and where are those jobs going ?
you might look at michigan and say , we 're going to lead the nation in producing the guts for the electric vehicle , like the lithium ion battery .
thank you all so much .
north americans , such as myself , you know , we 're basically sort of wallowing , gluttonous hogs , and we 're eating all sorts of stuff .
we don 't know yet how to build a society which is environmentally sustainable , which is shareable with everybody on the planet , which promotes stability and democracy and human rights , and which is achievable in the time-frame necessary to make it through the challenges we face .
you leave aside what is natural to be natural .
we could just re-label things .
most of those cites are growing incredibly quickly .
this is a pretty remarkable program using free and open source software , cheap , sort of hacked-together machines , and basically sort of abandoned buildings -- has put together a bunch of community centers where people can come in , get high-speed internet access , learn computer programming skills for free .
and sort of the big motto of the anti-globalization movement . right ?
you get , for example , green power spread throughout the world .
this is one of my favorite worldchanging kinds of things ever .
and i think that we will .
that 's because she dances .
but i 'm still suggesting you and i should meet .
maybe you could have focused on cooking . how about french cooking ? "
last year saw 997 billion dollars in corporate fraud alone in the united states .
now granted , many of those are white lies .
it 's part of our culture , it 's part of our history .
by the time we enter this work world and we 're breadwinners , we enter a world that is just cluttered with spam , fake digital friends , partisan media , ingenious identity thieves , world-class ponzi schemers , a deception epidemic -- in short , what one author calls a post-truth society .
well first we heard what 's known as a non-contracted denial .
we think warmth and smiles convey honesty , sincerity .
that person may be withdrawn , look down , lower their voice , pause , be kind of herky-jerky .
there 're going to be times when someone makes one expression while masking another that just kind of leaks through in a flash .
they 're red flags .
pm : now i 'm going to show you a video of an actual grieving mother , erin runnion , confronting her daughter 's murderer and torturer in court .
when you combine the science of recognizing deception with the art of looking , listening , you exempt yourself from collaborating in a lie .
you 're afraid if you look for your passion and don 't find it , you 'll feel like you 're an idiot , so then you make excuses about why you 're not going to look for your passion .
mommy and daddy told me that if i worked hard , i 'd have a good career . so , if you work hard and have a good career , if you work really , really , really hard , you 'll have a great career . doesn 't that , like , mathematically make sense ? "
passion is your greatest love .
but what that tombstone should have said , in an alternative lifetime , what it should have said if it was your highest expression of talent , was , " here lies the last nobel laureate in physics , who formulated the grand unified field theory and demonstrated the practicality of warp drive . "
you know what will happen someday , you , you ideal parent , you ?
you could have said , looked the kid in the face , and said , " go for it , kid , just like i did . "
it can be a very complicated thing , the ocean .
now , when an ecologist looks at the ocean -- i have to tell you -- we look at the ocean in a very different way , and we see different things than when a regular person looks at the ocean because when an ecologist looks at the ocean , we see all those interconnections .
and that 's the difference between a pcb and , say , something natural like an omega-3 , something we want out of the marine food chain .
and we also are eating meat that comes from some of these same places .
but at least it 's labeled correctly , and you 're no longer going to be buying toxic dolphin meat instead .
not very often . we wouldn 't tolerate that .
we have major problems in disrupted ecosystem flow that the pyramid may not be working so well , that the flow from the base up into it is being blocked and clogged .
that change in thinking has led to a dramatic shift , not only in the fortunes of monterey bay , but other places around the world .
and now , four large panels : this is upper left ; upper right ; lower left ; lower right .
i thought that something would come out of it , like " words rule fantastic new old first last pope " because it 's by alexander pope , but i sort of made a mess out of it , and then i thought i 'd repeat it in some way so it was legible .
and one day i woke up and i said , " well , suppose that 's not true ? "
actually , i realize fear of embarrassment drives me as much as any ambition .
and another piece for the art directors ' club is " anna rees " casting long shadows .
but what really happens is that you read it as : " art is whatever remains . "
actually , you are .
maybe they exaggerated their style because they thought that they were not considered to be quite civilized , and they transferred that generational attitude or anxiety onto us , the next generation , so much so that when i was growing up , if ever on the television news or radio a report came up about a black person committing some crime — a mugging , a murder , a burglary — we winced along with our parents , because they were letting the side down .
they determined that they would send me to a private school , but my father worked at vauxhall motors .
it was left to my mother to educate me , and as george lamming would say , it was my mother who fathered me .
bageye was stung by what he perceived to be the public airing of his shortcomings .
in that first reunion , it was very awkward and tense moments , and to lessen the tension , we decided to go for a walk .
when we finally got out the back door , transformers were burning in the street .
co : yeah , and we need a hotline . can you make a google voice number ?
mo : we didn 't get our authority from the board of selectmen or the emergency management director or the united way .
co : the timing .
if we can get the right tools at the right time to the people who will inevitably step up and start putting their communities back together , we can create new standards in disaster recovery .
there are over three volunteer groups working almost every day , and have been since june 1st of last year , to make sure that these residents get what they need and get back in their homes .
and if you think about claims about the nonexistence of things , one obvious way to try and establish the nonexistence of a purported thing would be to offer a definition of that thing and then to see whether anything satisfied it .
he often jokes that he 's one of the world 's leading atheists .
a very specific thing happened .
it would take a long while to explain how a soul could be the kind of thing that could be washed , but rattray knew that this was religion because souls were in play .
so what i want you to think about next time somebody wants to make some vast generalization about religion is that maybe there isn 't such a thing as a religion , such a thing as religion , and that therefore what they say cannot possibly be true .
now , you had a lot of power , and you got to beat people up -- you got a lot of prestige , a lot of respect .
and for the worse -- not for the better , but for the worse .
big man , and he had hair , in his words , " down to his ass . "
makes you wonder about academics , ok ?
and they made them available to us .
these are the teenagers , typically , who 'd be standing out on the street corner , selling the drugs .
truly , you would be a great success story .
that 's extremely high .
so everybody got stuck at that $ 3.50-an-hour job , and it turned out to be a disaster .
it 's why we think garbage men might be paid more than people who work in parks , ok ?
so one thing we observed in the data is that it looked like , in terms of ...
i was doing some shopping beforehand .
they have fancy models of attention , posner 's trinity model of attention .
so if i come down , i 'm going to do a little bit of shopping .
come on up joe . let 's play a game .
joe : very . ar : good .
do you remember what it was ?
so -- -- that 's rather strange . they have shots for that .
like i said , it shapes your reality .
and then odysseus says , " i see that you can get it .
but then there 's this other self , the future self .
i was creating commitment devices of my own long before i knew what they were .
so i don 't like the way that they take the power away from you .
so what can we do about this ?
at the end , there will only be one marker left standing and it will determine our wealth in retirement .
as he moves his savings rate down , it means that he 's saving zero when it 's all the way here at the left .
your decisions today are going to determine its well-being .
so the global economy is becoming a place where women are more successful than men , believe it or not , and these economic changes are starting to rapidly affect our culture -- what our romantic comedies look like , what our marriages look like , what our dating lives look like , and our new set of superheroes .
and i realized that two things were different this time around .
and basically what you 'll see is what economists talk about as the polarization of the economy .
what the economy requires now is a whole different set of skills .
they 're used to thinking of themselves as providers , and they can 't seem to build the social networks that allow them to get through college .
but these college girls had a completely different view of their future .
it 's happening all over the world .
and then here 's a shocker : even america 's most sexiest man alive , the sexiest man alive gets romantically played these days in a movie .
you can bring your husband along .
lots of laughter , quite a bit of embarrassment .
and so , that decision to work with his friends -- now he has 550 of them -- was what got ideo started .
now , what i 'm going to do is , i 'm going to see how -- i can 't see out of these , ok .
all right , good .
kids are more engaged with open possibilities .
okay . put down your pencils , as they say .
it 's the plant from which you can create mescaline , one of the psychedelic drugs .
and somehow that seems wrong .
it 's classically learning by doing .
they lose this stuff that facilitates this sort of playful and building mode of thinking .
because when children play a role , they actually follow social scripts quite closely that they 've learnt from us as adults .
so when a kid dresses up as a firefighter , you know , he 's beginning to try on that identity .
as a result , we 'd all feel perfectly secure and have a good time -- but because we all understood the rules and we agreed on them together .
thank you very much .
he explained to them that it was not a question of survival of the fittest ; it was a question of understanding what they needed to survive and to protect that .
it 's a future we don 't know the details of , but it 's a future that has signs , just like benki saw the signs around him .
it 's imperative to me , when i look around the world , that we need to change ourselves .
literature makes one sensitive , sensitive to people , to their dreams and to their ideas . "
she would look at you and very quietly , very softly say , " it just happened .
two of the most sensitive buildings include a lifetime of collection about the cultural revolution , a period that actually most chinese would prefer to forget .
we can 't wait for the next generation , the new joiners , to come in and learn how to be the good leaders we need .
to conquer uncertainty , to know what comes next , that 's almost been the dominant aim of industrialized societies , and having got there , or almost got there , we have just encountered a new set of unmet needs .
much more significantly , they radically changed the behavior of the deer .
so the wolves , small in number , transformed not just the ecosystem of the yellowstone national park , this huge area of land , but also its physical geography .
it doesn 't try to produce a heath or a meadow or a rain forest or a kelp garden or a coral reef .
why is it that they can withstand the loss of so much of their bark ?
i get sick . you get sick .
but people volunteered for this .
it cannot be used by people who aren 't credentialed .
two hundred and twenty-six billion a year is spent on cancer in the united states .
as you can see , i have high cholesterol .
so that 's what i do . i 've actually started what we think is the world 's first fully digital , fully self-contributed , unlimited in scope , global in participation , ethically approved clinical research study where you contribute the data .
but it 's a challenge that i hope you 'll take , and maybe you 'll share it . maybe you won 't .
and they brought this kind of a jeweled parasol , and they put it on the ground .
and everyone here is unfortunately carrying that habitual perception , a little bit , right ?
you know , we really learned everything in the ' 60s .
so i said , " well , you know , you 're all in this yourself . you teach : it 's generosity , " was all i could think of . what is virtue ?
so the first person who gets happy , when you stop focusing on the self-centered situation of , how happy am i , where you 're always dissatisfied -- as mick jagger told us . you never get any satisfaction that way .
i 've been following this change for quite a while now , and participating in it .
now , all of these big things for love -- experiments -- aren 't going to take off .
now , imagine for a second these first three types of experiments : mass collaboration , online marketplaces , aggregated giving .
and everywhere i go , including here at ted , i feel that there is a new moral hunger that is growing .
and they were great community leaders .
whether this is a personal decision -- whether you 're going to install a burglar alarm in your home -- or a national decision -- where you 're going to invade some foreign country -- you 're going to trade off something , either money or time , convenience , capabilities , maybe fundamental liberties .
and if you think about it , the rabbits that are good at making that trade-off will tend to live and reproduce , and the rabbits that are bad at it will get eaten or starve .
third , personified risks are perceived to be greater than anonymous risks -- so bin laden is scarier because he has a name .
so one half , one quarter , one fifth -- we 're good at that .
now we all know the crime rate in our neighborhood , because we live there , and we get a feeling about it that basically matches reality .
you don 't need a model .
think of models of terrorism , child kidnapping , airline safety , car safety .
so as your model is close to reality , and it converges with feelings , you often don 't know it 's there .
and you see agenda -- this is marketing , this is politics -- trying to convince you to have one model versus another , trying to convince you to ignore a model and trust your feelings , marginalizing people with models you don 't like .
we can often do until our kids grow up .
now , what we want is people to get familiar enough with better models -- have it reflected in their feelings -- to allow them to make security trade-offs .
there were a couple of copycat attacks .
it 's important that , if our feelings match reality , we make better security trade-offs .
summertime and the living is easy fish are jumping and the cotton is high oh , your daddy 's rich and your ma is good-looking so hush little baby don 't you cry and i opened my eyes , and i saw that she had her eyes closed .
so i would like to share this piece with you .
and that 's named after the guy who recognized why it was such an important radius .
i need to understand the mass of the object i 'm claiming is a black hole , and what its schwarzschild radius is .
i like to call these the prima donna of the galaxy world , because they are kind of show offs .
and that is because we live in a galaxy which has a flattened , disk-like structure .
but it turns out these telescopes , or any telescope on the ground has had a little bit of a challenge living up to this campaign promise .
so , we 've been doing this experiment for 15 years , and we see the stars go all the way around .
and the truth is , i 'm not quite there .
so , what do we see ?
so , in conclusion , i 'm going to show you an animation that basically shows you how these orbits have been moving , in three dimensions .
this is the ancestor of cattle .
today 's religions are brilliantly designed -- brilliantly designed .
democracy depends on informed consent .
but now i 'm going to move on .
but it was a very clever move .
the design is there in nature , but it 's not in anybody 's head .
we heard about the atmosphere as a thin layer of varnish .
in other words , we have these hijackers -- you 've seen this slide before , from four years ago -- a parasite that infects the brain and induces even suicidal behavior on behalf of a cause other than one 's own genetic fitness .
and what i want to do now is say a bit about this book from the design standpoint , because i think it 's actually a brilliant book .
excellent insights into human psychology , wise advice on every page .
that 's worth mentioning .
and you can 't tell .
well maybe , ok , but what 's going to follow from this ?
it simply shows the religions of the world .
well , many biologists will tell engineers , and others , organisms have millions of years to get it right ; they 're spectacular ; they can do everything wonderfully well .
well , a human , one of your legs works like two legs of a trotting dog , or works like three legs , together as one , of a trotting insect , or four legs as one of a trotting crab .
so it 's a very different design . however , what 's changing , what 's really exciting -- and i 'll show you some of that next -- is that as human technology takes on more of the characteristics of nature , then nature really can become a much more useful teacher .
well , we wanted to see if they allowed the animals to have greater stability and maneuverability .
another reason why animals have extraordinary performance , and can go anywhere , is because they have an effective interaction with the environment . the animal i 'm going to show you , that we studied to look at this , is the gecko .
it 's a see-through treadmill with a see-through treadmill belt , so we can watch the animal 's feet , and videotape them through the treadmill belt , to see how they move .
we were fortunate to work with another group at stanford that built us a special manned sensor , that we were able to measure the force of an individual hair .
where 's this going ? i think you can see it already .
in my life , when i tried to achieve things like success or recognition , they eluded me .
in the midst of incredible poverty and loss , people who had nothing absolved a man who had taken everything from them .
this contingent seems to be quite lucky , and it has not sustained any casualties , even though dozens of peacekeepers have been killed in liberia .
now , hundreds of homes were destroyed .
focus on what 's dignified , courageous and beautiful , and it grows . thank you .
but you 'll notice something else , and that 's that the face of the sun has freckles .
in gando , there was no electricity , no access to clean drinking water , and no school .
i even asked my classmates to spend less money on coffee and cigarettes , but to sponsor my school project .
don 't forget , it can be 45 degrees in burkina faso , so with simple ventilation , i wanted to make the classroom good for teaching and learning .
we wanted to use them to create openings .
we just wait for the rain to go .
she just answered , " they are contributing to pay for your education hoping that you will be successful and one day come back and help improve the quality of life of the community . "
put it back .
and let me show you what happened .
and we need to learn that principle here in the states , because we have a big debt .
my father found that in a junkyard , and was able to repair it and make it work . and somehow -- to this day , i frankly don 't know how he was so aware of what was going on in the world -- but , by inviting me to sit down with him when i was only a few years old , and playing records in this victrola by mozart , and he would tell me how mozart was the most romantic of all the classic composers ever , and how claire de lune , which was one of his favorites , was a real exposure to me to classical music .
what we believe is that the internet , frankly , is a connection of people and ideas .
it is impossible , even in the united states , for that cost , to be able to enable the connectivity that we 're all trying to reach .
and it has to be based on a geo-sensitive approach .
we just recently opened a learning laboratory in a school in the west cape in south africa , in a school that 's called nelson mandela school , and when you see the faces and activities of these children being able to access computers , it 's just phenomenal .
and one of the things that i learned , too , from my parents -- and i 'll give you a little anecdote -- especially from my father .
and yet , i don 't really think it is because when it comes down to it , it 's this larger trajectory that is really what is going to remain -- what people in the future are going to remember about this period .
you just have to look at the human genome project .
it 's going to change the way we manage and alter our emotions .
and it 's going to be used for diet as well , and nutritional supplements and such .
the second is modifying our emotions .
but there are more important things that are already occurring : embryo screening .
it is being funded very very -- in a big way .
other people are going to say , " this is great .
they 're going to do like everybody does . they are going to forget about all that stuff .
we are , definitely .
first , it 's a new fear of intimacy .
drugs , you want more of the same -- different .
he started showing the symptoms about 12 years ago , and he was officially diagnosed in 2005 .
let 's start with the hobbies . when you get dementia , it gets harder and harder to enjoy yourself .
a lot of people don 't know that alzheimer 's actually has physical symptoms , as well as cognitive symptoms . you lose your sense of balance , you get muscle tremors , and that tends to lead people to being less and less mobile .
secondly , a political theorist who 's going to talk about the crisis of democracy is probably not the most exciting topic you can think about .
and this time even a greater number , 83 percent of the people , voted with blank ballots .
basically this was also a major outbreak , a culture of dissent , a culture of basically non-conformism , which was not known before .
remember , until the 1970s , the spread of democracy has always been accompanied by the decline of inequality .
before , revolutions used to have ideological names .
but is this the idea of a free society ?
in the late 1980s , in a moment of youthful indiscretion , i went to law school .
doesn 't work .
i mean , i 'm an american . i believe in free markets .
so glucksberg did another experiment similar to this where he presented the problem in a slightly different way , like this up here . okay ?
think about your own work .
what happened ? as long as the task involved only mechanical skill bonuses worked as they would be expected : the higher the pay , the better the performance .
there is a mismatch between what science knows and what business does .
but if you want engagement , self-direction works better .
and at google , as many of you know , about half of the new products in a typical year are birthed during that 20 percent time : things like gmail , orkut , google news .
now if you had , just 10 years ago , if you had gone to an economist , anywhere , and said , " hey , i 've got these two different models for creating an encyclopedia .
and in ways both big and small , the narrative of the victim shapes the way we see women .
so i was amazed .
and i said , " just in case you 're looking for entrepreneurs to feature at your next investment conference , here are a couple of women . "
those in small businesses can 't get the capital they need to expand and those in microbusiness can 't grow out of them .
we have so much room to grow .
the women in my family are not exceptions .
it 's called pleaching , or grafting trees together , or grafting inosculate matter into one contiguous , vascular system .
we had a big show in prague , and we decided to put it in front of the cathedral so religion can confront the house of meat .
no , well , i don 't know , it 's very familiar to me .
i know some of you are just , you know , bingo ! or , i don 't know .
i can understand the question , though . " but is it music ? "
this was based on the experience of actually watching two people having a virulent argument in sign language , which produced no decibels to speak of , but affectively , psychologically , was a very loud experience .
i 've decided , ultimately , that this is the wrong question , that this is not the important question .
no one was there , and they came out , and they did this incredible dance .
three strokes , you get the whole bamboo forest .
and in a way , that is what makes it spiritual .
hm : they are both in either 's powers .
and it was the sand castle , the idea of nurture versus nature , that we build these civilizations -- she speaks about it at the end , helen mirren 's prospera -- we build them , but under nature , under the grand tempest , these cloud-capped towers , these gorgeous palaces will fade and there will -- leave not a rack behind .
it 's really comic book live . it 's a comic book coming alive .
the wind was massively blowing , and the only way i could get to the other side was to look at the line straight in front of me .
like , i remember one day i found my dad convulsing , foaming at the mouth , od-ing on the bathroom floor .
i was accepted to pepperdine university , and i came back to the same school that i attended to be a special ed assistant .
but now , shifting an entire paradigm , it hasn 't been an easy journey , nor is it even complete .
and it takes a school board member who is going to lobby for you and say , " know , the district is trying to impose this , but you have the freedom to do otherwise . "
for three times , i applied to biomedical science , to be a doctor .
thirteen species -- highest diversity we can find in one single area in africa .
who have been doing that ?
because he 's pygmy , he knows how to track elephants in the forest .
so , it was so bad .
tried to protect our equipment , tried to protect our staff and the villages of about 1,500 people .
i don 't know . "
what we are doing after that -- that was the situation of the war -- we have to rebuild .
everybody is happy , but see what it 's doing , see what is going in darfur .
what you can assist us , it 's by building capacities .
i left the kaaba to eat something in downtown mecca .
first of all , muslims -- pious , conservative , believing muslims who want to be loyal to their religion -- should not cling onto everything in their culture , thinking that that 's divinely mandated .
and it is no secret that many islamic movements in the middle east tend to be authoritarian , and some of the so-called " islamic regimes " such as saudi arabia , iran and the worst case was the taliban in afghanistan -- they are pretty authoritarian . no doubt about that .
the koran , for example , doesn 't condone stoning .
similarly , in the arab world , there was what the great arab historian albert hourani defines as the liberal age .
and i think the west , at least some powers in the west , particularly the united states , made the mistake of supporting those secular dictators , thinking that they were more helpful for their interests .
and thanks to that , turkey has been able to reasonably create a success story in which islam and the most pious understandings of islam have become part of the democratic game , and even contributes to the democratic and economic advance of the country .
but more importantly , it spoke of a deeper yearning , something far more sophisticated than hunting magic .
there is no trajectory of progress . there 's no pyramid that conveniently places victorian england at the apex and descends down the flanks to the so-called primitives of the world .
and with the blessing of trulshik rinpoche , we began a pilgrimage to a curious destination , accompanied by a great doctor .
you run down to the base of the sacred mountain , antakillqa .
and then beyond salcantay , of course , when the southern cross reaches the southernmost point in the sky , directly in that same alignment , the milky way overhead .
they refer to the movements as they exploit the ecological niches of the gradient as " threads . "
for that entire time , the world only exists as an abstraction , as he is taught the values of society , including this notion that their prayers alone maintain the cosmic balance .
a people who find a way , with their imagination , to carve life out of that very frozen .
so , you 're living through a time when virtually half of humanity 's intellectual , social and spiritual legacy is being allowed to slip away .
so he 's actually using the video camera on the device to follow my face .
and in the same way that you scroll through content on an ipad , i can actually adjust the angle of the camera on the device .
this is actually something that one of our engineers , dom , built in a weekend .
i was 26 years in the corporate world , trying to make organizations profitable .
the first parikrma school started in a slum where there were 70,000 people living below the poverty line .
i mean like once i pick up one book i cannot put it down until i finish the whole book .
now they have started writing their signature .
everybody was very friendly , especially i got a lot of friends .
we 've got the best school award for three years successively .
we have a model by which kids can speak english and understand english in three month 's time .
and i felt really badly , because i couldn 't give her a good answer .
you gotta push through shyness and self-doubt .
the internet , the web as we know it , the kind of web -- the things we 're all talking about -- is already less than 5,000 days old .
if there is only one machine , and our little handhelds and devices are actually just little windows into those machines , but that we 're basically constructing a single , global machine .
brewster was saying the library of congress is about twenty terabytes .
these are all basically portals into that one machine .
so every item , every artifact that we make , will have embedded in it some little sliver of web-ness and connection , and it will be part of this machine , so that our environment -- kind of in that ubiquitous computing sense -- our environment becomes the web . everything is connected .
so we have a trillion eyes , and ears , and touches , through all our digital photographs and cameras .
so , i don 't know what the name of this thing is .
all this data about you should just be conveyed , and you should do it once and that 's all that should happen .
we 're so dependent on this that i have now gotten to the point where i don 't even try to remember things -- i 'll just google it . it 's easier to do that .
so the single idea that i wanted to leave with you is that we have to begin to think about this as not just " the web , only better , " but a new kind of stage in this development .
the next day , all the artists were invited to join mandela in robben island , where he was going to give a conference to the world 's press , standing in front of his former prison cell .
they have tremendous outreach to the people who are living directly with the effects of the virus .
the message that unaids are currently sending out to the world is that we would like to see the virtual elimination of the transmission of the virus from mother to child by 2015 .
and i 'm getting -- the hairs on my -- i don 't know if you can see the hairs on my arms .
that he was in all these other locations as well , but experiencing them as separate individuals .
what physics tells us is that everything comes down to geometry and the interactions of elementary particles .
these familiar particles also have less familiar second and third generations , which have the same charges as the first but have much higher masses .
these particles also have anti-particles , which have opposite charges .
they tell us what interactions are allowed to happen .
if we guess wisely , we can construct the standard charges in six charge dimensions as a broken symmetry of this more perfect pattern in seven charge dimensions .
as we spin it , we can see many of the other intricate patterns contained in this one .
and , of course , bad for me personally .
and you may have noticed that these beautiful views are similar , but in slightly different places .
how should we think of an electron in relation to e8 ?
or maybe you 've called to mind the toddler phase when children are learning how to walk and talk and use a fork .
and because the fetus is with her all the time , it hears her voice a lot .
babies seem to remember and prefer these tastes once they 're out in the world .
will it be safe and protected , or will it face constant dangers and threats ?
one explanation is that fetuses are making the best of a bad situation .
about a year after 9 / 11 , researchers examined a group of women who were pregnant when they were exposed to the world trade center attack .
this is what he had to say .
now , that was a pretty good system for most of the history of the regulation of land , until this technology came along , and people began to wonder , were these instruments trespassers as they flew over land without clearing the rights of the farms below as they traveled across the country ?
okay . three stories . here 's the argument .
i want to share all my love with you ...
common sense here , though , has not yet revolted in response to this response that the law has offered to these forms of creativity .
it 's the point about how this connects to our kids .
here are a few quotes indicating that : " man has no nature , " from the historian jose ortega y gasset ; " man has no instincts , " from the anthropologist ashley montagu ; " the human brain is capable of a full range of behaviors and predisposed to none , " from the late scientist stephen jay gould .
as you can see , there are two inventors with identical contraptions in their lap , meeting in the waiting room of a patent attorney .
in the book , i go over controversies such as this one , and a number of other hot buttons , hot zones , chernobyls , third rails , and so on -- including the arts , cloning , crime , free will , education , evolution , gender differences , god , homosexuality , infanticide , inequality , marxism , morality , nazism , parenting , politics , race , rape , religion , resource depletion , social engineering , technological risk and war .
let me start with the arts .
students are staying away in droves , universities are disinvesting in the arts and humanities .
what a puzzle -- i wonder why .
that would make them super-similar , right ?
and he said that he could actually see an x-ray of his fingers , because the light was so bright .
so i decided to do this symbolic swim at the top of the world , in a place which should be frozen over , but which now is rapidly unfreezing .
i had to see my coach screaming for me , " come on lewis ! come on ! go ! go ! go ! don 't slow down ! "
and they had burst . and i was in so much agony .
and at worst , i didn 't even want to think about it .
just scuttle forward and go for it . "
lp : thank you very much . thank you very much .
we 've come a long way . we 're doing good .
but i was still concerned , so i said , " you know what , i 'm not going to do it . "
and he pulled the whole mean down , destroying my statistical significance of the test .
i was eliminating the data to get the true pattern of the data to shine through .
and the unimaginable happened : it became the first car to ever return from a darpa grand challenge , winning stanford 2 million dollars .
you could regain this time .
so this goes against the conventional wisdom that we should tell our friends our goals , right -- so they hold us to it .
well , there 's also another program , in another agency within our government , in ocean exploration .
mostly discoveries made by accident .
back then -- actually my first expedition was when i was 17 years old . it was 49 years ago .
this is all accurate except for one thing -- it 's pitch black .
it was hot . it wasn 't hot enough .
no mouth , no gut , no digestive system .
the ph of 11 , and yet it had chemosynthetic bacteria living in it and at this extreme environment .
more recently , finding ancient history .
it comes online this summer , and it begins its journey of exploration .
but the beauty of this , too , is we can then disseminate it to children .
why do we have programs to build habitation on mars , and we have programs to look at colonizing the moon , but we do not have a program looking at how we colonize our own planet ?
that 's a big thing in california .
i got up in the morning and i didn 't say a word .
" oh , so you really want to go to school here ?
he came back ; he said to me , " ok john , now that you 've registered for that one credit , you can have a key to an office , you can matriculate -- you 're matriculating , so you can use the library .
now this was a discussion class and we were having a discussion .
and i 'm thanking you , and i 'm thanking my family because they had come to hear me speak .
i started talking because i had studied environment .
it took me 100 miles to figure out that , in my heart , in me , i had become a prisoner .
as our former vice president said , we have to become activists .
it 's risk . it 's reward . it 's randomness .
he has this little 10-square-meter store , where so much is being done .
basically , you don 't have to necessarily buy brand new things . you have condemned computers that are stripped apart , and you can buy salvaged components and things that you can reassemble in a new configuration .
so one of the first things we did is this thing called a multimedia platform . we call it a lunch box .
out comes this , a little lunch box -- form factor .
so the real key question was , how do we empower this woman ?
great . good news .
we can speak only with music .
but i wanted to look not at the astronomical universe , but at the computational universe .
we 're just following this very simple rule at the bottom here , but we 're getting all this amazing stuff .
but i 'm happy to say it 's actually going really well .
or let 's try asking about , i don 't know , the international space station .
but , in many ways , we 're still at the very beginning with wolfram alpha .
let 's try this here .
i 'm hoping we can , for example , use that even to get wolfram alpha to routinely do invention and discovery on the fly , and to find all sorts of wonderful stuff that no engineer and no process of incremental evolution would ever come up with .
one 's got to build a structure that 's probably at least as deep as existing physics .
sw : i think so .
despite the fact that each and every one of these disorders originates in the brain , most of these disorders are diagnosed solely on the basis of observable behavior .
after justin was given anti-seizure medication , the change in him was amazing .
damn it , even the books here are made out of plants .
god forbid that it should have to withstand that .
and this is a distributed network .
how much does it cost ?
so we took a room downstairs in the basement that had been used as sort of an abu ghraib annex .
and at a certain point , you look around , you 're like , " whoa , this is a really nerdy crowd . "
there 's people getting drunk building lego , and you 've got to finish the thing before you puke .
i tried on the idea of eking out another two years in washington , or maybe uprooting my sons from their school and my husband from his work and asking them to join me .
think about a lawyer who spends part of his time at school events for his kids talking to other parents .
they 're psychiatrists .
increasingly in developed countries , women are socialized to believe that our place is no longer only in the home , but men are actually still where they always were .
they can walk a baby or soothe a toddler just as well as their wives can , and they are increasingly doing much more of the housework .
how far and how fast is up to us .
here is a drawing by leonardo da vinci , 500 years ago , before photography .
when i do make some money , i 'll have one machined for myself .
but these things evolved over many years , and now what we 're trying to do -- i get three weeks to design a telephone .
i 'm also interested in growth patterns : the unbridled way that nature grows things so you 're not restricted by form at all .
i set out to look at natural forms .
we need to be in that realm . i want to do stuff like that .
this kind of effervescent , fully charged sense of soup that delivers ideas .
the only place that didn 't laugh was moscow .
i 'm not putting charles eames ' furniture in buildings anymore .
yeah , and it has an internal handrail which gives it it 's strength . it 's this holistic integration .
this -- sorry -- -- that 's a solar seed . it 's a concept for new architecture .
it sounds like some quiz show or something , doesn 't it ?
in fact , what archeologists have found is none of that .
or maybe that big ?
and the proponents of this theory point to that small pocket of dravidian-speaking people in the north , actually near afghanistan , and they say that perhaps , sometime in the past , dravidian languages were spoken all over india and that this suggests that the indus civilization is perhaps also dravidian .
or better yet , let 's all collectively decipher .
the indus script also exhibits similar kinds of patterns .
and this could be really useful as we try to decipher the script by generating more data that we can analyze .
there were people who raised a hue and cry , and these people were the ones who believed that the indus script does not represent language .
what i haven 't told you is that the indus people were very , very enterprising .
you have to figure out the sounds of each of these pictures such that the entire sequence makes sense .
the mayans started speaking to us in the 20th century , but the indus civilization remains silent .
now i 'm destined to spend a lot of time with some unique , very , very special , individualistic and often seductive female characters .
but we 're really there seeking and searching and filming the iconic cats .
but that 's , i think , what this is all about , is that these individuals have these personalities and characters .
now back to the leopard .
and of course , the baby baboon was so innocent , it didn 't turn and run .
leopards have plummeted from 700,000 down to a mere 50,000 .
they 're essential to the habitat .
i couldn 't even do the simplest trick , but it was very natural for me , because i was not dextrous , and hated all sports .
i won the world yo-yo contest again in the artistic performance division .
smell has this reputation of being somewhat different for each person .
and i will try and explain to you what 's wrong with this notion .
i love the idea of doing less work . so let me explain to you why -- a very simple fact that tells you why this shape theory really does not work very well .
i went searching for a type of molecule , any molecule , that would have that vibration and that -- the obvious prediction was that it should absolutely smell of sulfur .
bob jacklovich and john lamb at ford motor company , in the days when ford motor was spending vast amounts of money on fundamental research , discovered a way to build a spectroscope that was intrinsically nano-scale .
and it is the classic synthetic aroma chemical , ok ?
and i said , well , by whom ? i mean most , you know -- there 's three attitudes : you 're right , and i don 't know why , which is the most rational one at this point .
so if you really want to solve the problem of epidemics and so forth , let 's start with that . and since i got that idea , i 've had to shake hundreds of hands .
wouldn 't that be enough ? and then the children would get plenty of support , and nurturing , and mentoring , and the world population would decline very rapidly and everybody would be totally happy .
you see , there 's two forks in the road . we know that people live twice as long as chimpanzees almost , and nobody lives more than 120 years , for reasons that aren 't very well understood .
nobody knows how most of them work in detail , but we do know that there 're lots of different things in there .
and the second point , making the case that kids can really change the world .
so that 's my fusion reactor in the background there .
but that began thinking about how birds went around , and then how airplanes would , how hang gliders would fly , and then other planes , and the idea of the gossamer-condor-type airplane quickly emerged , was so logical , one should have thought of it in the first place , but one didn 't . and it was just , keep the weight down -- 70 pounds was all it weighed -- but let the size swell up , like a hang glider , but three times the span , three times the cord .
i wanted to -- well , one of the biggest changes is , 200 years ago , we began using coal from underground , which has a lot of pollution , and 100 years ago , began getting gasoline from underground , with a lot of pollution . and gasoline consumption , or production , will reach its limit in about ten years , and then go down , and we wonder what 's going to happen with transportation .
so this just summarizes it . " over billions of years , on a unique sphere , chance has painted a thin covering of life -- complex and probable , wonderful and fragile .
this is more than 10,000 feet higher than the previous world 's altitude record held by the sr-71 blackbird .
how old were you when you invented that ?
in this rather long sort of marathon presentation , i 've tried to break it up into three parts : the first being a whole lot of examples on how it can be a little bit more pleasurable to deal with a computer and really address the qualities of the human interface .
in fact , they 're not : it 's really a very , very high-resolution input medium -- you have to just do it twice , you have to touch the screen and then rotate your finger slightly -- and you can move a cursor with great accuracy .
let me see if i can load another disc and show you , quickly , an example .
you 're going to sort of breathe life into it .
there are all sorts of techniques you will use -- and again , this is a different kind of branching .
ok . i 'm at the third and last part of this , which i said i would make an attempt to at least give you some examples that may be more directly related to the world of entertainment .
the child read beautifully , it turned out , and was really very competent . so it actually meant something .
and my last example -- as some of my former colleagues , whom i see in the room , can imagine what it will be .
okay , outstanding . so i invented that .
when i first heard this , i was quite proud of myself .
you 've seen those things , right ? like a book ?
so for example , ticketmaster .
so this actually has given rise to a really big internet meme that tens of thousands of people have participated in , which is called captcha art .

what i try to communicate , and you can help me if you agree , is that aid for africa is just great value for money at a time when america really needs it .
i think they just have one idea in their mind , which is , where you live in the world should not determine whether you live in the world .
you know , there 's lots out there .
but you know , we want , we need some airtime for our ideas .
bono : all right . i wish for ted to truly show the power of information , its power to rewrite the rules and transform lives , by connecting every hospital , health clinic and school in one african country .
and that is my third and final wish for you at the ted conference .
this work has been done with an extraordinary group of people , and they 've done all the work , and i 'm the great bullshitter that tries to bring it all together .
very few cities fail .
and that line there is a prediction from the same theory , based on the same principles , that describes that forest .
it 's three-quarters , roughly , which is less than one -- and we call that sublinear .
don 't know . we will discuss that .
but most important in this , the exponent , the analog to that three-quarters for the metabolic rate , is bigger than one -- it 's about 1.15 to 1.2 .
if it 's social networks with super-linear scaling -- more per capita -- then the theory says that you increase the pace of life .
so lastly , i 'm going to finish up in this last minute or two asking about companies .
there they are . that 's 23,000 companies .
elasticity of mind is something that we really need , you know , we really need , we really cherish and we really work on .
new sensing elements on the body -- you can grow hairs on your nails , and therefore grab some of the particles from another person .
so , this is indeed made of human bone tissue .
so the idea of collective design is something that will become even bigger in the future , and this is chosen as an example .
but here instead are examples , you can already 3d-print textiles , which is very interesting .
those are a series of robots that are meant to be taken care of .
so instead of having only the pictures , you will be able to put this object next to the computer and all of a sudden have , you know , gertrude 's whole life and all of her files and her address book come alive .
well , what i want us to think about for a moment is what happens after that , after you drop your vote into the ballot box .
and on each ballot form there is this encrypted value in the form of this 2d barcode on the right .
and these are elections by the people , for the people .
and while this certainly remained the key for a cure , this seemed extraordinarily complicated to me .
it took many years , but eventually we developed an electrochemical neuroprosthesis that transformed the neural network in the spinal cord from dormant to a highly functional state .
we were so frustrated .
they are working so close to each other that there is horizontal transfer of dna .
for me they normally happen , these career crises , often , actually , on a sunday evening , just as the sun is starting to set , and the gap between my hopes for myself , and the reality of my life , start to diverge so painfully that i normally end up weeping into a pillow .
and according to how you answer that question , people are either incredibly delighted to see you , or look at their watch and make their excuses .
and it 's a beautiful idea .
but the point is , it doesn 't feel that way .
that 's exhilarating if you 're doing well , and very crushing if you 're not .
insane idea , if you 're a secularist person , like me .
i wanted to see how they would seize the bare bones of certain stories if they came in as a news item at the news desk on a saturday afternoon .
that 's a very new situation .
thing about a successful life is , a lot of the time , our ideas of what it would mean to live successfully are not our own .
alain de botton : yes . i think it 's merely the randomness of the winning and losing process that i wanted to stress .
that 's true in everything risky except technology .
you make the text larger with each tap .
it 's also a complete faa database .
and finally , it often happens that you 're giving a talk , and for some reason the audience is looking at the slide instead of at you !
this arrest occurred because there was cooperation between the london metropolitan police and the economic and financial crimes commission of nigeria -- led by one of our most able and courageous people : mr. nuhu ribadu .
so when we talk about this kind of corruption , let us also think about what is happening on the other side of the globe -- where the money 's going and what can be done to stop it .
we -- as a result , we decided to liberalize many of our markets .
we de-linked that , and once we did it , we began to budget at a price slightly lower than the oil price and save whatever was above that price .
and now , we have a situation in which the businesses in this mall are doing four times the turnover that they had projected .
and , you know , you have the neighborhood effect where if something is going on in one part of the continent , it looks like the entire continent is affected .
so that shows you that we have people who are capable of doing .
and some of these people believe that in that struggle , it is sometimes okay to take up arms .
why do you keep using the word jihad in your friday sermons ?
they even use the brand name he created for his jihad .
and then the taliban gave the keys of kandahar to osama bin laden . he made it our problem .
al jazeera brought information to them , showed them what was being said and done in the name of their religion , exposed the hypocrisy of osama bin laden and al qaeda , and allowed them , gave them the information that allowed them to come to their own conclusions .
bin laden is dead . bin ladenism has been defeated .
and so i 'd make the car stop , and i 'd get out of the car and walk , and see that in fact there wasn 't a hole , but it was a trick of my eye , it was a shadow , you know .
because i look at the way women are portrayed all the time .
so actually , check this out .
i don 't know how to put this .
i started making puppets when i was a kid .
and so i had this t.v. show .
rod : of course i want to look cute .
im : so by the way . of all the most unboring things in the world , right .
we actually shoot segments like t.v. show segments .
in the old days when they used to make butter , you know how you make butter ?
you 're like the raspyni brothers , where you 've got your balls in cold water . and -- -- you just play with your fingers all day . and then you get invited .
there 's the world trade center site , on the front cover .
manifest destiny .
the computer revolution , the technocratic , technological revolution , has allowed us to jettison normal-shaped buildings , traditionally shaped buildings , in favor of non-orthogonal buildings such as this .
in the summer , you go to the beach .
they were able to create something wonderful .
rosa mexicano restaurant , where he transports us to the shores of acapulco , up on the upper west side , with this wall of cliff divers who -- there you go , like that .
and then the second step is to say , " the situation is admittedly dangerous , but only for a short time . "
and why is it so difficult initially ?
the donors provide post-conflict aid .
if the security council doesn 't commit to security over the course of a decade , you don 't get the reassurance which produces private investment .
what is a distinctive approach to generating jobs in post-conflict situations ?
basically , prices soar and crooked politicians then milk the rents from the sector , but it doesn 't generate any jobs .
and in between , there should be a public agency , the independent service authority , which channels public money , and especially donor money , to the retail providers .
paddy ashdown , who was the grand high nabob of bosnia to the united nations , in his book about his experience , he said , " i realize what i needed was accountants without borders , to follow that money . "
i 'm going to come back to that in a moment .
suppose you see a teapot , and the teapot is filled with hot water .
and there 's a lot of rewards in thinking about complexity and emergence , not so much in thinking about simplicity .
but then , if you know everything you can know about those two things , and you put them together , what can you say about this combination ?
and think of things in your life that are binary , one of them is light switches .
which , in this simple portal makes the claim that it makes accessible all of the world 's information .
it just is not possible .
and i think that 's a very good way of thinking about the problem .
so , in terms of that diagnostic technology that you 've got , where is that , and when do you see that maybe getting rolled out to scale .
so now just take a minute .
his parents think sometimes it 's a precious commodity , so they 'll keep it in a cupboard .
last week , i was in ghana with the minister of health , because if you don 't know , there 's a cholera outbreak in ghana at the moment .
i trained in europe 's premier school of public health .
sixty-five million years ago , a very important and catastrophic event changed the course of life on land .
yes , they do have larger body size , but many of them are smaller , but we 're interested in the time it took them to achieve that .
that 's where dinosaur origins is to be found : at the bottom of the cliff .
to be able to excavate the 80 tons of dinosaurs that we have in the sahara and take them out , you really have to put together an expedition team that can handle the conditions .
that 's a 2,000 mile journey .
so what we 're trying to piece together here is a story .
somebody get the front legs .
we found this last year .
they did it within two or three degrees of the pole , to maintain similarity between continents .
and i went on -- that 's my first painting on canvas .
niger is equally important , and i 'm trying desperately to do something in niger .
and so , that 's what we 're going to do . we 're planning a permanent home in chicago .
what it does is use the internet to create an infinite marketplace to match person a 's " haves " with person c 's " wants , " whatever they may be .
over the next minute , you 're going to see a bit like a conceptual fireworks display of all the dots that went on in my head .
yet , it 's hard for us to individually know what to do .
that matches mr. jones , with some spare space in his back garden , with mrs. smith , a would-be grower .
they could only use their zipcar membership when absolutely necessary .
now in the old consumer system , our reputation didn 't matter so much , because our credit history was far more important that any kind of peer-to-peer review .
oceans of adolescents come here to receive lessons but never learn to swim , part like the red sea when the bell rings .
so , when you start to think about politicians , you 've got to realize these are strange creatures .
it 's a letter .
when you do this , don 't attack people ; you attack tactics .
and you actually get into the folder that the elected official actually has to read .
so that 's the personal reason .
that 's the hospital we 're working with in delhi , the schroff charity eye hospital .
the next obvious question to ask : what is the process of recovery ?
even the shadow on the ball becomes its own object .
ps : and we see this pattern over and over again .
here 's what a baby-cam video looks like .
looking ahead , if you think of this disk as representing all of the children we 've treated so far , this is the magnitude of the problem .
but we 're also left with a concentrated salt solution , or brine .
that 's the question i 've been struggling with , coming from my very different perspective .
i 'm a business school professor , but i 've actually founded , i think , now , four nonprofits .
because we don 't have the resources .
how do we tap into this ?
the classic example is pollution .
having a safer working environment actually , and avoiding accidents , it makes the business more profitable , because it 's a sign of good processes .
shared value is capitalism , but it 's a higher kind of capitalism .
see , i 've asked that question all the way across the country , and everywhere i ask it , no matter where , there 's always a huge portion of the audience that won 't put up their hand .
this girl right here knows exactly what i 'm talking about .
you 're just one of the people who hasn 't been told .
they may collect over 300 kilos in their bags , shopping carts , bicycles and carroças .
pimp my carroça took to the streets of são paulo , rio de janeiro and curitiba .
and at the same time we were being told what we were , we were being asked , " what do you want to be when you grow up ? "
we were being told that we somehow must become what we are not , sacrificing what we are to inherit the masquerade of what we will be .
when i was 19 , i wrote , " i will love myself despite the ease with which i lean toward the opposite . "
i told her , whenever i 'm sad , my grandmother gives me karate chops .
he tried to kill himself in grade 10 when a kid who could still go home to mom and dad had the audacity to tell him , " get over it . "
we grew up learning to cheer on the underdog because we see ourselves in them .
we talk about it in terms of engagement , or non-compliance .
they showed bloody gums .
the notion of efficacy basically boils down to one -- that if somebody believes that they have the capacity to change their behavior .
but it actually hits home .
they last for about five miles , in which case we put our foot back on the pedal .
so this is a different approach .
they 're just not for us . they 're not for people . they 're not for patients .
but you don 't have to wade through it . you don 't have to go through the junk .
and so we spent a good deal of our time indicating that .
and the only acceptable answer is -- -- yes .
and so , how i see my work contributing is sort of trying to literally re-imagine these connections and physically rebuild them .
now the gowanus is particularly smelly -- i will admit it .
so again , we got the short end of the deal there .
it also creates this incredibly interesting , i think , new amphibious public space , where you can imagine working , you can imagine recreating in a new way .
but we imagine , with our calculations , that by 2050 , you might be able to sink your teeth into a gowanus oyster .
and the people thought , " you know , you 're right .
and then , finally talk a little bit about a third way , about another technology , which is probably better than anything we have , but which -- there hasn 't been any enthusiasm for adoption precisely because people are so enamored with the current car seat solution . ok .
and it 's not just overall . it 's very robust to anything you want to look at .
now , eventually , one did . under the conditions of anonymity , they said they would be happy to do this test for us -- so anonymity , and 1,500 dollars per seat that we crashed .
the federal standards are that you have to score below a 1,000 to be an approved car seat on this crash , in some metric of units which are not important .
and so i think the answer to this puzzle is that there 's a much better solution out there , that 's gotten nobody excited because everyone is so delighted with the way car seats are presumably working .
and the jar of pills he had , he said , were the tiniest little pills he could find , so small you could barely see them .
bottom right are the sex chromosomes .
so the price of a base , to sequence a base , has fallen 100 million times .
so first , the way in which this woman was treated , in as little as 10 years , will look like bloodletting .
the year after it 's $ 100 , give or take a year .
this is a typewriter , a staple of every desktop for decades .
do you really want to elect a president whose genome suggests cardiomyopathy ?
how many fathers in the room ? raise your hands .
i can 't believe in the doctrines .
now education is a field the secular world really believes in .
why ? they don 't think we need it .
what 's the difference between a sermon and our modern , secular mode of delivery , the lecture ?
the other things that religions do is to arrange time .
that 's very good .
so in orthodox jewish communities , every friday you go to a mikveh .
art is about two things in all the major faiths .
the people in the modern world , in the secular world , who are interested in matters of the spirit , in matters of the mind , in higher soul-like concerns , tend to be isolated individuals .
now we may not agree with what religions are trying to teach us , but we can admire the institutional way in which they 're doing it .
you can get shot by the hard-headed atheists , and you can get shot by those who fully believe .
atheism shouldn 't cut itself off from the rich sources of religion .
alain , thank you for sparking many conversations later .
i mean , i want games to be a force for good in the world .
they help us stay connected with people in our social network that we would otherwise grow distant from , if we weren 't playing games together .
for me that meant no reading , no writing , no video games , no work or email , no running , no alcohol , no caffeine .
now it wasn 't a miracle cure for the headaches or the cognitive symptoms .
but scientists now know that a traumatic event doesn 't doom us to suffer indefinitely .
we 're going to play a quick game together .
we know from the scientific research that willpower actually works like a muscle .
all right , pick one , last quest : shake someone 's hand for six seconds , or send someone a quick thank you by text , email , facebook or twitter . go !
you still have your special mission , your secret mission .
our core project is a rather ambitious folly -- i suppose , a mythic undertaking : to build a 10,000-year clock that can really keep good time for that long a period .
underground in a place that 's really solid .
and now let 's look at the grand truth of what 's there .
ok , back to danny 's list .
they 're the world 's oldest living thing .
this is one of the mines . it doesn 't have any beryllium in it .
they don 't quite meet .
so you can scratch lincoln canyon as an approach .
in fact , there he is . that 's alexander rose .
and that 's also timberline and those bristlecones really are shrubs .
in fact , there are artesian wells where water springs right into the air .
most of the amazingness of the clock we can borrow from the amazingness of the mountain .
when i turn the crank and i apply pressure , it makes a sound like a barking dog .
they told his parents that they predicted that he was going to be a star .
that 's an awful lot of women when you multiply by the number of women who were diagnosed with this osteopenia .
i didn 't make up pre-vivor .
we have this system where that 's what you do .
i am a serial entrepreneur turned serial investor .
i would much rather invest in somebody -- you know , take a chance on somebody -- who i know is straight than somebody where there 's any possible question of , you know , who are they looking out for , and what 's going on .
if you 're telling me you 're going to be the great developer of the map of the human genome , you 'd better know what a human genome is .
so i don 't want somebody who 's going to cut and run at the first opportunity .
you 've got to do a whole pitch that conveys this without conveying it .
well , first of all , logical progression .
and those , for example , are anything you tell me that i know is not true .
no . who do you think we should look at as our role model ?
you look at the image and you see that , and you drop the whole thing .
and it lets me put everything else in relation to something you 've already told me .
but then , everybody has competition .
but then comes the ask .
you 've got to give me the final , you know -- boom ! -- the final pitch that 's going to send me into space .
have you seen me touch the computer ?
okay ?
the other thing about human beings is that we love to be entertained .
two acknowledgments before our first data slide : for inspiring me to even think about the idea of conscience and the tricks that conscience can play on us on a daily basis , i thank legendary rabbi , jack stern .
this chart is going to document a very similar trend .
social commentary and irreverence rise throughout the 70s .
so here you are , in my favorite chart , because this is our last 20 years .
i can choose the next american idol . you 're fired .
dan rather : since the september 11th attack on the world trade center , many people have flocked to downtown new york to see and pay respects at what amounts to the 16-acre burial ground .
j the walls are bare by design , so people can fill them with their own memorials the way they already have along the current perimeter .
so we tried to come up with a way , as a group , to have a kind of design swat team .
so we said , what is -- it was not an inclusive group ?
so seeing this in a very simple , dignified way was a very powerful experience .
and we met with him .
so we didn 't know what to do , but we decided to cast a very wide net .
because when we looked at the four platforms around the site , one of which is an upgrade of the families ' platform , we knew that these had to be moveable to respond to changing conditions , and the changing definition of what ground zero is .
and six months after the fact -- and only a few months away from the site being cleaned -- we are very quickly , now , getting to the point where those conversations about what should go there are getting serious .
i think a public dialogue -- i think , you know , i 'd like to see an international competition , and a call for ideas for uses .
this shows saint paul 's on the left .
the fund was deposited as a family reassure , in a safe , reliable security company in dakar , senegal , where i was only given temporary asylum .
really cool , we were getting wasted .
maybe i can come back next year , or something like that .
zf : you get off the stage .
so , i made this for ted . it 's " christian . "
and eventually , it just makes them stop playing with it , or draw , you know , they draw penises and things like that .
ladies and gentlemen , mr. ze frank .
it 's meant to be a mechanism for construing the universe in a way that will bring about the salvation of the individual believer , but it 's also meant by the islamists -- and i use that term to mean people who believe that islam -- they follow the slogan , islam is the answer to a wide range of questions , whether they 're social , or political , or personal , or spiritual .
other people would say it means something else .
and they furthermore think overwhelmingly -- again one can 't speak of every person , but overwhelmingly , and one can find this by reading any of the sources that they have produced , and they 're all over the internet and in all sorts of languages -- one can see that they 're saying that their concern in their own countries is primarily to free up themselves to have choice in the spheres of personal life , in the sphere of economics , in the sphere of politics , and , yes , in the sphere of religion , which is itself closely regulated in most of the muslim world .
so in morocco , for example , they finished third in the political race but they were only allowed to contest half the seats .
you face the circumstances you have in front of you and you go forward .
so dad continued to do this kind of work by hand , and a few years later , he was diagnosed with cancer .
now , everyone else had assumed it was , and we knew it was because we were working with it .
we had no idea that would happen .
so we got one of these robots .
nowadays , high school students can build robots like the industrial robot my dad and i tried to build .
and she would design these toys , where kids in playing with the toys would actually come to understand these deep principles of life and nature through play .
the players are going to play through every generation of this species , and as you play the game the creature is actually growing bit by bit .
i can move around here . i can extend .
and so at this point the computer is procedurally animating this creature .
now , at this point we 're actually dealing with a very little toy planet .
so one of the things i can do is start pumping more co2 gases into the atmosphere , and so that 's what i 'm doing here .
so in fact , we 're going to have this unlimited number of worlds you can kind of explore here . now , as we move into the future , and we start going out in this space and doing stuff , we 're drawing a lot from things like science fiction .
so we 're flying over here to what looks like a black hole .
i can love a book , a movie .
now individuals are free to value or disvalue any attitude , any choice , any object .
it is hard to say what shape this intensification will take , because it largely depends on social and technical innovations , which are by definition difficult to predict .
how to renounce the hysterical need to be valued ?
it is a sort of poetry of deliberate awkwardness .
and if we had a computer put into the body of a person who 's at risk , we could know , before they even have symptoms , that they 're having a heart attack , to save their life .
and computers don 't go to sleep .
can you see it in the picture after the big rise of the qrs -- you see st elevation ?
then it goes to a network operations center , where they get your data from your patient database that 's been put in at some central location , say , in the united states .
this is what an aura looks like .
ss : researchers are hoping to present their studies to the fda this summer .
there 's a cut made in the scalp ; it 's opened ; the neurosurgeon has a template ; he marks it around , and uses a dental burr to remove a piece of the cranial bone exactly the size of our device .
so , to get quickly to my first wish -- the brain operates by electrical signals .
i 've seen pictures , graphs in today 's usa today showing it skyrocketing out of control , and this is one factor .
that would save hundreds of millions of dollars in legal costs in the united states and would decrease the cost of medicine for everyone .
in fact , i actually think that darwin is one of the people who best explains our design process .
and we saw this guy , haibao .
sustainability .
this is how it looks today ; all traffic jam .
and when she 's gone , we 're going to invite a chinese artist to reinterpret her .
this is the view from my apartment , over the sort of landscape of triangular balconies that our client called the leonardo dicaprio balcony .
the wood of your apartment continues outside becoming the facades .
we always argue a lot about the soundtrack , but in this case it was really easy to choose the song .
all right . so , like all good stories , this starts a long , long time ago when there was basically nothing .
and life starts to expand and expand and expand , until it goes kaput .
and it turns out that we keep discovering upgrades .
and by the way , this is not a debate that we 're ready for , because we have really misused the science in this .
if these differences are the difference between an olympic medal and a non-olympic medal .
and he gave a wonderful technical talk .
here 's the increase in less than a decade .
other people react with various psychological conditions or reactions to this information .
but now i 'll talk about some more pleasant things .
so , how is it that people went from the 12,000 miles a year to 500 miles ?
and the social benefits : the rate of single-occupancy vehicles is , i told you , 75 percent ; i think we can get that down to 50 percent .
car travel is underpriced and therefore we over-consumed .
and what is the cost of that communication system ?
so you know , when you stick this idea ...
and if i had my druthers , we would have an open-source version in addition to open standards .
not the least reason was the fact that i had spent those first four years living at home , driving into risd everyday , driving back .
here 's a little map . and i thought of maps at the beginning ; maybe i should just try and do a little atlas of my favorite streets and connections in rome .
over the spanish steps we go .
unfortunately , that 's a problem : they get a little too close , and when you 're in a dirigible you have to be very careful about spikes .
he 's actually in television repair , which is why people know him .
the stucco on the walls of most of the buildings in rome covers the scars ; the scars of centuries of change as these structures have been adapted rather than being torn down .
" pigeon 's progress " struck me as a catchy title .
so anyway , i went through ... and again , if packaging doesn 't work and if the stories aren 't going anywhere , i just come up with titles and hope that a title will sort of kick me off in the right direction .
through the alley , we can see the impact is captured in the red line .
fifty miles , 40 miles , it doesn 't matter .
so the blind man went down on his knees , down like this , and told the man with no legs to go over his back , and stood up .
i 'm using the knowledge i received from the united states and from my community to move them forward .
it 's a space where citizens can voice their discontent and show their power .
it would have the global reach of the world economic forum .
how could it become iconic ?
it 's made of silcon-coated glass fiber .
we couldn 't leave any traces behind .
this is the warp and weft .
if you follow policy , you probably know that a few years ago the president pledged 15 billion dollars to fight the epidemic over five years , and a lot of that money is going to go to programs that try to replicate uganda and use behavior change to encourage people and decrease the epidemic .
so if we look in this particularly high-risk sample , they 're being asked , " did you have more than one unprotected sexual partner in the last two months ? "
i think it 's possible , if we think about that intuition , and think about that fact , that maybe that explains some of this low behavior change .
but it also tells us something about one of these facts that we talked about before .
in kenya , in zambia , and a bunch of countries , there 's been testing in random samples of the population .
so this is another way to see this .
areas with a lot of economic activity -- with a lot of roads , with a lot of urbanization -- those areas have higher prevalence than others .
so you can see that both of these series -- the black line is export value , the red line is new hiv infections -- you can see they 're both increasing .
this is tim ferriss circa 1979 a.d. age two .
from that point onward i was terrified of swimming .
my feet would slice through the water like razors , i wouldn 't even move . i would leave demoralized , staring at my feet .
the arm is extended below the head .
i , like many people , came to the conclusion that i was terrible at languages .
asked him what this said .
you can also do this with grammar .
" okay , come on , grab me . "
so you can have -- and you can do it in a very small space in fact .
this would be an example of one pivot .

i wasn 't able to keep up with the business , and i ended up with a 25-year detour .
there are a lot of new things that are happening to do that , but fundamentally the process requires a tremendous amount of energy .
they have to track the sun , because they have to be pointing directly at the sun .
the whole system would have a much lower profile , but also we could gather sunlight for six and a half to seven hours a day .
so , because it went into mass production , costs were reduced , 100 years of refinement , emissions were reduced , tremendous production value .
the problem is the efficiency is one hundredth of one percent , because you 're heating all the metal of the chamber and then cooling all the metal of the chamber each time .
let me show you what it looks like in real life .
it basically figures out where on earth you are by watching the direction the sun moves , so you don 't have to actually enter anything about that .
we also think there 's very big potential for energy farms , especially in remote land where there happens to be a lot of sun .
if you get it down below five years then it becomes almost a no-brainer because the interest to own it -- someone else will finance it for you and you can just make money , basically from day one .
and so i 'm not going to talk about the painted portrait today .
so , we can then go back in our lives , if we 've got an interviewer who gets that , and begin to reflect on how we got there .
and i thought it was worth a chance , he thought it was worth a chance , and so we got up on the stage , and we had an hour conversation about his life , and after that a woman rushed up to me , essentially did , and she said , " where did you train as a doctor ? "
but after the interview , i got a call , very gruff voice , from a woman .
this wasn 't -- and some of you will remember mike wallace 's old interviews -- tough , aggressive and so forth . they have their place .
and she stonewalled me . it was unbelievable .
and she was in horrible pain .
and i 'll just give you two examples of this because of the time constraints .
agnes de mille is one of the great choreographers in our history .
and we had a conversation , and then i asked her this unthinkable question .
and what 's interesting about it isn 't the cost ; it 's the way it encodes the internet .
so , now we can compute that the output arranges material as well as information . and , ultimately , these are some slides from an early project i did , computing where the bits are stored quantum-mechanically in the nuclei of atoms , so programs rearrange the nuclear structure of molecules .
so , these are early examples in the lab of emerging technologies to digitize fabrication . computers that don 't control tools but computers that are tools , where the output of a program rearranges atoms as well as bits .
this student 's made an alarm clock you wrestle to prove you 're awake ; this is one that defends -- a dress that defends your personal space .
we didn 't think this up , that we would get pulled to these places ; we 'd open it . the first step was just empowerment .
and i still kept -- so , in the last year i 've been spending time with heads of state and generals and tribal chiefs who all want this , and i keep saying , but this isn 't the real thing .
computing , communication , energy for the rest of the planet are these top-down mega-projects .
we get the geneticists keeping on telling us how extremely closely we are related -- hardly any genes of difference , very , very closely related .
and they looked at the herbivores . and they weren 't savanna herbivores .
well , we know the answer because thomas s. kuhn wrote a seminal treatise about this back in 1962 .
he kept it to himself for 30 years .
this has come ' round to be that all those naked pachyderms have aquatic ancestors .
we have got skin lined with this layer .
i don 't believe it .

i can tell you that in three words .
i 've spent hundreds of days in psychiatric hospitals .
' i 'm being pushed into a grave . the situation is grave , ' i moan .
often , speech and thinking become disorganized to the point of incoherence .
come to the florida sunshine bush , where there are lemons , where they make demons . ' ' you 're frightening me , ' one of them said , and rebel and val headed back into the library .
at times , i spent up to 20 hours in mechanical restraints , arms tied , arms and legs tied down , arms and legs tied down with a net tied tightly across my chest .
i felt that if i could manage without medication , i could prove that , after all , i wasn 't really mentally ill , it was some terrible mistake .
hospitals are bad , they 're mad , they 're sad .
also , we must stop criminalizing mental illness .
the story begins in the late ' 90s .
as one moves up the ladder , values other than technical competence are viewed with increasing suspicion .
our public education , once a model for the world , has become most noteworthy for its failures .
they would assume the commanding role of traditional disciplines .
in this dramatically expanded ideal of a liberal arts education where the continuum of thought and action is its life 's blood , knowledge honed outside the academy becomes essential .
we persist also in being sidelined by the idea of the expert as the only one capable of coming up with answers , despite the overwhelming evidence to the contrary .
not sure of all the details , but excited .
gave them about a nine minute response , and there we went .
man down ! man down !
deborah scranton : thank you .
you know , i can answer questions about my movie , but for me to come up and talk for 18 minutes is a really long time .
we believe that the blast was right outside the gate of taji , we 're heading to that location now .
i remember giving three ivs , bandaging several wounded .
when i met the guys , and 10 of them agreed to take cameras -- in total , 21 ended up filming .
but the thing that i know you all have heard a lot of times , american soldiers saying , " why don 't they talk about the good stuff that we do ? "
but there 's always a few guys , almost always , who are the last ones .
and then i 'm going to tell her . "
the color of the lights indicates which sound i am playing .
and they are asking -- we should all be asking -- how do we use this time ?
you realize , you 're still yourself -- maybe even more so .
it 's a terrible disease . it 's fatal .
but who was i ? who were my parents -- not as parents , but as people ?
and over time , these neural pathways become hardwired , they become the norm -- even if it 's bad for us because it causes us stress and anxiety .
this is the qalandar community . they are a marginalized islamic community who live across india , and have been in india since the 13th century .
now we had to start changing these people and converting them from using that for a livelihood , to getting something else .
of course we also had to get the bears in .
they 're flower-feeders , and as they move from flower to flower , basically on a shopping trip at the local floral mart , they end up providing this valuable pollination service .
so i went to work for a commercial beekeeper , a family that owned 2,000 hives of bees in new mexico .
so what 's going on ?
and they 're trucked in in semi-loads , and they must be trucked out , because after bloom , the almond orchards are a vast and flowerless landscape .
i don 't know what it feels like to a bee to have a big , bloodsucking parasite running around on it , and i don 't know what it feels like to a bee to have a virus , but i do know what it feels like when i have a virus , the flu , and i know how difficult it is for me to get to the grocery store to get good nutrition .
we need roadsides seeded in flowers for our bees , but also for migrating butterflies and birds and other wildlife .
we need to be really appreciative of all the beekeepers out there . plant flowers .
in other words , the rise of the west , dramatic as it was , is over .
so in a town like mumbai , which is half slums , it 's 1 / 6th of the gdp of india .
these are people busy getting out of poverty just as fast as they can .
this is what makes cities -- this is what makes cities so green in the developing world .
and young people in brand new cities they 're inventing , doing new things , in the south .
so , between coal and nuclear , compare their waste products .
here 's another american design that came out of los alamos , and is now commercial .
speaking of imperatives , geoengineering is taboo now , especially in government circles , though i think there was a darpa meeting on it a couple of weeks ago , but it will be on your plate -- not this year but pretty soon , because some harsh realizations are coming along .
just to run by another one : this is a plan to brighten the reflectance of ocean clouds , by atomizing seawater ; that would brighten the albedo of the whole planet .
someone saw me on television ; they called me up ; and they asked me if i 'd like to be in a movie and to play a young doctor for a bunch of rock and roll stars who were traveling in a bus ride from san francisco to england . and i said , yes , i would do that , so i became the doctor in an absolutely awful movie called " medicine ball caravan . "
more than two -- you 're reading about larry page already , somebody reads very fast .
i 've probably had 50 women die . they all had hemorrhagic smallpox .
when we didn 't search , we had the illusion that there was no disease .
that is the surveillance system .
there 'll be no airplanes flying .
we have a joke . this is an epidemic curve , and everyone in medicine , i think , ultimately gets to know what it is .
but in all seriousness -- because this idea is birthed in ted , i would like it to be a legacy of ted , and i 'd like to call it the " international system for total early disease detection . "
immediate detection , immediate response .
and the big viz is a collection of 650 sketches that were made by two visual artists .
so that 's the part of the brain that is activated when you give a word to something .
so the act of engaging and creating interactive imagery enriches meaning .
but instead the entire team creates a shared mental model that they can all agree on and move forward on .
the deadline for the show arrived -- my paints didn 't .
we needed something to hold the net up out there in the middle of the traffic circle .
so we experimented with tiny atomized water particles to create a dry mist that is shaped by the wind and in testing , discovered that it can be shaped by people who can interact and move through it without getting wet .
i 'll leave you with this story .
that 's a magnifier times 10 .
but here comes nature that provides us with a good spider .
this is a parasitic wasp , again , two millimeters long , slender , a very quick and sharp flier .
again , we 'll start first with the pest : the thrips .
many different parts .
for example , in israel , where we employ more than 1,000 hectares -- 10,000 dunams in israeli terms -- of biological pest controlling sweet pepper under protection , 75 percent of the pesticides were actually reduced .
if we take the overall turnover of the biocontrol industry worldwide , it 's 250 million dollars .
and so i think the tempting analogy for the boom-bust that we just went through with the internet is a gold rush .
these are community affairs , by the way .
this is actually from the klondike gold rush . this is the white pass trail .
now , here 's where our analogy with the gold rush starts to diverge , and i think rather severely .
this was a huge -- as you would expect -- a huge capital build out .
but three years later , by 1908 , it weighed 40 pounds .
everybody wanted one of these electric washing machines .

tofu comes out in these big batches , and my father would sort of cut them by hand .
i found this book . it 's called , " thoughts on design , " by a man named paul rand .
it looks like illustrator ; it can , like , draw .
and someone sits down and draws a picture .
and this computer 's programmed to do only one thing , which is , if you move your mouse , the mouse changes on the screen .
i remember , like , we 'd be in his studio , like , at 2 a.m. , and then he 'd show up from some client meeting .
i noticed how we spent so much time on making it interactive -- this is , like , a touch screen -- and i noticed how you can only touch five places , and so , " why are we wasting so much interactivity everywhere ? "
this is a series of light boxes i made for a show in italy .
i discovered that i had to find the equation of art and design , which we know as circle-triangle-square .
i 'm sorry , i 'm sorry , art center -- art center is good , too .
and the same thing with the atmosphere : if you took all the atmosphere and rolled it up in a ball , you would get that little sphere of gas on the right .
they can 't go and work in the local hotel business because there isn 't one in their community .
you see people who are really shell-shocked .
personally , i think that the dispersants are a major strategy to hide the body , because we put the murderer in charge of the crime scene .
and he felt that -- he felt that it was coming to ask for help . sorry .
it 's not like we 're starting with something that 's been okay .
that one on the right is called fishing fool .
i think that 's the most important thing that people have , is compassion .
and even though the police can be a little annoying at times -- giving us tickets and stuff like that -- nobody says that we should just get rid of them .
ever since we lived in caves , every time we wanted any energy , we lit something on fire , and that is still what we 're doing .
now that 's why most of the people that work with children with autism -- speech therapists , educators -- what they do is , they try to help children with autism communicate not with words , but with pictures .
the solution came to me from a very interesting perspective .
again , if you wanted to say , " i wanted soup yesterday , " you do that by converting the word " want " into " wanted . "
i told the carpenter i could not pay him .
in about 1997 , about 15 years back , there were a group of scientists that were trying to understand how the brain processes language , and they found something very interesting .
our mouths are built to create one-dimensional sound .
but if you look at what 's inside the engine , it 's actually not very complicated .
she has quadriplegic cerebral palsy , so ever since she was born , she could neither move nor talk .
poems are made of words , nothing but words .
" the garden " " oleander : coral from lipstick ads in the 50 's .
all we can do we is listen to poems and look at poems and guess and see if they can bring us what we need , and if you 're wrong about some part of a poem , nothing bad will happen .
that 's why poems can seem at once so durable , so personal , and so ephemeral , like something inside and outside you at once .
but it 's not just business that 's affected by this , it 's actually pressed down into the daily activities of ordinary people .
it 's changed the way we talk . i was talking to a pediatrician friend in north carolina . he said , " well you know , i don 't deal with patients the same way anymore .
and of course the hindsight bias is perfect .
as we saw with the teacher in cody , wyoming , she seems to be affected by the law .
idiots . a couple of years ago , broward county , florida , banned running at recess .
but law is different than other kinds of uncertainties , because it carries with it the power of state .
so , what 's needed now is to rebuild these boundaries .
we have to rehumanize the law .
if teachers don 't have authority to run the classroom , to maintain order , everybody 's learning suffers .
now , i know it 's a widespread assumption in the west that as countries modernize , they also westernize .

thirteen years on , the political and legal system in hong kong is as different now as it was in 1997 .
a history of at least 2,000 years , a history of conquest , occupation , absorption , assimilation and so on , led to the process by which , over time , this notion of the han emerged -- of course , nurtured by a growing and very powerful sense of cultural identity .
this is the chinese view of the state -- very , very different to ours .
if you want to know why we unerringly seem to get china wrong -- our predictions about what 's going to happen to china are incorrect -- this is the reason .
we 've seen this in terms of the g20 usurping very rapidly the position of the g7 , or the g8 .
china already has a bigger network than any other country in the world and will soon have more than all the rest of the world put together .
christ , the chinese even invented golf .
my father gave my brother and me small luggages to carry , and we walked out and stood on the driveway waiting for our mother to come out , and when my mother finally came out , she had our baby sister in one arm , a huge duffel bag in the other , and tears were streaming down both her cheeks .

all we lack is the action to actually spend the money to put those into place .
after that , and some previous volcanoes we have , you see a quite dramatic cooling of the atmosphere .
gave a bunch of physical reasons why it wouldn 't do a very good compensation .
and that got me thinking . i 've worked on this topic on and off , but not so much technically . and i was actually lying in bed thinking one night .
finally , we could make the particles migrate to over the poles , so we could arrange the climate engineering so it really focused on the poles .
even when they 're thinking they 're just working on protecting the environment .
we have all sorts of other problems , like ocean acidification that come from co2 in the atmosphere , anyway .
i 'll leave you with three questions , and then one final quote .
but anyway , this is about the evils of science , so i think it 's perfect .
we adore babies because they 're so cute .
it wasn 't designed for chocolate cake .
our bumper sticker for this view is that this is the joy of debugging .
there 's a huge -- -- there 's a huge community of people in the world who are practical biologists , who are dog breeders , pigeon breeders , orchid breeders , rose breeders , people who handle biology with their hands , and who are dedicated to producing beautiful things , beautiful creatures , plants , animals , pets . these people will be empowered with biotech , and that will be an enormous positive step to acceptance of biotechnology .
we don 't know just how thick it is , probably miles thick , so it 's very expensive and very difficult to go down there -- send down your submarine or whatever it is -- and explore .
but better -- what is more important is that they would have to concentrate sunlight .
you take -- that 's a canadian expression .
we 're having great difficulties at the moment and any creatures that live on a planet are pretty well stuck .
thank you .
some of us do survive malaria ; we do survive aids .
and that 's my specialty , right ?
that 's mike , mike comes out from mississippi .
and we were doing open-heart surgery .
let 's go set up a company that teaches people , educates them , gives them the tools they need to keep going . "
if you compare it with what 's on the market , price-wise , size-wise , ease of use , complexity ...
i 'm going to start where the story began , 1985 , in central australia .
the aboriginal people who were our bosses and the senior people were most commonly illiterate , so the story had to be told in pictures of what were these goals .
why ? because you 're all too old .
we arrive in the morning with tools , tons of equipment , trades , and we train up a local team on the first day to start work .
and if you 've lived in australia in the last 30 years , the final cause -- you will have heard always that indigenous people trash houses .
he controls dust on mining company sites , and he came out , and within a day it worked out that most dust in this community was within a meter of the ground , the wind-driven dust , so he suggested making mounds to catch the dust before it went into the house area and affected the eyes of kids .
we were asked by a small village of 600 people to go in and make toilets where none existed .
he 's got significantly less gut infection because he 's now got toilets , and there isn 't human waste on the ground .
i think humor is a great way to celebrate our differences .
and i had every intention of taking this tribe from being outliers in the middle east and pushing them over the tipping point towards success .

20 years ago , no one had heard of it .
clearly , there are wrongs that need to be righted .
but before i do that , i want to ask if we even believe that the nonprofit sector has any serious role to play in changing the world .

in the 1990s , my company created the long distance aidsride bicycle journeys and the 60-mile-long breast cancer three-day walks , and over the course of nine years , we had 182,000 ordinary heroes participate , and they raised a total of 581 million dollars .
they knew that there was a long-term objective down the line of building market dominance .
it became this economic sanctuary where they could do penance for their profit-making tendencies at five cents on the dollar .
why ? well , the short story is , our sponsor split on us .
our generation does not want its epitaph to read , " we kept charity overhead low . "

the creative spirit in africa , the creative tradition , is as potent as it has always been , if only designers could look within .
it wasn 't until ' 79 i won my first amateur championship , and then , by ' 81 , i was 14 , and i won my first world championship , which was amazing to me , and in a very real sense , that was the first real victory i had .
so , as humbling and rotten as it was — and believe me , it was rotten . i would go to skate spots , and i was already , like , " famous guy , " right ?
it 's like skinboarding .
it 's a rotten neighborhood . your first consideration is , am i gonna get beat up ? you go out and -- see this wall ?
what makes them great is the degree to which they use their skateboarding to individuate themselves .
these are my peers .
where you 're not doing . it usurped the joy of what i loved to do because i was no longer doing it to create and have fun , and when it died out from under me , that was one of the most liberating things because i could create .

av : i don 't want to embarrass him too much . but i am going to give him three seconds .

people i interacted with daily , worked with , was friends with , family members that i had known a long time , had never shared with me their own stories .
rg : and that 's when it 's great to be running a website for parents , because we got this incredible reporter to go and interview all the scientists who conducted these four studies .
so where does that leave the two of us as a family with our three little boys in the thick of all this ?
so the point of all this for us today is not just hopefully honesty for the sake of honesty , but a hope that by being more honest and candid about these experiences , that we can all collectively bend that happiness baseline up a little bit .
here was a drag race .
why do they do it ? it 's for things like this : gene from alabama drives out there with this rocket that he 's built with x-ray sensors , video cameras , festooned with electronics , and he succeeds getting to 100,000 feet , leaving the atmosphere , seeing a thin blue line of space .
because this represents a very clean fraction of the sky .
but you go and look to the center of the galaxy , it 's thousands of years ago .

these little specks that you 're seeing in here , they 're galaxies .
and so here we are .
there are a few peaks that are a part in 10,000 , and then over billions of years , gravity just pulls in .
you can see that just from the map alone .
because the most favorite tedtalks are , on average , over 50 percent longer than the least favorite ones .

this baby is so tiny he doesn 't have enough fat on his body to stay warm .
you can open it up completely . it 's waterproof .
what makes our story especially important is that we have learned so much from a group of students who are typically not at the top of the academic ladder -- students of color , students underrepresented in selected areas .

and then finally , if you 've got the community and you 've got the high expectations and you 've got researchers producing researchers , you have to have people who are willing as faculty to get involved with those students , even in the classroom .
it means that now , not just in science and engineering , we now have programs in the arts , in the humanities , in the social sciences , in teacher education , even particularly for women in i.t.
and he kind of assumes that , yes , he 'll become -- these villagers -- he 'll become their emperor and transform their society with his wonderful command of technology and science and the elements , but , of course , realizes that without the rest of human society , he can barely make a sandwich , let alone a toaster .
and of course , it wasn 't actually a working mine anymore , because , though ray was a miner there , the mine had closed and had been reopened as a kind of tourist attraction , because , of course , it can 't compete on the scale of operations which are happening in south america , australia , wherever .
but anyway , the water i dragged back from the isle of anglesey where the mine was -- there was enough copper in it such that i could cast the pins of my metal electric plug .
and also , i thought that there would be synthetic polymers , plastics , embedded in the rock .
so basically , please don 't go and download any of the viruses that i show you .
so you 're here for one reason , and that reason is because you need your business competitors , rivals , haters , or whatever the reason is , or who , they are to go down .
you will have come in contact with some of them .
you can turn on the webcam .
what 's really insulting about this is not only does it provide the attackers with access to your data , but when the scan finishes , they tell you in order to clean up the fake viruses , you have to register the product .
so here 's a photo which resolves to st. petersburg .
that 's right , cybercriminals do have christmas parties , as it turns out .
twenty-three percent of you have been to starbucks recently and used the wireless network .

it 's one way of describing what happened with deregulation of the financial services in the u.s. and the u.k.
one scary conclusion you could draw from all of this is to worry about structural unemployment .
we can see matter . but we can 't see what 's the matter .
" not only is she aware of her physical repulsiveness , she turns it to her advantage .
but their main exercise of telepathy is to send out powerful signals to the rest of us that it doesn 't exist .

now , margaret thatcher famously said that there is nothing like a society .
we can choose to have different rating agencies .
and then you had networks that developed .
the office building is basically obsolete for doing private work .
we think of it as a compact urban cell .
but shared use is really key . if you share a vehicle , you can have at least four people use one vehicle , as opposed to one .
we hope to have that built this fall .
parking 's really expensive . it 's about 70,000 dollars per space to build a conventional parking spot inside a building .
we need shared spaces for interaction and collaboration .
or do you believe the people who tell you that aid is not going to help , on the contrary it might hurt , it might exacerbate corruption , dependence , etc . ?
is it the leeches ? is it something else ?
" not so fast , " say other people .
and i 'll give you some examples with those three questions .
so let 's try them .
now , you might say , " well , but it 's not sustainable .
so , how about the purchasing ?
so , is that sufficient ? if we think they should work intuitively , should we go for them ?
and for every hundred dollars , you get almost 30 extra years of education .
but look what we just did today .
these economics i 'm proposing , it 's like 20th century medicine .
the outrage was so swift , so voluminous , so unanimous , that the council of argyll and bute reversed themselves the same day and said , " we would , we would never censor a nine-year-old . "
that 's what happens when the media 's space expands .
and if i had to pick a group that i think is our invisible college , is our generation 's collection of people trying to take these tools and to press it into service , not for more arguments , but for better arguments , i 'd pick the open-source programmers .
but torvalds said , " no , i 'm not going to do that . "
this is the big change .
right .
there 's no democracy worth the name that doesn 't have a transparency move , but transparency is openness in only one direction , and being given a dashboard without a steering wheel has never been the core promise a democracy makes to its citizens .
this took place in my childhood -- 1957 to ' 65 .
the people who worked on it were a lot of the los alamos people who had done the hydrogen bomb work .
and this is still a very active subject .
well , here we have a little problem , the radiation doses at the crew station : 700 rads per shot .
so that 's the end . all i can say in closing is , we heard yesterday that one of the 10 bad things that could happen to us is an asteroid with our name on it .
now here at ted , we 're solving some of the great riddles of science and mysteries of the universe .
does that mean that someone 's gain has to be someone else 's loss ?
siberia most of you probably think of as a cold , desolate , unlivable place .
so let 's look at how china is re-establishing that hierarchy in the far east .
another pillar of the strategy , like russia , is demographic .
these are pipeline routes , which emerge from kurdistan , which is an oil-rich region .
these two arrows are an arc , an arc of commuter railroads and other infrastructure that link the west bank and gaza .
now it 's their oil for their own purposes .
but then eventually it grew into 12 countries , and those are the 12 stars on the european flag .
so does turkey really have to be a member of the european union ?
so denmark is about to get a whole lot smaller .
my brothers started giving me a few tips about drawing and painting .
and i just start out with a trace because i was thinking , " what really makes us ? " -- you know , it 's actually [ the ] past , what makes a person .
so i just put the paper on the focal length , which was an etching print , then i got the portrait of [ the ] sun from sunlight .
if we ask einstein , he would say , " whether the cow crossed the road , or the road moved underneath the cow , depends on your frame of reference . "
this is an exact negative .
finally , i went back to them and said , " it 's not for starting the company , it 's just to make my own work .
but she said , " no . still , i don 't like it .
so , i just started doing this work to inquire further about how to sculpt the space between this object and there .
so where it 's happening , we can see , but what is happening will remain invisible only .
i wanted to know if what we human beings see and hear and think is a full and accurate picture of reality .
i 've always been attracted to those rare people who pull that off , who devote their lives to humanity with the grit of the warrior and the grace of the mystic -- people like martin luther king , jr . , who wrote , " i can never be what i ought to be until you are what you ought to be .
now if the idea of taking any of these people to lunch makes you lose your appetite , i suggest you start more local , because there is no shortage of the other right in your own neighborhood .
i asked her why her side makes such outrageous allegations and lies about my side .
i 'll meet you there . "
since 1996 , over five million people have died in the democratic republic of the congo .
it is time to be asking questions about technology .
we demand fair trade food and fair trade clothes .
and , chris , if i could have you up here ? i have a tape measure .
and with a friend of his , he took it upon himself to free-climb a redwood without ropes or any equipment to see what was up there .
she 's , by the way , tied in with a rope so she can 't fall .
and then the trees tend to flare out into platform-like areas at the top .
and it would be a lovely thing to be able to wave to someone and have all our reiterations wave at the same time .
there are some interesting theories that , if i had time , i would tell you about .
well , i think they can tell us something about human time .
rp : caused by humans . caused by the movement of humans .
i made a lot of mistakes and dumb decisions , of course .
regret is the emotion we experience when we think that our present situation could be better or happier if we had done something different in the past .
so top six regrets -- the things we regret most in life : number one by far , education .
this is an unbelievably primitive emotional response .
but i want to suggest that there 's also a fifth one .
or you can have your last day at work .
so it 's been several years since i got my own tattoo .
but it turns out , it doesn 't remind me of the thing i thought it would ; it reminds me constantly of something else instead .
so , for instance , we have a lava lamp application here . now , you can see , i can use both of my hands to kind of squeeze together and put the blobs together . i can inject heat into the system here , or i can pull it apart with two of my fingers .
and i can bring that around , put that up there .
but as you can see , i can use the same two-fingered gestures to go down and go in really seamlessly . there 's no interface , again .
this kind of technology is going to let even more people get into it , and i 'm really looking forward to interacting with all you guys over the next few days and seeing how it can apply to your respective fields .
and so , i want to tell you about what we 've learned in doing that and four lessons i 've learned in the last year .
the second thing that we learned is that individuals matter , and they matter enormously .
in fact , policy is paramount .
he told us that brazil 's government mandated that every gasoline station in the country would carry ethanol .
and in doing so , they 'll save a million lives -- at least a million lives a year . a million lives .
second fact : the president 's new budget for renewable energy is barely a billion dollars in total .
we 've got to make this economic so that all people and all nations make the right outcome , the profitable outcome , and therefore the likely outcome .
i was a student in the ' 60s , a time of social upheaval and questioning , and -- on a personal level -- an awakening sense of idealism .
so we went to talk to the ministry of justice , and we said to the ministry of justice , what 's it worth to you if fewer of these guys re-offend ?
it was to work with 3,000 offenders split into three cohorts of 1,000 each .
the state is not a great parent .
now any entrepreneur in the room knows that version 1.0 , the business plan , is not the one that generally works .
the u.s. accounted for 79 percent of total news coverage .
in recent years , americans who say they closely follow global news most of the time grew to over 50 percent .
a huge opportunity , unleashing of new potential for innovation , for development .
this is a dust mite on a nanoreplica .
of course , migration will become even more important .
it cannot begin to cope with the challenges that this will bring .
it 's filled with lots of different things that , in short , aren 't that fun .
if you 're not , too bad . there 's nothing you can do .
and these dynamics are a little scary sometimes , because you think , you know , other people can be using forces that will manipulate how i interact : what i do , where i do it , when i do it .
this is a local company called vitality , and they 've created a product to help people take their medicine on time .
" modern warfare , " one of the most successful selling games of all time .
this is used in conventional games as well .
and they made this into a game , initially .
let 's all build it together , let 's do it well and have fun playing .
vertically , you have the time .
we need very large archives , and we need excellent specialists .
and this giant information system can be searched in many ways .
there are errors in translation , interpretative biases , and on top of that , if you add algorithmic processes , you 're going to have errors in recognition , errors in extraction , so you have very , very uncertain data .
i thank you very much .
licklider was a computer science titan who had a profound effect on the development of technology and the internet .
it displays the names of the thousands of victims using a beautiful concept called " meaningful adjacency . "
these are necessary but insufficient questions .
in october , 2007 , u.s. and coalition forces raided an al qaeda safe house in the city of sinjar on the syrian border of iraq .
one seemingly small aspect of the overall relief effort became increasingly important as the delivery of food and water started rolling .
you 're going to have to pardon the sound quality , in some cases , because again , these were hidden cameras .
and yet , despite that , the power of the situation seems to inevitably dominate , and those rich players start to eat more pretzels .
now what i want to do today is talk about some of the implications of this ideology self-interest , talk about why we should care about those implications , and end with what might be done .
so here 's an example of how we did it .
what that means is that wealth is not only becoming increasingly concentrated in the hands of a select group of individuals , but the american dream is becoming increasingly unattainable for an increasing majority of us .
so it turns out that mathematics is a very powerful language .
now in some cases math can even help explain , or propose explanations for , historical forces .
and i think that mathematics will be a very powerful language to do that .
who is the consumer , if you want , and who has responsibility for what one sees ?
the why meant really , " what consequences does it have when i take a step ? "
iceland , lower right corner , my favorite place .
if you have a waterfall in there , right out there at the horizon ; you look at the waterfall and you go , " oh , the water is falling really slowly . "
how do we create an idea which is both tolerant to individuality , and also to collectivity , without polarizing the two into two different opposites ?
should it be a more aggressive form of treatment , given that it was stage iib ?
and the more puzzles you solve , the greater the chances that you 'll win some prizes .
now you 're going to have 30 minutes to solve 15 puzzles .
how do you know that ?
and the feedback in all these cases is concrete .
i 'm a computer science professor , and my area of expertise is computer and information security .
well , in order to not have to open up the person every time you want to reprogram their device or do some diagnostics on it , they made the thing be able to communicate wirelessly , and what this research team did is they reverse engineered the wireless protocol , and they built the device you see pictured here , with a little antenna , that could talk the protocol to the device , and thus control it .
one is short-range wireless , where you can actually communicate with the device from nearby , either through bluetooth or wi-fi , and the other is long-range , where you can communicate with the car through the cellular network , or through one of the radio stations .
they were able to take over a bunch of critical computers inside the car : the brakes computer , the lighting computer , the engine , the dash , the radio , etc . , and they were able to perform these on real commercial cars that they purchased using the radio network .
it 's more of a two-way radio .
the last one i thought was really , really cool , and i just had to show it to you , it 's probably not something that you 're going to lose sleep over like the cars or the defibrillators , but it 's stealing keystrokes .
there 's several other notable attacks that unfortunately i don 't have time to go into , but the one that i wanted to point out was a group from the university of michigan which was able to take voting machines , the sequoia avc edge dres that were going to be used in new jersey in the election that were left in a hallway , and put pac-man on it .
but that 's what the rain boots are for , because rain will wash away everything , if you let it .
thank you .
when i was a freshman in high school , i was a live wire of nervous hormones .
and that was thanks to a girl in a hoodie .
at a certain point , you would realize that someone has the exact same thing , or one thing very similar , to something on your list .
you protect yourself from all the unexpected miseries or hurt that might show up .
because step three never ends .
and yet , for someone who 's apparently done this already , i still haven 't figured anything out yet .
and that is the greatest present of all .
number four and five were childhood obesity and diabetes-related issues .
and of course , these endocrine disruptors are things that are implicated in the breast cancer epidemic , the obesity epidemic , the two and a half year drop in the average age of onset of puberty in young girls and other related things .
this guy also liked plain water and the muscle relaxant .
i just want to say it was sort of a rule of thumb though , there 's about two or three fire hydrants on every city block .
it 's built as a barn raising , using open source hardware .
it 's happening all over the developed world , probably for loss of habitat , but also because our cities are a little bit more livable than they have been .
it is in your interests that i 'm healthy , happy , well-fed .
instead of doing that actually , we 've developed some fish sticks that you can feed the fish .
so , eventually i decided to pursue an mfa instead of an m.d.
it 's now an empty , six-acre lot waiting for a shopping mall right across from the new ikea .
when i was going out a lot to these places , i was feeling a lot of anxiety and isolation because i was in a solitary phase in my life , and i decided to title my series " naked city spleen , " which references charles baudelaire .
when i was there three years ago , the windows were broken and the walls were peeling , but everything was left there as it was .
this is a german bunker .
but whenever i get a chance i still work on my series .
can we find that language ?
they want positive actions they can engage in , and in their bones , they know it 's time to take personal responsibility and invest in more kindness to each other and to the environment .
so we got some land that was donated by a local garden center .
it certainly is not clever , and it 's not original .
encourage all our schools to take this seriously .
and indeed there are now thousands and thousands of models that people have contributed all over the world as part of this .
so i had no idea what it meant to fill a 3,000 square-foot gallery .
why not chisel a coral reef out of marble ?
you all have a sense of what a flat space is , euclidean space is .
does someone want to guess ?
but you don 't know what a sphere looks like .
they said , " well i guess there aren 't that many mathematicians sitting around looking at sea slugs . "
but through this sort of modality , crochet , other plastic forms of play -- people can be engaged with the most abstract , high-powered , theoretical ideas , the kinds of ideas that normally you have to go to university departments to study in higher mathematics , which is where i first learned about hyperbolic space .
female voice : long range laser scanning by sending out a pulse that 's a laser beam of light .
we also produce media for dissemination to the public -- free through the cyark website .
this includes , for example , the 3d laser scanning systems , ever more powerful personal computers , 3d graphics , high-definition digital photography , not to mention the internet .
well , i 'm staying here because we wanted to demonstrate to you the power of this technology and so , while i 've been speaking , you have been scanned .
as mahatma gandhi famously said , " you must become the change you wish to see in the world . "
this last fall , i went to the snow and ice data center in boulder , colorado , and talked to the researchers here in monterey at the naval postgraduate laboratory .
here 's the stratosphere : cooler .
people say , " what 's the solution ? " here it is .
here 's more good news . the cities supporting kyoto in the u.s.
you have no idea .
ag : i have prayed that i would be able to find the answer to that question . what can i do ?
so i want you to pay attention to what you 're doing right now .
we are also influenced by our nonverbals , our thoughts and our feelings and our physiology .
so if someone is being really powerful with us , we tend to make ourselves smaller . we don 't mirror them .
but our question really was , do our nonverbals govern how we think and feel about ourselves ?
so we have this evidence , both that the body can shape the mind , at least at the facial level , and also that role changes can shape the mind .
from their baseline when they come in , high-power people experience about a 20-percent increase , and low-power people experience about a 10-percent decrease .
it 's five minutes long . they are being recorded .
i don 't want to feel like an impostor .
you 're going to do every talk that you ever get asked to do .
two minutes , two minutes , two minutes .
the first thing that anybody who knows science , and has been around science , is that the stuff you learn in school as a scientific method is wrong . there is no method .
now , in the 17th century there was a revolution in thinking about space and time and motion and so forth of newton .
and this network of relations is ever-evolving .
that is , natural selection works on properties , like fitness , which are about relationships of some species to some other species .
and i also think that science will never go away and -- i 'm finishing on this line .
heart disease kills more women at all ages than breast cancer .
as barbara depicted in one of her amazing movies , " yentl , " she portrayed a young woman who wanted an education .
and she started , in the face of a lot of controversy , the women 's health initiative .
there 's a big clot in the middle of the artery .
he 's got a beer belly in his coronary arteries .
the syndrome , the female-pattern now is called microvascular coronary dysfunction , or obstruction .
so we hypothesized that female stem cells might be better at identifying the injury , doing some cellular repair or even producing new organs , which is one of the things that we 're trying to do with stem cell therapy .
and we 'd like to think it 's not going to take 35 years .
i also try to challenge myself to do things that doctors say are not possible .
he was underneath , not breathing for 45 minutes .
so , that clearly wasn 't going to work .
the first thing that i learned is when you 're holding your breath you should never move at all ; that wastes energy .
basically , i 'm not the best person to talk to when i 'm doing that stuff .
the world record was eight minutes and 58 seconds , held by tom sietas , that guy with the whale lungs i told you about .
a hypoxic tent is a tent that simulates altitude at 15,000 feet .
i walked into the new york times offices and did card tricks to everybody .
i spent the first five minutes underwater desperately trying to slow my heart rate down .
at 14 minutes , i had these awful contractions , like this urge to breathe .
so , i get to new york city the next day , and this kid walks up to me -- i 'm walking out of the apple store -- this kid walks up to me he 's like , " yo , d ! "
what has happened since , and what do the experts predict will happen with the number of children during this century ?
and christian majority religions , we see in these countries . they are blue .
now 1962 -- can you see they 're getting a little richer , but the number of babies per woman is falling ?
many think that afghanistan here and congo , which have suffered severe conflicts , that they don 't have fast population growth .
and you need the fourth factor , which perhaps is the most important factor .
and here , down , there are many countries which are less than two children per woman .
you can see that it 's like three billion missing here .
that 's 300 million years per minute .
we have obtained topographic measurements of the surface of mars . we understand the elevation differences .
here are some recent images .
sixteen percent , by weight , of the interior contains frozen water , or ice .
this is mars pathfinder . this is phoenix , we just put two years ago .
we fly about a mile above the surface .
this is how we do it .
and i want to show you one of our tests .
i emitted , in the atmosphere , nine tons of co2 ; that is the weight of two elephants .
now there is a new way open between atlantic and pacific .
refugee camp in darfur .
seventh we invented stories , we flew around the world , while remaining in our attic .
after many people said i couldn 't do that .
we 've managed to adapt , and have conquered the whole planet .
we know that solutions are available today .
and one of them wrote , " situation hopeless . stop .
you see , the first time , he was playing with an impulse on every note .
now , the other thing i wanted to do is to tell you about you .
amazing number of people think they 're tone-deaf .
when i started , you thought , " how beautiful that sounds . "
do you remember hamlet ? act one , scene three , he finds out that his uncle killed his father .
so this is a piece which goes from away to home .
and at the end , they went crazy , clapping . they were clapping .
if you thought , everybody loves classical music -- they just haven 't found out about it yet . "
and i say , it 's appropriate for us to ask the question , who are we being as we go back out into the world ?
because the small hadron collider once was the big thing .
we 'll grow by six cities of 12 million people a year for the next 30 years .
and there i met these two , azra on the left , maureen on the right .
ten years ago , they certainly would have been married .
many of them don 't have electricity at home .
so time and again , i found people like this .
that 's one city .
mckinsey came along and looked at his model and said , " you know what you should do with this , madhav ?
they often hit their target but miss the point .
so we certainly need more of that .
that is why we need really radical thinking , and why radical thinking is now more possible and more needed than ever in how we learn .
they can transform cities and communities .
back to back is an australian company of people with intellectual disabilities . i saw their amazing show in new york at the staten island ferry terminal at rush hour .
whole arm . shoulder disarticulation .
i put a team together , a little over 13 months ago , got up to 20 some-odd people .
it 's got 14 active degrees of freedom .
so one important environmental challenge that every system has to deal with is operating costs , just what it takes to run the system .
this is a map of the study site where i have been tracking this population of harvester ant colonies for 28 years , which is about as long as a colony lives .
but the ants are so abundant and diverse in the tropics that there 's a lot of competition .
it 's very simple .
dad talked a lot about bad design when we were growing up , you know , " bad design is just people not thinking , john , " he would say whenever a kid would be injured by a rotary lawn mower or , say , a typewriter ribbon would get tangled or an eggbeater would get jammed in the kitchen .
" doing that , acting by design , is what we all should be doing .
the poor kid , you know , has this terrified look on his face , god knows what they think .
no , no , no , no , no .
it 's a completely different domain .
but anyway , so when my wife and i decided to upgrade our early middle age -- we had four kids , after all -- with a little different technology that i won 't explain in too much detail here -- my urologist assured me i had nothing whatsoever to worry about .
we 're really hoping he thanks us for that later on .
gods we 're still fighting about . oh yeah .
i was part of this sort of background noise of the misery of zaire , completely invisible .
this is what we must demand of our lives , of our objects , of our things , of our circumstances : living with intent .
there 's the former soviet megalomaniacs .
but does it just happen over there ?
he did business with global banks .
and is this progress ? maybe , but we 're going to be keeping a very close eye on that case .
well , because there 's a lot at stake .
in the oil and mining sector , for example , there is now the beginning of a truly worldwide transparency standard that could tackle some of these problems .
it was breathtaking .
and we can then do the kinds of things that ecologists do on land , and do nearest neighbor distances .
now , this one is blue , and that 's the color of most bioluminescence in the ocean because evolution has selected for the color that travels farthest through seawater in order to optimize communication .
so , now we believe that the different shape of the lure is how the male recognizes the female in the anglerfish world , because many of these males are what are known as dwarf males .
but to me , what 's shocking is not just the amount of light , but the fact that it 's not just luciferin and luciferase .
and so , sometime ago , i got this idea for a camera system .
and i know this footage isn 't going to look like anything to you -- we had a crummy camera at the time -- but i was ecstatic .
i read about how the cpu is constantly shuffling data back and forth between the memory , the ram and the alu , the arithmetic and logic unit .
he studies the brain using mri , and he claims that this is the most beautiful brain that he has ever scanned .
it 's really a network in the literal sense of the word .
and it sits in the membrane of the cell and it 's got a pore in it .
so , we are at the stage where we don 't really know how to compute with these kinds of devices .
they want to compress the information -- they just want to send the changes , what 's new in the image , and so on -- and that is how your eyeball is able to squeeze all that information down to your optic nerve , to send to the rest of the brain .
it doesn 't light up green everywhere in the background , only on the edges , and then in the hair , and so on .
i don 't think that i would 've had that reaction , if i 'd grown up reading all this science fiction , hearing about rd2d2 , whatever it was called , and just -- you know , buying into this hype about computers .
shot straight down , so these are the shadows of the camels .
but this flashbulb memory , as it 's called , is when all the elements came together to define not just the event , but my emotional connection to it .
this is a serval cat .
annie had been killed , along with 20 members of her herd .
sometimes , though , the only way to tell a story is with a sweeping picture .
the soldier on the right has the name of his daughter tattooed across his chest , as a reminder of home .
so , she is pretty significant in size .
and one of the reasons it is so difficult is that , unlike aliens and dinosaurs , we look at human faces every day .
so , if we use information that comes off of this specular reflection , we can go from a traditional face scan that might have the gross contours of the face and the basic shape , and augment it with information that puts in all of that skin pore structure and fine wrinkles .
we actually used one of her own performances to provide the source data .
they get a bad rap .
i think we should be a bit more willing , perhaps , to look at the beautiful sight of the sunlight bursting out from behind the clouds and go , " wait a minute , that 's two cats dancing the salsa ! "
and i want to show you why , with the help of some of my favorite types of clouds .
clouds are the most egalitarian of nature 's displays , because we all have a good , fantastic view of the sky .
and it reminds us of the aimless nature of cloudspotting , what an aimless activity it is .
and i can 't complain about this .
and you think , ah hah , knowledge really is power -- the right fact deployed at exactly the right place .
people don 't realize how tough it is to write that kind of program that can read a " jeopardy " clue in a natural language like english and understand all the double meanings , the puns , the red herrings , unpack the meaning of the clue .
we were not playing in l.a. on the regular " jeopardy " set .
and i remember thinking , this is it .
and suddenly there was a machine that did that , and now we don 't need to remember that anymore .
this is terrifying because a lot of the big decisions we make require the mastery of lots of different kinds of facts .
they told the lifeguard , they went back to the hotel , and the lifeguard cleared over 100 people off the beach , luckily , because that was the day of the boxing day tsunami , the day after christmas , 2004 , that killed thousands of people in southeast asia and around the indian ocean .
i don 't want to live in a world where cultural literacy has been replaced by these little bubbles of specialty , so that none of us know about the common associations that used to bind our civilization together .
for the most part , they are just normal folks who are universally interested in the world around them , curious about everything , thirsty for this knowledge about whatever subject .
they had a " let 's build a global network " club , and it worked out very well .
so what is this bizarre architecture configuration that makes the network sing and be so unusual ?
there was a video there that the government did not like and they wanted to make sure it was blocked .
this is not a drill . it 's not just the cluelessness of youtube engineers . i promise .
suffice it to say for now that i prefer my wikipedia stir-fried with pimentos .
so what we see -- what we see in this phenomenon is something that the crazed , late traffic engineer hans monderman discovered in the netherlands , and here in south kensington , that sometimes if you remove some of the external rules and signs and everything else , you can actually end up with a safer environment in which people can function , and one in which they are more human with each other .
wow . blogs are going to change your business .
and that person taking the photo can make a decision about how and whether to respect it .
it 's a brilliant idea .
in every religious tradition , there is the outer path and the inner path , or the exoteric path and the esoteric path .
you want your employees to do what you ask them to do , and if they 've done that , then they can do extra .
jung may have called it " the subconscious . "
this is what i understand from my faith tradition , and this is what i understand from my studies of other faith traditions , and this is the common platform on which we must all stand , and when we stand on this platform as such , i am convinced that we can make a wonderful world .
and , as a psychologist , what excited me most was the idea that we would use what we learned in the virtual world about ourselves , about our identity , to live better lives in the real world .
we remove ourselves from our grief or from our revery and we go into our phones .
when i ask people " what 's wrong with having a conversation ? "
so for example , many people share with me this wish , that some day a more advanced version of siri , the digital assistant on apple 's iphone , will be more like a best friend , someone who will listen when others won 't .
and as that woman took comfort in her robot companion , i didn 't find it amazing ; i found it one of the most wrenching , complicated moments in my 15 years of work .
but more than a symptom , constant connection is changing the way people think of themselves .
when i spoke at ted in 1996 , reporting on my studies of the early virtual communities , i said , " those who make the most of their lives on the screen come to it in a spirit of self-reflection . "
i 'm optimistic .
basically , if we think about language , language has existed for perhaps 150,000 years , at least 80,000 years , and what it arose as is speech . people talked .
so i mean the kind of speech that you see someone giving in an old movie where they clear their throat , and they go , " ahem , ladies and gentlemen , " and then they speak in a certain way which has nothing to do with casual speech .
and it 's a very interesting thing , but nevertheless easy to think that still it represents some sort of decline .
this julie says , " so what 's up ? "
the slash is interesting .
1841 , some long-lost superintendent of schools is upset because of what he has for a long time " noted with regret the almost entire neglect of the original " blah blah blah blah blah .
is e.t. out there ?
but drake 's idea here became very popular because it was very appealing — and i 'll get back to that — and on the basis of this experiment , which didn 't succeed , we have been doing seti ever since , not continuously , but ever since .
they don 't really know what exponential means , but this is exponential .
i mean , who knows , but suppose it happens .
they 're not building transmitters .
i also think that exploration is important in terms of being able to address what i think is a critical lack in our society , and that is the lack of science literacy , the lack of the ability to even understand science .
and i bet the answer you 're going to get , is , " well , i don 't know what the higgs boson is , and i don 't know if it 's important . "
now it 's my theory , supported only by anecdotal , personal anecdotal evidence , but nonetheless , that kids get interested in something between the ages of eight and 11 . you 've got to get them there .
let me just say , look , my job is a privilege because we 're in a special time .
that 's interference . communication requires sending and receiving , and i have another whole tedtalk about the importance of conscious listening , but i can send as well as i like , and you can be brilliant conscious listeners .
but i think sometimes they don 't use them when they 're designing buildings . here 's a case in point .
then you have children for whom english is a second language , or whatever they 're being taught in is a second language .
out of that conference , incidentally , also came a free app which is designed to help children study if they 're having to work at home , for example , in a noisy kitchen .
thank you .
probably what happened is a hospital in japan upgraded their equipment and donated their old stuff to nepal .
so really i want to design for outcomes .
this is an american foundation that distributes that technology to poor hospitals around that region .
here 's what it looks like under actual use .
they 've treated 50,000 kids in vietnam with this technology .
in other words , you want to make the right way to use it the easiest way to use it .
we have to ask ourselves hard questions .
but now we have a new situation , really what people call an asymmetric situation , where technology is so powerful that it extends beyond a nation-state .
and then i signed a book contract to write more gloomy thoughts about this and moved into a hotel room in new york with one room full of books on the plague , and you know , nuclear bombs exploding in new york where i would be within the circle , and so on .
and that is to say that there 's a lot of legs left in moore 's law .
but these new materials bring such incredible innovations that there 's a strong basis for hope that these things will be so profitable that they can be brought to the market .
so inside of a nanotube , we 're really at the limit here .
we 've got to be able to make the rapid diagnostics quickly .
how could you keep the law ?
customer : uh , let 's see .
i built my first website myself in html , and i 'm learning javascript and python .
now i didn 't have any business plans at only eight years old .
it takes to get it through your hearts , because when you get it through your heart , that is when movements are sparked .
finding deep resonances with other religions and philosophies and ways of looking at life as part of what is a universal and global search for meaning .
and if this is true , it must also be that god knows the joy and exaltation of the human spirit , as well .
in the second verse comes the line , " the wind and waves obey him . "
a cosmic us and them , and a god who is guilty of the worst kind of favoritism ?
maybe god doesn 't do things at all .
it 's hard to conceive , and begs more questions .
by seeking the inwardness which is in all things .
fn : and i brought this all together , this passion with alternative energy and raced a solar car across australia -- also the u.s. and japan .
and i thought to myself , " but that 's what i want to do .
when i was in high school , i got my first philips reel-to-reel tape recorder , and tape recorders became my sort of pre-computer medium of learning .
it 's a keynote gold 84k , and the 84k stands for it had 84 kilobytes of memory .
i can keep up with my friends .
but i wouldn 't give up the technology , because it 's allowed me to lead a great life .
i want that to happen .
how would you do it ?
the bright stars correspond to little daggers on the rete .
and it 's worth probably about three macbook pros .
so , i know what you 're thinking : " that 's a lot of work , isn 't it ? isn 't it a ton of work to be able to tell the time ? "
and the astrolabes come in many different sizes and shapes and forms .
so , it 's -- i think astrolabes are just remarkable devices .
but what i 'd like to show you today is a means by which we might get not just rapid warning about an epidemic , but also actually early detection of an epidemic .
for instance , sexually transmitted diseases will spread across sexual ties .
on the left-hand panel , again , we have the s-shaped curve of adoption .
so , we thought we would exploit this idea in order to study whether we could predict phenomena within networks .
so , this is a map of 714 students and their friendship ties .
so , if we have a population of a thousand people , and we want to make the population immune to a pathogen , we don 't have to immunize every single person .
they 're all kinds of ways we can use massively collected data to create sensor networks to follow the population , understand what 's happening in the population , and intervene in the population for the better .
but now we have access to these kinds of data that allow us to understand social processes and social phenomena in an entirely new way that was never before possible .
it allows us to reach back into our long-term memory and pull some of that in as we need it , mixes it , processes it in light of whatever our current goal is .
just shout it out .
it allows us to problem-solve , critical think .
all of that talks about working memory , what we can do and what we can 't do .
we want to take all of our existence and wrap it around that new knowledge and make all of these connections and it becomes more meaningful .
i have been blown away by this conference , and i want to thank all of you for the many nice comments about what i had to say the other night .
the very next day , continuing a totally true story , i got on a g-5 to fly to africa to make a speech in nigeria , in the city of lagos , on the topic of energy .
it 's like beachcombing , you know ? every time the tide comes in and out , you find some more shells .
be a green consumer . you have choices with everything you buy , between things that have a harsh effect or a much less harsh effect on the global climate crisis .
working with larry lessig , it will be , somewhere in that process , posted with tools and limited-use copyrights , so that young people can remix it and do it in their own way .
thank you very much , i appreciate it .
what kinds of people would join a global community welcoming people from every discipline and culture , who seek a deeper understanding of the world , and who hope to turn that understanding into a better future for us all ?
you can either take the blue pill and stick to your comforting delusions , or you can take the red pill , learn some moral psychology and step outside the moral matrix .
we 're all mammals here , we all have a lot of neural and hormonal programming that makes us really bond with others , care for others , feel compassion for others , especially the weak and vulnerable .
it 's about any kind of ideology , any kind of idea that tells you that you can attain virtue by controlling what you do with your body , by controlling what you put into your body .
liberals are basically saying , " no , this is not morality .
if you 're conservative , and you learn that a dog 's extremely loyal to its home and family , and doesn 't warm up quickly to strangers , for conservatives , well , loyalty is good -- dogs ought to be loyal .
on the first round , people give about half of the money that they can .
this is what 's really complicated , that there were people living in places like the grand canyon , cooperating with each other , or on the savannahs of africa , or on the frozen shores of alaska , and then some of these villages grew into the mighty cities of babylon , and rome , and tenochtitlan .
the great conservative insight is that order is really hard to achieve .
but before you feel superior to george bush , before you throw a stone , ask yourself , do you accept this ?
but there is also a passionate commitment to the truth .
it must be really extraordinary , an exception to the rule .
i 've been digging through the literature for the original reference for that number , and i could never find it .
the human brain is not a large rat brain .
we calculated on the one hand how much energy a primate gets per day from eating raw foods , and on the other hand , how much energy a body of a certain size costs and how much energy a brain of a certain number of neurons costs , and we looked for the combinations of body size and number of brain neurons that a primate could afford if it ate a certain number of hours per day .
with this large brain now affordable by cooking , we went rapidly from raw foods to culture , agriculture , civilization , grocery stores , electricity , refrigerators , all of those things that nowadays allow us to get all the energy we need for the whole day in a single sitting at your favorite fast food joint .
" one bite , adam . don 't abandon eve . "
they were self-confident and determined . and the key for me today , the key for you , is , they were future-focused rather than present-focused .
well there is actually six of them . there are two ways to be present-oriented .
i 'm sure that resonates with some of the tedsters .
at first , living in the van was great .
i parked a different place every night so i would avoid being noticed and hassled by the police .
and when i realized that tim russert , former moderator of " meet the press , " was talking about my writing , while i was living in a van in a wal-mart parking lot , i started laughing .
and i 'm not here to be the poster girl for the homeless .
i 've been a civil servant , and i 've been in charge of policy for this guy as well .
and i think one of the lessons of history is that even the deepest crises can be moments of opportunity .
and , after all this , as the great chinese sage lao tzu said , " governing a great country is like cooking a small fish .
now , i didn 't really understand that until i met this guy who was then an 80-year-old , slightly shambolic man who lived on tomato soup and thought ironing was very overrated .
and just a few months ago , president obama launched the office of social innovation in the white house .
even fidel castro now says that the only thing worse than being exploited by multinational capitalism is not being exploited by multinational capitalism .
i was not born with a blade in my hand .
but to me , they are fascinating objects to visually narrate a story .
and i 'm making all those kinds of windows .
it 's a non-sugar-coated history of sugar .
one story leads to another .
and then you have all those individual stories where sometimes we even have the same action , and the result puts you in hells or in heavens .
and i entered competitions for a long time .
i took library material that had fruit in their title and i used them to make an orchard walk with these fruits of knowledge .
and in 2009 , i was asked to make a poster to be placed in the subway cars in new york city for a year .
now i hope all of you feel better .
now you can also see , if i turn this around here -- hopefully i won 't shake the world too much .
i mean , it could be somebody 's health , it could be somebody 's career , something important to them .
now does anybody know who this is ?
and now we 've grown to over 100,000 members .
so it 'd be like three people , or something like that , and they would try to make a product .
raise your hands .
i just wanted to show quickly .
i don 't have to do my other job now . "
and he read this , and he thought a person had decided that he was boring , and it was very unfortunate , and he said , " you know , what are these , you know , bastards at google doing ?
some of those reforms have been good .
he said you ought to just throw in a few simple things , like seeking first to understand as opposed to being understood , simple things like apologizing .
and i gave them a saying to say : " i am somebody .
for years i watched my mother take the time at recess to review , go on home visits in the afternoon , buy combs and brushes and peanut butter and crackers to put in her desk drawer for kids that needed to eat , and a washcloth and some soap for the kids who didn 't smell so good .
but it is not impossible .
i 'm from edinburgh . worse news , that 's even edinburgh .
it 's not the only reason preventing heart disease .
we thought that maybe nitric oxide affected cell death , and how cells survive , and their resistance to other things .
so we put patients with these subjects under the uv , and their no levels do go up , and their blood pressure goes down .
there is no change in blood flow , in dilatation of the blood vessels .
we think it 's very important .
so after about a month of being incredibly frustrated , i walked down into a conference room that was filled with detectives and stacks and stacks of case files , and the detectives were sitting there with yellow legal pads taking notes .
and what i learned very quickly is that we weren 't doing a good job .
they haven 't yet been convicted of a crime .
and at the other end of the spectrum , we 're doing an equally terrible job .
second , for the first time , and i think this is incredibly important , we can predict whether someone will commit an act of violence if they 're released .
some people call it data science .
we have the animals that are able to live and to sense , and on the top of the pyramid , there is the man .
they have just a kind of very low-level soul .
so during the night , they curl the leaves and reduce the movement , and during the day , you have the opening of the leaves -- there is much more movement .
in his book , assisted by his son , francis -- who was the first professor of plant physiology in the world , in cambridge -- they took into consideration every single movement for 500 pages .
because they evolved for the same reason : to survive predation .
well , thank you for your attention .
we can only see six men in this picture , but in fact , those who are hidden here are all people who were laid off . they have just been made invisible .
lb : this is the borghese gallery in rome .
if an artwork is to touch someone , it must be the result of not only technique , but also the artist 's thinking and struggle in life .
will geeks become endangered species ?
yossi vardi : this is one of the most popular viral advertisement of last year , known as the optical inch by philips . let 's applaud philips -- -- for this gesture for humanity .
but those who revolted shared a common set of grievances and have similar demands today .
among the most frequent responses was liberty and justice .
i was meeting with a group of newly-elected parliamentarians from egypt and tunisia a couple of weeks ago .
in the country once known for its passive resignation , where , as bad as things got , only four percent expressed their opinion to a public official , today 90 percent tell us that if there 's a problem in their community , it 's up to them to fix it .
and the transformation continues .
who should get the best ones ?
we 'll all be better off if good music is played rather than terrible music .
he sued , and his case went all the way to the supreme court , believe it or not , the case over the golf cart , because the law says that the disabled must be accommodated , provided the accommodation does not change the essential nature of the activity .
audience : the cart 's not part of the game .
warren , are you a golfer ?
now , there were two dissenters , one of whom was justice scalia .
let me put the point as delicately as possible : golfers are a little sensitive about the athletic status of their game .
thank you .
five hundred seventy-one million two hundred thirty thousand pounds of paper towels are used by americans every year .
audience : shake . fold .
it 's smart enough to stop .
and along the way , we became a city of innovation .
now you know the lists i 'm talking about .
but it all seemed fairly normal , going through it .
well , that 's when all hell broke loose .
we put some investments on the river that had originally been invested upon in the original maps , and now we are currently in the final stages of developing the finest venue in the world for the sports of canoe , kayak and rowing .
our state health statistics are doing better .
this one i thought i 'd show you .
it 's not very appropriate to do it now . some people tell me to do it ; i think , well , that 's not really proper , you know , these days .
charles elachi : now , moving from the play stuff to the serious stuff , always people ask , why do we explore ?
six to nine months at the right time of the year .
as i told you , geologists love craters .
so let me go on the next short video .
that 's what we call the seven minutes of terror .
richard kornfeld : there is this window of opportunity within which we can deploy the parachute .
we have to build large amounts of autonomy into the spacecraft so that it can land itself safely .
so just imagine : you take your p.c. and throw it into a nuclear reactor and it still has to work .
hopefully it all will work , you know , it will work that way .
and you see the amount of detail that is in those rings , which are the particles .
that was [ unclear ] also -- you know , because we were worried about the risk of it , but it worked pretty well .
you just drive to the nearest lake , stick your hose in it , and you 've got your car filled up .
now , in order for us to examine the overall impact of a health condition both on life expectancy as well as on the quality of life lived , we need to use a metric called the daly , which stands for a disability-adjusted life year .
this was a reality of a world in which there were almost no mental health professionals at all .
we need to deliver health care , not in large institutions , but close to people 's homes , and we need to deliver health care using whoever is available and affordable in our local communities .
but on the other side of that , though , we were big readers in our house .
so amongst all the criteria i have , there 's two main things .
so i should start to talk about these guys .
the next artist is kay overstry , and she 's interested in ephemerality and transience .
which is one of the best compliments ever .
sylvia 's interested in art training .
and so we got to the grave and made this , which was hilarious -- the attention that we got .
hazel clausen is an anthropologist who took a sabbatical and decided , " you know , i would learn a lot about culture if i created a culture that doesn 't exist from scratch . "
next is roy penig , a really interesting kentucky artist , and he 's the nicest guy .
next , this is by thomas swifton .
my grandmother was a chemist . she worked at the banting institute in toronto , and at 44 she died of stomach cancer . i never met my grandmother , but i carry on her name -- her exact name , eva vertes -- and i like to think i carry on her scientific passion , too .
and so i thought , " maybe if it can promote cell growth , it can inhibit cell death , too . "
but it 's almost as if the body has originated this ingenious response , but can 't quite control it .
so these articles were saying , you know , " skeletal -- metastasis to skeletal muscle -- is very rare . "
we use skeletal muscles so much . it 's the one portion of our body -- our heart 's always beating . we 're always moving our muscles .
if every time we tore a muscle or every time we stretched a muscle or moved in a wrong way , cancer occurred -- i mean , everybody would have cancer almost .
and i walked up to the bedside of an old woman who was breathing very rapidly , fragile , obviously in the latter phase of active dying .
they have touched me throughout my 68 years .
it is there within every human being .
but compassion , the generation of compassion , actually mobilizes our immunity .
but the other side of the equation is you 've got to come out of your cave .
most of you know me from my palm and handspring days , but i also run a nonprofit scientific research institute called the redwood neuroscience institute in menlo park , and we study theoretical neuroscience , and we study how the neocortex works .
he didn 't say we didn 't even have a theory . he says , we don 't even know how to begin to think about it -- we don 't even have a framework .
so why should we have a good brain theory ?
this works in physics . this works in geology . but if this is normal science , what does neuroscience look like ? this is what neuroscience looks like .
that 's always been the case . and so all we can say , well , my neocortex , which is the part of the brain i 'm interested in , has 30 billion cells .
first of all , they had a lot of unexplained data . a lot of it .
now i 'm going to tell it to you , and it 's going to seem obvious that that is correct , and that 's the point , right ? then i 'm going to have to make an argument why you 're incorrect about the other assumption .
well i 'll argue a non-intelligent brain , we got hold of an old brain , and we 're going to say it 's like a non-mammal , like a reptile , so i 'll say , an alligator ; we have an alligator .
it 's sitting there saying , ah , i 'm going to memorize all the things that are going on : where i 've been , people i 've seen , things i 've heard , and so on .
it may take a second to figure out what it was , but something happened .
we test it by prediction . what is the next word in this , you know ?
not like computer memory . it 's not at all like computer memory .
so the first thing we 're going to do are the things that don 't require a lot of robotics .
the question that was being asked of me was a different one , which was , did she also need an amputation ?
yet when it came to a disease like diabetes that kills americans eight times more frequently than melanoma , i never once questioned the conventional wisdom .
now , most researchers believe obesity is the cause of insulin resistance .
getting the cause and the effect right makes all the difference in the world .
now , we know that refined grains and starches elevate your blood sugar in the short run , and there 's even reason to believe that sugar may lead to insulin resistance directly .
second , based on these insights , can people make the necessary changes in their diets in a way that 's safe and practical to implement ?
i come to you with a modest proposal for easing the financial burden .
a thin film will creep up the inside wall , flow over the top and right out the outside .
the most surprising thing that i 've learned while running this contest is that some scientists are now working directly with dancers on their research .
one idea is to drastically reduce public support for the arts .
one of the big things about countering terrorism is , how do you perceive it ?
the consumers it needs are the terrorist constituency .
now , staying on this brand thing for just a few more seconds , think about delivery mechanisms .
the father will probably kick himself for years to come that he didn 't take that seat instead of his kid .
the fear and the pressure to do something on them is going to be immense . they are going to make mistakes .
when we originally looked at bringing civil actions against terrorists , everyone thought we were a bit mad and mavericks and crackpots . now it 's got a title . everyone 's doing it .
civil affairs and civil society initiatives .
the role we could do right now is going away and looking at how we can support victims around the world to bring initiatives .
in that way , sitting has become the smoking of our generation .
you 'll be surprised at how fresh air drives fresh thinking , and in the way that you do , you 'll bring into your life an entirely new set of ideas .
the beijing olympics were an exercise in chinese soft power .
if you were lucky enough to be a wealthy businessman or an influential journalist , or a doctor or something , you might have a telephone .
and he whipped out his cellphone , dialed the number , and a voice said , " i 'm up here . "
afghanistan , we know what a serious security problem afghanistan is for so many of us in the world .
today , people in silicon valley and elsewhere speak of the iits , the indian institutes of technology with the same reverence they used to accord to mit .
all the others have been all those three .
now , that is the india that is emerging into the 21st century .
and so that year , i started to build this robot , kismet , the world 's first social robot .
he 's very bad , leo .
there 's actually a scientist carefully controlling nexi 's cues to be able to study this question .
and you get even more of a boost when you add the full expression .
and it was designed to be a robot diet-and-exercise coach .
it turns out that people interacted with the robot significantly more , even though the quality of the advice was identical to the computer .
so changes that children make in the real world need to translate to the virtual world .
now when we think of our senses , we don 't usually think of the reasons why they probably evolved , from a biological perspective .
now if you had to pick a sense to lose , i have to be very honest with you and say , we 're better at restoring hearing than we are at restoring any sense that there is .
back then you couldn 't even look at the eardrum .
jn : i see . and who is that ?
music is entirely different .
but it certainly wasn 't the way the music was intended .
i had patients tell me that those sound the same .
i 'm suggesting that with training you can imbue a musical sound with significance , even in a cat .
truth of the matter is you can play the piano without a cochlear implant , because all you have to do is press the keys at the right time .
these are my buildings .
now , one in three people living in cities today actually live in a slum .
one cubic meter of wood will store one tonne of carbon dioxide .
fair enough .
we 're at the beginning of a revolution , i hope , in the way we build , because this is the first new way to build a skyscraper in probably 100 years or more .
what is possible with the human voice ?
this system has -- thank you , beautiful assistant -- this system has no sounds in it itself until i start putting sounds in it , so there 's no prerecorded samples of any kind .
but what if i wanted to sound like the whole of pink floyd ?
and as an inorganic chemist , my friends and colleagues make this distinction between the organic , living world and the inorganic , dead world .
is matter evolvable ?
and this is really the question .
chemists are trying to study the molecules to look at disease .
evolution kicked in -- and that 's the cool bit .
so what we 're trying to do is do reactions -- not in one flask , but in tens of flasks , and connect them together , as you can see with this flow system , all these pipes .
and so with this lego kit , we have the diversity required for complex information storage without dna .
so you imagine , if we 're able to create a self-sustaining artificial life form , not only will this tell us about the origin of life -- that it 's possible that the universe doesn 't need carbon to be alive ; it can use anything -- we can then take [ it ] one step further and develop new technologies , because we can then use software control for evolution to code in .
and again , when you 're thinking about how improbable this is , remember , five billion years ago , we were not here , and there was no life .
don 't go and look for carbon , go and look for evolvable stuff .
anthropologists have found evidence of romantic love in 170 societies .
my body is numb with grief .
somebody is camping in your head .
and indeed , it 's this part of the brain , the core of the nucleus accumbens , actually , that is becoming active as you 're measuring your gains and losses .
it 's been about eight months , she 's beginning to feel better .
we 've put five people in so far , and indeed , we found exactly the same thing . they 're not lying .
i think there 's biology to that .
this was my mental model of the world : exploding population , small planet ; it 's going to lead to ugly things .
all of the western religions begin with the notion of eden , and descend through a kind of profligate present to a very ugly future .
so i 'm going to briefly discuss a couple of problems that we have and a couple of problems where we 've got some solutions underway .
so a simple idea , which we hope is going to change the way vaccines are distributed in africa and around the world .
now , malaria is an incredibly complicated disease .
so here 's an image of red blood cells , and now we can actually map where the hemozoin and where the malaria parasites are inside those red blood cells .
ultimately , it gives you this .
well , let 's try to kill it with consumer electronics . "
now , it turns out we only kill the female mosquitoes .
so you may be able to hear some mosquitoes flying around .
these african students are doing their homework under streetlights at the airport in the capital city because they don 't have any electricity at home .
are there some rules we can develop for changing rules ?
it 's not just that the rules are bad because the government is too strong and oppressive , as in north korea .
hong kong was also the model which leaders like deng xiaoping could copy , when they decided to move all of the mainland towards the market model .
and you 'll need to attract families , the residents who will come and live there permanently , raise their children , get an education for their children , and get their first job .
this model is all about choices , both for leaders and for the people who will live in these new places .
it 's a way to create new rules , and let people opt-in without coercion , and the opposition that coercion can force .
it would help to have a manual .
when we think about ideas in that way , we usually think about technologies .
it is asset optimization and system optimization .
just in the u.s. , a system like this can prevent over 60,000 delays and cancellations every year , helping seven million passengers get to their destinations on time .
and if she faces an unexpected issue , the same handheld device will allow her to communicate with colleagues at the service center , let them see what she sees , transmit data that they can run through diagnostics , and they can stream videos that will guide her , step by step , through whatever complex procedure is needed to get the machines back up and running .
and every time i hear this , i can 't help thinking that even back in the stone age , there must have been a group of cavemen sitting around a fire one day looking very grumpy , and looking disapprovingly at another group of cavemen rolling a stone wheel up and down a hill , and saying to each other , " yeah , this wheel thing , cool toy , sure , but compared to fire , it will have no impact .
thank you .
just like in language and other domains , we know that it 's hard for people to parse very complex sentences with a kind of recursive structure .
but they lose , right ?
now if you were to step back and say , " what can we do with this information ? "
we have some other data where they play across computers .
this is from the first two seconds .
so this is an amazing memory test from nagoya , japan , primate research institute , where they 've done a lot of this research .
they 're going to press left or right .
what about humans ? you think you 're smarter than a chimpanzee ?
to give you a quick primer on where we are , a quick refresher on where we are .
why don 't we lower both lines ?
so when we 're talking about cutting government spending , this is the pie we 're talking about , and americans overwhelmingly , and it doesn 't matter what party they 're in , overwhelmingly like that big 55 percent chunk .
now when it comes to taxes , there is more disagreement .
the vast majority of economists -- it is so uncool to call yourself an ideologue of either camp .
think of it as a tiny , tiny number of ancient economists and misrepresentative ideologues have captured the process .
thank you .
it is fatty , it 's sweet , it 's silky , it 's unctuous .
big , big problem .
you know , foie gras by definition , force feeding , it 's gavage , and that 's what you get when you want foie gras .
and amazingly , the geese who were on the other side of the paddock when i was around -- " get the hell away from this kid ! " -- when i lowered my voice , they all came right up to us .
it really is the garden of eden .
well , because he doesn 't force feed , because he doesn 't gavage tons of corn , his livers were pretty grey .
" shush , " he says again for the 500th time to me .
to happiness .
it was sweet , it was unctuous .
and it may be because of the wine , or it may be because of my excitement , he answered me directly and he said , " because chefs don 't deserve my foie gras . "
jews invented foie gras .
that 's the history of foie gras .
and stop degrading resources under the guise of cheap food .
and then , not only for war victims , but it was for any kind of patient .
i wanted to go home . i was driving .
we will provide you with a pair of legs . "
i said , " no .
i was working , i was going everyday to work for the homeless .
two groups of mujahideen started fighting .
i asked about his son .
he said , " i am a scrap of a man , but if you help me , i 'm ready to do anything , even if i have to crawl on the ground . "
i told najmuddin , " that 's a trick .
but also for the newcomers .
i have a wish , a big wish , that this way of working , this way of thinking , is going to be implemented in other countries .
well i don 't know yet , but i 'm sure najmuddin and his friends , they have it already in mind .
i tried to convince myself that , " no , no , i have worked for the policy changes .
or of indian councils of science research do not require that whatever you learn from people , you must share back with them .
is this a beautiful picture or is it a terrible picture ?
so honey bee network builds upon the resource in which poor people are rich .
so on the wayside we found these dung cakes , which are used as a fuel .
a lot of poor people do not have enough grains to get ground .
now , what is the beauty in it ?
for example , cell phones : we have 400 million cellphones in this country .
ag : saidulluh sahib is in motihari , again in champaran .
this innovation is from the slums of rio .
there 's a whole range of innovations that we have .
i 'm here to talk to you about the economic invisibility of nature .
a picture that you 're familiar with -- the amazon rainforests .
and that brings me to another aspect of this , which is , to whom should this get paid ?
now i 'm going to show you how business as usual will affect this .
and they calculated for the top 3,000 corporations , what are the externalities ?
and the world bank has acknowledged this and they 've started a project called waves -- wealth accounting and valuation of ecosystem services .
we are measuring it because we know that you cannot manage what you do not measure . "
in fact , what 's being absorbed is something like 25 percent of our emissions , which then leads to acidification or lower alkalinity in oceans .
i don 't think we can afford too much of such ethical choices .
so it turned out that my fantasy about an entertaining life of being the karmapa wasn 't going to come true .
so it 's an interesting paradox at play there .
and i think that sometimes we develop grand concepts of what happiness might look like for us , but that , if we pay attention , we can see that there are little symbols of happiness in every breath that we take .
what 's going on in the u.s. government ?
it is comprised of students . there are something like 300 anti-genocide chapters on college campuses around the country .
for instance , the referral of the crimes in darfur to the international criminal court , which the bush administration doesn 't like .
why would we expect in a bureaucracy that it would orient itself towards distant suffering ?
what he was was a decathlete of nation-building , of problem-solving , of troubleshooting in the world 's worst places and in the world 's most broken places .
he then goes to rwanda and to congo in the aftermath of the genocide , and he 's the guy who has to decide -- huh , ok , the genocide is over ; 800,000 people have been killed ; the people responsible are fleeing into neighboring countries -- into congo , into tanzania .
one note on his death , which is so devastating , is that despite predicating the war on iraq on a link between saddam hussein and terrorism in 9 / 11 , believe it or not , the bush administration or the invaders did no planning , no pre-war planning , to respond to terrorism .
and they would laugh at him because he didn 't have the power of states , the power of any military or police .
if we think about dignity in our conduct as citizens and as individuals with relation to the people around us , and as a country , if we could inject a regard for dignity into our dealings with other countries , it would be something of a revolution .
i think the short answer is : no , not unless we let it .
and i think that one of the reasons why so many of these groups have retained a link to the past , know their native languages , the songs , the dances , the traditions , i think part of that reason is because of the remoteness , the span and the wilderness of this almost 95 percent intact ecosystem .
and this is just one of a number of mines , 10 mines so far right now .
that 's like from wall street at the southern edge of manhattan up to maybe 120th street .
and what we 're doing is we 're destroying this carbon sink , turning it into a carbon bomb .
some of the greatest densities of , some of the most iconic and threatened species on the planet , and yet there 's a proposal , of course , to build a pipeline to take huge tankers , 10 times the size of the exxon valdez , through some of the most difficult to navigate waters in the world , where only just a few years ago , a b.c. ferry ran aground .
it could destroy the great bear rainforest , the largest temperate rainforest in the world .
hold on .
well , i didn 't deceive you .
and i don 't know what you expect , but when i was thinking about that issue , i early on realized what i 'm not able to give you are answers .
it 's better if you care about learning something .
we can question : is it a good thing that all of us continuously self-optimize ourselves to fit better into that society ?
our designs are not ethical or unethical in that they 're using ethical or unethical means of persuading us .
because , again , it communicates an idea of the good life .
and with that , i thank you .
it 's a little brain worm .
yesterday , amory lovins spoke about " infectious repititis . "
now , what theories do we want to use to look at this ?
yesterday , negroponte was talking about viral telecommunications but -- what 's a virus ?
they survived as long as they did at a time when the social safety nets weren 't there .
and i agree . it is largely wonderful . largely wonderful .
if you 've had a friend who 's died of aids , then you hate hiv .
it looked at the intersection of race and gender in contemporary american art .
in some cases , i know that many of you are involved in cross-cultural dialogues , you 're involved in ideas of creativity and innovation .
really , most exciting about this is thinking about the energy and the excitement that young artists can bring .
thank you .
what this means is that for the first time since the industrial revolution , the most important means , the most important components of the core economic activities -- remember , we are in an information economy -- of the most advanced economies , and there more than anywhere else , are in the hands of the population at large . this is completely different than what we 've seen since the industrial revolution . so we 've got communications and computation capacity in the hands of the entire population , and we 've got human creativity , human wisdom , human experience -- the other major experience , the other major input -- which unlike simple labor -- stand here turning this lever all day long -- is not something that 's the same or fungible among people .
the critical innovation here is instead of our engineers , or our people saying which is the most relevant , we 're going to go out and count what you , people out there on the web , for whatever reason -- vanity , pleasure -- produced links , and tied to each other . we 're going to count those , and count them up .
what characterizes them is decentralized authority .
instead of building well-behaved appliances -- things that you know what they 'll do in advance -- you begin to build more open tools . there 's a new set of values , a new set of things people value .
and that 's exactly what cricket has done .
take a look : you could play it in the dump with some rocks over there , you could play it in a little alley -- you couldn 't hit square anywhere , because the bat hit the wall ; don 't forget the air conditioning and the cable wires .
and so cricket started becoming big ; cricket started bringing riches in .
a massive , massive success : india , the world tt champions .
it was never promoted , it was never sold -- it was organized .
now , all of the sudden , if you were to bowl a shot -- if mumbai were to bowl a shot , for example , they needn 't go to kalbadevi or shivaji park or somewhere to source them , they could go to trinidad .
and so it started resembling the indian movies more and more .
there it is .
now , this last minute before i go -- there 's a couple of side effects of all this .
we know much less about their treatment and the understanding of their basic mechanisms than we do about diseases of the body .
otherwise , we 're going to keep pouring oil all over our mental engines and suffering the consequences .
well , one of the ways that we can start is to try to come up with some general characteristics or properties of emotion-like states such as arousal , and see if we can identify any fly behaviors that might exhibit some of those properties .
dopamine plays a number of important functions in the brain , including in attention , arousal , reward , and disorders of the dopamine system have been linked to a number of mental disorders including drug abuse , parkinson 's disease , and adhd .
but it could equally be the case that it 's the learning disabilities that cause the hyperactivity .
and so it was great fun in those days , and some of those of you who are in the audience were my clients .
it 's kind of like architects who show people in their houses , as opposed to them being empty .
i don 't know if anybody 's seen this -- it 's pretty spectacular in the room .
s so far it 's chaos , but a lot of people are doing stuff , so that 's good .
it 's called spyfish , and it 's a company called h2eye , started by nigel jagger in london .
and to this date -- he 's been gone for only a few years -- he 's started 19,000 companies .
all stories interest me , and some haunt me until i end up writing them .
however , what matters most -- more than training or luck -- is the heart .
but so did most of the flag-bearers , except sophia loren , the universal symbol of beauty and passion .
so here 's a tale of passion .
no wonder that by age five i was a raging feminist -- although the term had not reached chile yet , so nobody knew what the heck was wrong with me .
the first patient is in excruciating pain because she has several rotten molars .
if a woman is empowered , her children and her family will be better off .
they are huge paintings of torture and abuse of power , in the voluminous botero style .
let 's get off our fannies , roll up our sleeves and get to work , passionately , in creating an almost perfect world .
25 days : heart chamber developing 32 days : arms & amp ; hands are developing 36 days : beginning of the primitive vertabrae these weeks are the period of the most rapid development of the fetus .
take a look at this little tuft of capillaries .
when i 'm wearing fresh gear i don 't have to hide , and i really must get some new gear soon or my ego will pop like a 10-cent balloon .
he was coughing , crying , blood spilled on the street .
i mean , i thought poetry was just self-expression .
method acting is nothing but a mixture of multiple personalities , believing your own lies are reality , like in high school cool kenny telling me he wanted to be a cop .
reaching success , i was pretty good at coming up with good ideas .
and yeah , the black cloud faded a little bit , but so did all the work , because i was just floating along . i couldn 't care less if clients ever called .
and if we want to avoid " success-to-failure-syndrome , " we just keep following these eight principles , because that is not only how we achieve success , it 's how we sustain it .
manufacturers haven 't built this carrier phase technique into their cheap gps chips because they 're not sure what the general public would do with geolocation so accurate that you could pinpoint the wrinkles in the palm of your hand .
now , of course , there is a flip side to the gps dot .
the supreme court ruled last month that a policeman has to get a warrant if he wants to do prolonged tracking , but the law isn 't clear about civilians doing this to one another , so it 's not just big brother we have to worry about , but big neighbor .
we 're almost blindly reliant on it .
they 're wide open , vulnerable to a kind of spoofing attack .
you can scarcely imagine the kind of havoc you could cause if you knew what you were doing with a gps spoofer .
so that in one generation , we 're going to halve our cultural diversity .
so i was in dharamsala meeting these people , and i 'd spent about five weeks there , and i was hearing these similar stories of these refugees that had poured out of tibet into dharamsala .
this is tenzin gyatso ; he was found to be the buddha of compassion at the age of two , out in a peasant 's house , way out in the middle of nowhere .
they could hear things , smell things , see things i couldn 't see .
in fact , on that other side is the area , tora bora , the area where osama bin laden 's supposed to be . this is the tribal area .
this is teaching photoshop in the tibetan children 's village in dharamsala .
thank you very much .
every 30 seconds , somewhere on this planet , a child dies of malaria , and paul levy this morning , he was talking about the metaphor of the 727 crashing into the united states .
and i will show you how we can use dogs in the fight against malaria .
my third story is perhaps even more remarkable , and , i should say , has never been shown to the public until today .
now think of what we can do with this .
or any date for that fact , it 's like , " i don 't exactly remember , but i can look it up for you . "
they 'll follow up with you , and we 'll take care of it . "
i was like , " i know . that 's what i 've been trying to tell you guys all along .
then i 'd make websites .
but if you can cross-reference this with the other data , then you 're basically replaying the roll of the fbi agent and putting it all together .
this is exactly where my old apartment in san francisco was .
so sometimes the databases get so specific .
well you have to take control over it .
so one of the things that i do is i actually look through my server logs very carefully .
it 's no different than sending a text .
it really should be called the recovery or return of asia .
but the stage is crowded .
it 's not just prevailing at war , though war still persists .
so we 've got , what , 17 more years to go or so before china 's bigger .
but you might ask , well so what in any case ?
and if we have policies in which we take it in that larger historical perspective , we 're going to be able to manage this process .
wars persist . power persists .
all the footage was taken from our open rov , which is a robot that we built in our garage .
so we decided to put the project on kickstarter , and when we did , we raised our funding goal in about two hours , and all of a sudden , had this money to make these kits .
i 'm a brain scientist , and as a brain scientist , i 'm actually interested in how the brain learns , and i 'm especially interested in a possibility of making our brains smarter , better and faster .
i 'd like to put this kind of friday night bar discussion aside and get you to actually step into the lab .
okay , we know how to measure attention in the lab .
but a few kids are sad and blue because they 've forgotten their coat .
we obviously don 't ask people to drive around and see how many car accidents they have . that would be a little costly proposition . but we design tasks on the computer where we can measure , to millisecond accuracy , how good they are at switching from one task to another .
there are some very poor uses of wine . there are some very poor uses of video games . but when consumed in reasonable doses , and at the right age , wine can be very good for health . there are actually specific molecules that have been identified in red wine as leading to greater life expectancy .
then , once they are done with the training , they come back a few days later and they are tested again on a similar type of mental rotation task . so this is work from a colleague in toronto . what they showed is that , initially , you know , subjects perform where they are expected to perform given their age . after two weeks of training on action video games , they actually perform better , and the improvement is still there five months after having done the training . that 's really , really important .
sw : yeah .
now , einstein also thinks , you know , working in caves and travelling through space -- it 's all very dangerous jobs .
e : la , la .
so let 's see if einstein will sing " happy birthday " to al gore .
sw : very good .
sw : you are very special . what would you like to say to all these nice people ?
because when you are a developing country in the world where you can see the problems that other countries are having , you can actually anticipate what that did and do things very differently .
the second thing in india has been the change in the role of entrepreneurs .
again , after having lived for more than 200 years under the east india company and under imperial rule , indians had a very natural reaction towards globalization believing it was a form of imperialism .
similarly , infrastructure -- for a long time , infrastructure was not a priority .
so there is a form of internal globalization which is happening , which is as important as external globalization .
it 's very difficult for a foreign university to come to india .
but if india grows at something like eight percent , income per year per person will go to 16 times by 2050 .
thank you very much .
i said , " i 'm designing newspapers . "
and design is responsible for this experience .
then we adjust the content accordingly .
although my family constantly struggled against poverty , i was always loved and cared for first , because i was the only son and the youngest of two in the family .
i started to realize , begging would not be the solution .
i decided to cross during the day , first because i was still a kid and scared of the dark , second because i knew i was already taking a risk , and since not many people tried to cross during the day , i thought i might be able to cross without being seen by anyone .
i didn 't even go to middle school .
but in america , i didn 't know what to do , because i had this overwhelming freedom .
nuna , it has been already 10 years that i haven 't seen you .
tm : thank you .
also around this time , at home , this was the computer that people were buying .
and if you 're wondering how much 16k is , this ebay logo here is 16k .
so there 's a lot more female gamers than people are really aware .
and what 's interesting about it is the market was actually created by the gamers themselves .
but i want you to try and think about what games could look like 10 years from now .
in the year of my birth the nintendo entertainment system also went into development .
unlike any pop culture phenomenon before it , video games actually allow us to become part of the machine .
i , however , have a problem very close to home .
there is a potential to do good as well .
the same with students or highly creative people , writers and people like that .
she 's never going to know a world where video games aren 't incredibly emotional and will probably make her cry .
to my grandmother , the washing machine was a miracle .
and they want the washing machine .
and these ones who have washing machines , but not a house full of other machines , they use two .
but the total energy consumption will increase to 22 units .
the machine will make the work .
but i 'll tell you some of that today .
and as i say , it could be a much larger number .
they range from 65 to 98 percent for these major groups of organisms , as shown in the dark blue bars .
so it allows us to sample these amazing habitats that are very far from the surface and very far from light .
geneticists have developed a similar tool called genetic barcoding .
and so they put this together , a list of all the species , where they 're known to occur , and it really seemed like a very esoteric , scientific type of exercise .
but to be fair , it lives in the deep waters of the mid-atlantic ridge , so it was a lot harder to find .
and we also found this spectacular yeti crab that lives near boiling hot hydrothermal vents at easter island .
now this bacterium is part of mats that are found off the coast of chile .
on the scale of decades , in our lifetimes , we 're going to see a lot of damage to coral reefs .
they were quite proud of the fact that you know , before the dust clears , if some soldier has been hurt they will have collected him or her , they will have brought him back , they will be getting world-class triage emergency care faster than you and i would be getting it if we were hurt in a car accident in a major city in the united states .
they 've been watching too much " terminator . "
i went back and i started putting a team together , the best guys i could find with a passion to do this .
this is a non-trivial thing to do , by the way .
and we started asking them all questions .
and that guy pushed himself back from the table ...
he 's got no arms .
" you need to come . "
those are political questions , economic questions , strategic questions .
and then it got bigger and bigger and bigger , and now it 's 886 pages long .
and i said , " who 's tony ? "
and brian the scientologist whispered to me , " they 're medicated , " which to the scientologists is like the worst evil in the world , but i 'm thinking it 's probably a good idea .
he said , " oh , from a biography of ted bundy that they had at the prison library . "
and they take that as a sign of madness .
i went on a psychopath spotting course , and i am now a certified -- and i have to say , extremely adept -- psychopath spotter .
and i emailed him and i said , " i believe you may have a very special brain anomaly that makes you special and interested in the predatory spirit and fearless .
and i said , " well , some psychologists might say that this makes you ... " and he said , " what ? "
and then i realized that becoming a psychopath spotter had turned me a little bit psychopathic .
so i went to his tribunal .
and what tony is , is he 's a semi-psychopath .
larry brilliant : should we feel good , or should we feel bad that 50 years of foreknowledge accomplished so little ?
in africa last year , africans ate 600 million wild animals , and consumed two billion kilograms of bush meat .
for others , withdrawal , nihilism , materialism .
but if you look at the globe , all around the earth , wherever there is low-lying area , populated areas near the water , you will find increase in sea level that will challenge our way of life .
we may see the eradication of guinea worm next year -- there are only 35,000 cases left in the world .
it is something to be greatly optimistic about .
in a cruel reversal , after we had almost conquered smallpox -- and this is what you must learn as a social entrepreneur , the realm of the final inch .
so , for example , when you touch a pencil , microbial exchange happens .
and i also like to think of offices as being a temperate grassland .
he went from thinking just about energy to also starting to think about human health .
it 's good for you because you can have a break after all these fantastic people .
and to understand what will be the effect of the toothbrush in the mouth , i must imagine : who owns this mouth ?
we was so , so stupid . the most stupid bacteria .
there is so many things to do ; it 's so fresh .
ptolemy , eratosthenes , einstein , things like that .
but if you take a lens , like that , this line is ack , ack , ack , ack , ack . like that .
that 's why i am here , to try to do it the best possible .
we give you white pages . invent .
it 's difficult , sometimes , to pick that one second .
i started a rule of first person perspective .
which tells you something about our place in the universe .
the gravitational pull of things was a lot stronger near the big bang .
that 's a wonderful insight , but it leaves something out .
we want to know -- this is 50 years ago , " surely , " you 're thinking , " we 've figured it out by now . "
but if there 's dark energy , and the dark energy does not go away , the universe is just going to keep expanding forever and ever and ever .
except if they locked the doors and kept us here literally forever , that would happen .
carl sagan once famously said that " in order to make an apple pie , you must first invent the universe . "
it 's cooling off .
so like i said , i don 't actually know the answer .
we 're going to talk -- my -- a new lecture , just for ted -- and i 'm going show you some illusions that we 've created for ted , and i 'm going to try to relate this to happiness . what i was thinking about with happiness is , what gives happiness -- or happiness , which i equate with joy in my particular area , and i think there 's something very fundamental . and i was thinking about this . and it 's in terms of both illusions and movies that we go see and jokes and magic shows is that there 's something about these things where our expectations are violated in some sort of pleasing way . you go see a movie . and it has an unexpected twist -- something that you didn 't expect -- and you find a joyful experience . you look at those sort of illusions in my book and it 's not as what you 'd expect . and there 's something joyful about it . and it 's the same thing with jokes and all these sorts of things . so , what i 'm going to try and do in my lecture is go a little bit further and see if i can violate your expectations in a pleasing way . i mean , sometimes expectations that are violated are not pleasant , but i 'm going to try to do it in a pleasant way , in a very primal way , so i can make the audience here happy .
and i really say , " no . " i mean , women can navigate through the world just as well as males can -- and why wouldn 't they ? however , this is the one illusion that women can consistently do better than males : in matching which head because they rely on fashion cues . they can match the hat .
wk : this is my home . this is where i live .
wk : i made four blades , just because i want to increase power .
wk : yeah .
so we learned the majority of anatomic classes taught , they do not have a cadaver dissection lab .
like this .
just like this , students can isolate anybody and dissect any way you want to .
17 who were madly in love and their love was accepted ; and 15 who were madly in love and they had just been dumped .
but anyway , not only does this person take on special meaning , you focus your attention on them .
it was : " what percentage of the day and night do you think about this person ? "
you know , if you ask somebody to go to bed with you , and they say , " no , thank you , " you certainly don 't kill yourself or slip into a clinical depression .
i 've looked at 130 societies through the demographic yearbooks of the united nations .
i 'll only just say a couple of things , and then go on to sex and love .
today 54 percent of people who are writers in america are women .
and i say , " who do you think these men are sleeping with ? "
so the divorce rate right now is stable in america , and it 's actually beginning to decline .
and i think , however , we can make good relationships with each other .
the things are connected in the brain .
but i want to tell you a story about -- to illustrate .
i would like to share with you this morning some stories about the ocean through my work as a still photographer for national geographic magazine .
but if they don 't get 12 days , they can fall into the ocean and die .
this is the daily auction at the tsukiji fish market that i photographed a couple years ago .
this ended up being the lead picture in the global fishery story in national geographic .
you 'll see that the photographer , of course , was not inside the cage here , so clearly the biologist is a little smarter than the photographer i guess .
but that 's due to natural predators like vultures that pick them off on a beach or predatory fish that are waiting offshore .
and this was an animal that was struck by a ship in nova scotia , canada being towed in , where they did a necropsy to confirm the cause of death , which was indeed a ship strike .
so when the fish control the urchin population , the ocean was restored to its natural equilibrium .
all of my work begins very simple .
but it 's also used to assign a temperature range .

and two months later on december 17th , orville wright powered the first airplane across a beach in north carolina .
at that speed , the surface of the airfoil is the temperature of molten steel -- 3,500 degrees fahrenheit -- like a blast furnace .
if a mach 20 glider takes 11 minutes and 20 seconds to get from new york to long beach , a hummingbird would take , well , days .
or perhaps , spider man will one day be gecko man .
electrical pulses form the thoughts in our brains .
it allows us to amplify our voices and our power as a group .
it 's hard to hold onto this feeling , really hard .
thank you . thank you .
no , not necessarily just a camera .
it would be inconceivable for us to do that work if we didn 't make people excited and uncomfortable with the things that we do at the same time .
i 'd collected -- i was a collector , major , big-time .
that was a desk took 40-some years to build .
that 's my daughter and me .
now let 's talk about the first one , cells in dishes .
we call it an organ-on-a-chip .
we can get incredible functionality inside these little chips .
and that can lead to diseases such as bronchitis .
is it metabolized in the liver ?
it 's really a convergence of disciplines , where biology is influencing the way we design , the way we engineer , the way we build .
i 'm going to have a pretty simple idea that i 'm just going to tell you over and over until i get you to believe it , and that is all of us are makers .
and it 's a fabulous event to just meet and talk to these people who make things and are there to just show them to you and talk about them and have a great conversation .
billy-bob , or billy bass , or something like that .
but at one time , it was fairly commonplace to think of yourself as a maker .
he liked to take things apart .
if you don 't know what those are , they 're just the " brains . "
they 're really creating new areas and exploring areas that you might only think -- the military is doing drones -- well , there is a whole community of people building autonomous airplanes , or vehicles -- something that you could program to fly on its own , without a stick or anything , to figure out what path it 's going .
the previous speaker has , i think , really painted a very good background as to the impulse behind my work and what drives me , and my sense of loss , and trying to find the answer to the big questions .
court : never .
boy : arguing with you is a waste of time , marcus .
marcus : the panthers .
you make people fuckin ' sleep .
i suppose that will take me to my last piece -- what cinema means for me .
witness : we walked and walked for two days .
you know what you are ? a crocodile .
ezra : my name is ezra gelehun .
cc : mr. gelehun , i 'd like to remind you , you 're not on trial here today .
n thank you .
and given that level of investment , it makes sense to use it .
so i think the eden project is a fairly good example of how ideas from biology can lead to radical increases in resource efficiency -- delivering the same function , but with a fraction of the resource input .
and just as natural systems tend to increase in diversity and resilience over time , there 's a real sense with this project that the number of possibilities just continue increasing .
and if you look at some of the organisms that have evolved to live in deserts , there are some amazing examples of adaptations to water scarcity .
so we were keen to scale this up and apply biomimicry ideas to maximize the benefits .
and it turns out that different things crystallize out at different stages .
far too much of the talk about the environment uses very negative language .
life was pretty good .
on a sunday night .
flash-forward to the next year and " the book of awesome " has now been number one on the bestseller list for 20 straight weeks .
i love the way that they see the world , because they 're seeing the world for the first time .
they were tough football players doing what they love , which was crushing skulls and separating shoulders on the football field .
i would imagine that you 'd have to be pretty aware of your surroundings and appreciating the small wonders that you 're starting to see in your new world .
can you believe they 've got a date from morocco ? "
we 've got books , buffets and radio waves , wedding brides and rollercoaster rides .
and i remember exactly where i was and what i was doing that day .
in fact , they 're a ton of fun .
the brain drain -- where all of the most educated and qualified leave and never come back .
and this is a spread from the local newspaper of the recent graduating class , and you can see the difference is pretty stark .
we now call this place home .
the first was a series of renovations of computer labs .
so in many cases this is not so much about making change as it is creating the conditions under which change is possible and the incentive to want to make change , which is easier said than done in rural communities and in inside-the-box education systems in rural communities .
so we took this kind of nebulous idea and have worked really closely with dr. zullinger for the past year on writing this as a one-year curriculum offered at the high school level to the junior class .
he 's interested in forestry , but he isn 't sure , so if he ends up not going to college , he will have developed some industry-relevant skills .
and you 'll now see the yolk and the white have separated .
each stage is magical because it creates the impression of something utterly new appearing almost out of nowhere in the universe .
within the first second , energy itself shatters into distinct forces including electromagnetism and gravity .
from about 200 million years after the big bang , stars begin to appear all through the universe , billions of them .
well , first , you need energy , but not too much .
you 'll be familiar with the double helix of dna .
and we human beings are part of that creative evolutionary pulse that began 65 million years ago with the landing of an asteroid .
then 10,000 years ago , exploiting a sudden change in global climate with the end of the last ice age , humans learned to farm .
so what big history can do is show us the nature of our complexity and fragility and the dangers that face us , but it can also show us our power with collective learning .
sometimes , in my project , i would take the painting and give it new meaning and new temptation about it .
this is a projection that can see the viewer as the viewer walks by .
and , of course , it 's one that 's dear to my heart , because all of these sentiments -- some banal , some a bit more profound -- all originally had come out of my diary .
and suddenly she sees a tank ambling down the main road of sarajevo knocking everything out of its path .
it was a very somber gathering of the reporters that worked there during the war , humanitarian aid workers , and of course the brave and courageous people of sarajevo themselves .
and an aid worker friend of mine told me the most beautiful story , or i find it beautiful .
i 'm not even a humanitarian aid doctor , and i can 't tell you the times of how helpless i 've felt to have people dying in front of me , and i couldn 't save them .
i see , i see one way in the back .
25 . now , the way we can square on most calculators -- let me demonstrate with this one -- is by taking the number , such as five , hitting " times " and then " equals , " and on most calculators that will give you the square .
let me try to take this one step further .
722 is 500 -- ooh , that 's a harder one .
thank you very much .
what i 'd like each of you to do is to call out for me any six of your seven digits , any six of them , in any order you 'd like .
by any chance , does anybody here happen to know the day of the week that they were born on ?
sixth -- was that a friday ? audience : yes .
audience : 17th . 17th -- i believe that was a sunday .
i know as a magician we 're not supposed to reveal our secrets , but i 'm not too afraid that people are going to start doing my show next week , so -- i think we 're ok .
i store them as words , and later on retrieve them as numbers .
if his cookie was even slightly bigger than my cookie , i had questions .
it doesn 't even occur to us that we should .
i woke up the next morning .
in fact , scientists have concluded that taken together , chronic loneliness poses as significant a risk for your longterm health and longevity as cigarette smoking .
and then you 'll be even more convinced you can 't succeed .
our minds and our feelings , they 're not the trustworthy friends we thought they were .
i 'm going to take a knife and see how much deeper i can make it . "
i couldn 't stop thinking about how much he was suffering , even though he never complained , not once .
i can , because that 's the world i want to live in , and that 's the world my brother wants to live in as well .
we don 't run around emitting ultrasonic squeaks , like bats .
we recognize them by the experiences , and we abstract them into symbols .
for everybody who does not know the public transport here in dublin , essentially we have this system of local buses that grew with the city . for every outskirt that was added , there was another bus route added running from the outskirt all the way to the city center , and as these local buses approach the city center , they all run side by side , and converge in pretty much one main street .
so here 's what we did .
the reactions i got were tremendous . it was really good to see .
but from the japanese perspective , it 's their duty to protect those who don 't know any better -- in this case , the ignorant gaijin -- from making the wrong choice .
now when the third group came in , they were told that their anagrams and their markers had been chosen by their mothers .
it requires that everyone treat choice as a private and self-defining act .
combine this with the assumption that more choices are always better , and you have a group of people for whom every little difference matters and so every choice matters .
choice no longer offers opportunities , but imposes constraints .
in a study i conducted with simona botti and kristina orfali , american and french parents were interviewed .
we live entirely by the imposition of a narrative line upon disparate images , by the idea with which we have learned to freeze the shifting phantasmagoria , which is our actual experience . "
if we learn to speak to one another , albeit through translation , then we can begin to see choice in all its strangeness , complexity and compelling beauty .
what 's different about them ? "
and then you have the emerging world cities , with a mixed variety of vehicles , mixed land-use patterns , also rather dispersed but often with a very dense urban core .
and these red dots show the most congested parts , which are the bridges that lead into the inner city .
and personally , i would like to do this every once a year or so , but they won 't let me do that .
each day , people make new decisions , and people change and the world changes around them , and each day all of these decisions are sort of nudged ever so slightly away from rush hour car driving in a way that people don 't even notice .
let 's talk a little bit about how nuclear fission works .
it 's made into a grade where it 's not usable for a nuclear weapon , but they love this stuff .
well , uranium dioxide 's a ceramic , and ceramic doesn 't like releasing what 's inside of it .
it 's a way to bring power to the developing world , because it 's produced in a factory and it 's cheap .
i graduated high school in may , and -- — i graduated high school in may , and i decided that i was going to start up a company to commercialize these technologies that i 've developed , these revolutionary detectors for scanning cargo containers and these systems to produce medical isotopes , but i want to do this , and i 've slowly been building up a team of some of the most incredible people i 've ever had the chance to work with , and i 'm really prepared to make this a reality .
these routes to happiness haven 't really increased happiness very much .
i also put in here the stress response .
and of course we know this intuitively , that happiness is not just the absence of misery .
we have basically at least two systems here , and they both are very ancient .
so you see , even 10-month-old babies , when they see their mother , will show this particular kind of smile .
the other thing is , that a piece of evidence is , is if you look at computerized text analysis of people who commit suicide , what you find there , and it 's quite interesting , is use of the first person singular -- " i , " " me , " " my , " not " we " and " us " -- and the letters are less hopeless than they are really alone .
the data isn 't terribly supportive of money buying happiness .
i end with a few quotes .
and a record executive walked up to me and invited me to nashville , tennessee to make a record .
it 's just incredible .
and i 've since then tried to keep technology at arm 's length in many ways , so it doesn 't master my life .
and the trick that richard dawkins does , which is to say , to look at them as simply as genes , as vehicles for genes .
those are the general approaches to life . that 's one way to look at life on earth today .
like those chloroplast cells -- they 're completely surrounded by other life .
that its operations and how it works is so similar that we can think of it as the seventh kingdom .
and the answer is : all of them .
and what technology is really about is better ways to evolve .
we have a moral obligation to invent technology so that every person on the globe has the potential to realize their true difference .
i 'm a designer and an educator .
i have been teaching for a long time , and in doing so have acquired a body of knowledge about kids and learning that i really wish more people would understand about the potential of students .
they produced flyers . they called offices .
there was no expense cost . perfect field trip .
to ask them to always have the right answer doesn 't allow them to learn .
and i said , " go read it . "
in this case , ours is about ideas and information , and , if we 're lucky , some entertainment . but the concept 's quite the same .
the first stage in a technology 's advance is that it 'll fall below a critical price .
among the dvd 's many assets is that it 's very small ; you can stick it in the mailer and post it cheaply .
this is a fascinating research from who that shows the effect of generic drugs on anti-retroviral drug compounds and cocktails .
and what 's interesting about the hybrids taking off is you 've now introduced electric motors to the automobile industry .
and you 've seen the numbers .
the occupy movement found a voice , and i still have to speak english constantly .
boom ! this is what happened .
it was amazing .
so back to the question , " can art change the world ? "
you have to go to the literature and look up what 's known about feet .
now how could it do that ? well , look more carefully .
this one disguises itself as floating algae .
now , you might have noticed something else about the animals when they were running over the rough terrain .
this is slowed down 20-fold , and the crab just zooms across that simulated debris .
the distributed foot , actually , is working more like a paddle .
this is the foot of an ant . you see the hairs and the claws and this thing here .
and when you watch how they detach it , it is bizarre .
it 's aerated , it can be peeled off easily , it doesn 't cause any irritation , it works underwater .
he 's built , in fact , a climbing foot-bot inspired by nature .
i was out of the air force in 1956 . no , no , that 's not true : i went in in 1956 , came out in 1959 , was working at the university of washington , and i came up with an idea , from reading a magazine article , for a new kind of a phonograph tone arm .
even when you 're standing in front of a megaphone , it 's pretty much every direction .
i 'm not at all against education .
i have been really lucky with this technology : all of a sudden as it is ready , the world is ready to accept it .
now , the question is , where 's the sound made ?
and so , another way of hopefully determining who 's friendly and who isn 't .
i actually drew that up on a little crummy mac computer in my attic at my house , and one of the many designs which they have now is still the same design i drew way back when .
has been with me ever since i was a child .
nelson mandela went to jail believing in violence , and 27 years later he and his colleagues had slowly and carefully honed the skills , the incredible skills , that they needed to turn one of the most vicious governments the world has known into a democracy .
but we have to practice .
but anger is like gasoline , and if you spray it around and somebody lights a match , you 've got an inferno .
so peace direct gets behind them to do that .
have you asked yourselves why and how so many dictatorships have collapsed over the last 30 years ?
welcome to " five dangerous things you should let your children do . "
the book is called " 50 dangerous things . "
i first saw this in a canadian film board film when i was 10 , and it left a lasting impression , to see babies playing with knives .
number five -- two-parter .
i just want to say , over the last few years i 've been -- had the opportunity to do this closing conference .
so you 're going to be able to go like this .
you know , it basically uses as its central premise greek mythology .
lightweight . portable .
day three , she gets a massively big pox on her shoulder .
no , i said what 's your favorite song ?
and then we decided that we 'd change it from english to dutch -- into " het globale verwarmen . "
so we build this building on stilts , then up here -- is where we 're going to put the new steinbeck auditorium .
now i wanted to use this talk to talk about global warming a little bit .
well , i was born in south africa and my parents were imprisoned for resisting the racist regime .
and so , i said -- i was annoyed -- i said , " what are you doing ?
but there 's one big puzzle remaining , and this was most succinctly put to me by my primary school math teacher in tanzania , who 's a wonderful scottish lady who i still stay in touch with .
but it 's really a tiny fraction of the size of an atomic nucleus .
we need to make the best mathematical models we can , the most consistent ones .
it 's still going on .
and i knew it would be amazing fun to bring brilliant students from these countries -- where they don 't have any opportunities -- together with the best lecturers in the world -- who i knew would come , because of the interest in africa -- and put them together and just let the sparks fly .
we emphasize problem-solving , working in groups , every student discovering and maximizing their own potential and not chasing grades .
so there 's 2005 , -6 , -7 , -8 .
and then entering university in northern nigeria .
in striving for the heights of creative genius , we want to give thousands of people the motivation , the encouragement and the courage to obtain the high-level skills they need to help africa .
local scientists must play leading roles and governments must be persuaded to buy in .
mike matas : and so throughout the whole book , al gore will walk you through and explain the photos .
and it works the exact same way .
picornaviruses -- these are things that include the common cold and polio , things like this .
if you 've got enough money to buy just a camry , you can build one of these too , and so we put a deep how-to guide on the web , totally free , with basically order-off-the-shelf parts .
you can see that this barcode is the same family , but it 's distinct from parainfluenza-3 , which gives you a very bad cold .
so how do we deal with this ?
they both have rhinoviruses ; we 've never seen this pattern in lab .
if , for example , you used a cell culture that 's chronically infected with papilloma , you get a little computer readout here , and our algorithm says it 's probably papilloma type 18 .
it 's not clear why they thought she had the flu , but they switched to tamiflu .
no one would even consider it , because no one had a clue that it could cause respiratory failure .
and the viral genome i 'm showing you right here ?
this is the guy who started the project in my lab , and this is the guy who 's been doing prostate stuff .
and the who has figures that suggest about 1.3 million deaths per year take place due to cross-contamination with needlestick injuries .
then we can take the nanopatch off and discard it .
you can see immediately that we have those projections in the skin .
but notice immediately the distinctly different curve that we achieve with the blue line .
so it 's a big problem , and it 's tied in with the needle and syringe because it 's a liquid form vaccine , and when it 's liquid it needs the refrigeration .
and as we look ahead i 'd like to share with you a thought : it 's the thought of a future where the 17 million deaths per year that we currently have due to infectious disease is a historical footnote .
the first embrace is something that we think , " oh , this is very easy , " but it 's actually getting harder , and that 's paying attention to the world around us .
as he often did , velázquez put himself in this painting too .
and it was such a blow that it woke me up , in the way that it was meant to be , i guess .
the first time i told these stories , a man in the audience raised his hand and said , " all these artists talk about their work , not their art , which has got me thinking about my work and where the creativity is there , and i 'm not an artist . " he 's right . we all wrestle with experience and challenge , limits and loss .
so , i began to do a research project of my own .
now , how on earth did we get to a situation like this , where we have 27 million people in slavery in the year 2010 ?
they climb into the back of the truck . they go off with the person who recruits them .
daphne , if i may draw your attention to one thing .
these young boys are in nepal .
now , if we do that , if we put the resources and the focus to it , what does it actually cost to get people out of slavery ?
they become consumers and producers and local economies begin to spiral up very rapidly .
and yet , if there 's one thing that every human being can agree on , i think it 's that slavery should end .
i came this close to changing species at that moment .
they didn 't know that what a seashell is , it 's templated by proteins , and then ions from the seawater crystallize in place to create a shell .
so it 's the conscious emulation of life 's genius .
life adds information to matter .
imagine being able to make ceramics at room temperature by simply dipping something into a liquid , lifting it out of the liquid , and having evaporation force the molecules in the liquid together , so that they jigsaw together in the same way as this crystallization works .
there are people who are mimicking the energy-harvesting device inside of purple bacterium , the people at asu . even more interesting , lately , in the last couple of weeks , people have seen that there 's an enzyme called hydrogenase that 's able to evolve hydrogen from proton and electrons , and is able to take hydrogen up -- basically what 's happening in a fuel cell , in the anode of a fuel cell and in a reversible fuel cell .
what if we were to separate out metals from waste streams , small amounts of metals in water ? that 's what microbes do ; they chelate metals out of water .
when they 're involved in foreplay , they 're thinking about something very , very important -- and that 's having their genetic material remain , 10,000 generations from now .
because we have to grow the capacity of this planet to create more and more opportunities for life .
a little bit further on in the article it said " a loss that would normally take the ice shelf 50-100 years to replace . "
one of the materials that can do this is a remarkable material , carbon , that has changed its form in this incredibly beautiful reaction where graphite is blasted by a vapor , and when the vaporized carbon condenses , it condenses back into a different form : chickenwire rolled up .
it 's a film that you can look through .
and for that i do not need an electric grid between us .
we should do better than this .
and the team is expert , and the team is courageous , and brimming with innovation and scientific discovery , as is true with any major expedition on the planet .
and now we 're there .
the water 's 85 degrees , and yet you 're losing weight and using calories , and as you come over toward the side of the boat , not allowed to touch it , not allowed to get out , but bonnie and her team hand me nutrition and asks me what i 'm doing , am i all right , i am seeing the taj mahal over here .
so many people come up to me now and say , " what 's next ? we love that !
sixty-four , that no one at any age , any gender , could ever do , has done it , and there 's no doubt in my mind that i am at the prime of my life today .
i bet you 're worried .
mainly because no one 's ever asked them before .
and that woman said something more amazing , and then the next woman said something more amazing , and before i knew it , every woman was telling me i had to talk to somebody about their vagina because they had an amazing story , and i was sucked down the vagina trail .
and i wanted to stop doing the " vagina monologues " because it felt too daunting . i felt like a war photographer who takes pictures of terrible events , but doesn 't intervene on their behalf .
but i have also recognized , in the course of seeing that violence , that being in the face of things and seeing actually what 's in front of us is the antidote to depression and to a feeling that one is worthless and has no value .
and she came , and she witnessed this , and she decided that she would go back and leave her husband , and that she would bring v-day to guatemala .
so we bought her a jeep . and in the year that she had the jeep , she saved 4,500 girls from being cut . so then we said to her , " agnes , well , what else could we do for you ? " and she said , " well , eve , you know , if you gave me some money , i could open a house and girls could run away and they could be saved . "
thank you very much .
and when he did , michael , the archangel , was sent to kick him out of heaven along with the other fallen angels .
and thirdly , i had access to all of the 1,000 pictures that these soldiers took .
he comes down and says , " i want to know , who is responsible ?
what do the people bring into the situation ?
in the later studies , they ran women .
when it gets up to here , there 's " xxx " -- the pornography of power .
we didn 't have money , so we had a cheap , little ad , but we wanted college students for a study of prison life .
they 're going to become numbers .
if they change their appearance , 12 of 13 -- that 's 90 percent -- kill , torture , mutilate .
so another report , an investigative report by general fay , says the system is guilty . and in this report , he says it was the environment that created abu ghraib , by leadership failures that contributed to the occurrence of such abuse , and the fact that it remained undiscovered by higher authorities for a long period of time .
that 's why we know their names .
to be a hero , you have to learn to be a deviant , because you 're always going against the conformity of the group .
take path one , you 're going to be a perpetrator of evil .
so the scene : the sky is filled with this fleet of helicopters carrying him in .
what 's the right thing to do ?
you 'd think with a bunch of smart people we wouldn 't be such suckers just for the pretty phones .
and from day to day , we have the techniques that we use .
i 'm just going back and forth ; i 'm not getting anywhere .
i mean , think about that . how grand . how ambitious .
but here 's the way it works .
it doesn 't matter what the calculations are .
but they can 't .
are you ready ? go .
dum ta da da dum dum ta da da dum well , your musician friend will stop you and say , " you know , the theme music for your data revolution , that 's an opera , that 's wagner .
if i could reveal anything that is hidden from us , at least in modern cultures , it would be to reveal something that we 've forgotten , that we used to know as well as we knew our own names .
and the organisms , i promise you , have all of their priorities in order .
but in fact they are doing them in a way that have allowed them to live gracefully on this planet for billions of years .
turns out that -- this is a galapagos shark .
co2 as a building block .
every red blood cell of your body right now has these hourglass-shaped pores called aquaporins .
loose nanoparticles . what is really interesting to me is that not many people have been asking , " how can we consult nature about how to make nanotechnology safe ? "
here 's a wind turbine manufacturer that went to a whale .
now in order to do this , the design challenge of our century , i think , we need a way to remind ourselves of those geniuses , and to somehow meet them again .
orgasm is a reflex of the autonomic nervous system .
and i said , " so , could you do it right here ? "
she said , " yes , if the sacral nerve is being oxygenated , you conceivably could . "
he told his doctor , who published a case report in a canadian medical journal under the title , " sexual intercourse as a potential treatment for intractable hiccups . "
anyway these women sat in front of an x-ray device .
so they came up with this plan , this five-point stimulation plan for the sows .
she said , " it was a big hurdle just to get farmers to touch underneath the vulva .
that is what they would do . pretty amazing .
and i must say , i think emeka is trying to send a lot of subliminal messages , because i 'm going to keep harping on some of the issues that have come up .
and like many african families , my parents could never save because they supported siblings , cousins , you know , their parents , and things were always dicey .
and , you know , you must be joking if you think you can get a slot .
he got sick again .
and i 'm not unique , right ?
four of them are white males -- non-native speakers .
with two paychecks , or three paychecks , i could solve a lot of my family 's problems .
and we as africans need to start challenging our leaders .
and sometimes just taking an interest in the individual , in the fellows you 've met , and the businesspeople you 've met , it can make a huge difference , especially in africa , because usually the individual in africa carries a lot of people behind them .
it was like , " where do you want to go ? "
just because you are born in rural arkansas , whatever , that doesn 't define who you are .
this adds together four different waves .
but i would say , " if i did that , too much would be lost . "
and i waited , and the next day i liked it a bit better , the next day i liked it a bit better , and now i really love it .
maybe the fact that he stayed up all night doing mathematics was the fact that he was such a bad shot that morning and got killed .
it is written in mathematical language , and the letters are triangles , circles and other geometric figures , without which means it is humanly impossible to comprehend a single word . "
this is my son tamer . you can see he 's really enjoying our mathematical trip to the alhambra .
and if you open your eyes again , you wouldn 't know that they 'd moved .
and this is the same idea . this is a symmetrical -- so everything has symmetry , where you just leave it where it is .
for example , what if i turn the starfish by a sixth of a turn , and then a third of a turn ?
now it matters what order you do the operations in .
what about the center of a triangle ? i can rotate by a third of a turn around the center of the triangle , and everything matches up .
so i think it 's a great example of things unseen , which the power of mathematical language allows you to create .
anybody with five or less digits , you 've got to sit down , because you 've underestimated .
so ghez , there we go . that 's your new symmetrical object .
this is margaret bourke-white 's -- one of her pictures she did .
and there 's something dangerous about glamour throughout most of history . when the witches cast a magic spell on you , it was not in your self-interest -- it was to get you to act against your interest .
this is alex ross 's comic book art , which appears to be extremely realistic , as part of his style is he gives you a kind of realism in his comic art .
god cannot be glamorous because god is omnipotent , omniscient -- too far above us .
the horizon , the open road , is very , very glamorous .
look next time you get these catalogs in your mail -- you can usually figure out where they hid the cord .
and in the life of an individual , we often associate that with some object .
this is another margaret bourke-white photo .
and here 's hedy lamarr .
but over the years , the blackboards were fine , but they ran out of chalk .
and they said , " ah , no problem ! we just get out and walk . "
so i did the next best thing .
and they 're similar . they have to kind of consciously open their nose .
so , what the hell .
one of the other things about the camel 's beautiful design is that its penis points backwards .
i 'm smartly designed .
of cargo , outrun a horse and cover 26 miles on a good day .
it changed the way our history developed .
we are the animals who eat cooked food .
now , cooking allowed also that we became a migrant species .
you know we have up to five tastes , three of them sustain us .
and actually you use it and it 's actually useful .
this control of muscle is very , very important , because , you know , there can be reflexes .
it actually takes the signal and changes it , and we continue , even [ though ] our eight signals would say , " stop , enough .
so our research -- and i think the research also at the universities -- are now fixing on these points to say : how can we actually -- and this might sound trivial now to you -- how can we change cooking ?
and that ends with a little clip of my father , of lou , talking about something that is very dear to him , which is the accidents of life .
and i came home and i said to my father and mother , " i just met this man : doesn 't have much work , and he 's sort of ugly , funny voice , and he 's a teacher at school .
nk : well actually i 'm here because i 'm the architect 's son , he was my father .
now his failure to satisfy the family life , is an inevitable association of great people .
i selected 2,000 years as my minimum age because i wanted to start at what we consider to be year zero and work backward from there .
i think that really puts human lifespans into a different perspective .
what looks like a forest is actually only one tree .
so as you can see , it 's in a churchyard ; it 's in scotland . it 's behind a protective wall .
so his thought was that flooding in the north of africa actually brought those coniferous trees down tens of thousands of years ago , and what resulted was this remarkable adaptation to this unique desert environment .
this is siberian actinobacteria , which is between 400,000 and 600,000 years old .
in the netherlands -- where i come from -- you actually never see a pig , which is really strange , because , on a population of 16 million people , we have 12 million pigs .
in low-fat butter , or actually in many low-fat products , when you take the fat out , you actually take the taste and the texture out .
there 's actually a company in greece that produces these cigarettes that actually contain hemoglobin from pigs in the filter .
so this is actually a dutch company , so i called them up , and i asked , " can i borrow a heart valve from you ? "
and actually , they 're very quickly becoming a reality .
seventy nations are developing remotely-piloted combat drones of their own , and as you 'll see , remotely-piloted combat drones are the precursors to autonomous robotic weapons .
it could create a landscape of rival warlords undermining rule of law and civil society .
anonymous lethal weapons could make lethal action an easy choice for all sorts of competing interests .

it was , for a long time , revered as the most reliable of cars , and then they had the big recall incident .
so , the lesson from physics is that entropy will always increase ; it 's a fundamental law .
arm amputation is usually caused by trauma , with things like industrial accidents , motor vehicle collisions or , very poignantly , war .
you 're missing not only these muscles , but your hand and your elbow too .
and these are very exciting research areas , but it 's really , really hard .
and jesse 's a good crane operator , and he did okay by our standards .
then we had one of those little surprises in science .
amanda kitts : sure . in 2006 , i had a car accident .
tk : okay , this was my goal .
ak : so i have the elbow that goes up and down .
tk : so we 're really excited , because now we 're getting to a clinically practical device .
she had a little sensor at the end of her prosthesis that then she rubbed over different surfaces , and she could feel different textures of sandpaper , different grits , ribbon cable , as it pushed on her reinnervated hand skin .
so those are just some of our goals .
i discovered the dark side of the industrialized food system .
now a while back , i wanted to be an nfl football player .
my little cousin told his dad that he would rather have the organic toasted o 's cereal because birke said he shouldn 't eat sparkly cereal .
we spent two and a half years conducting research ; we spent another year and a half in advance development .
so , we 're real , and we 've touched several hundreds of thousands of little girls .
girl 6 : like , if you were a girl and you were really adventurous and a real big tomboy , you would think that girls ' games were kinda sissy .
rockett : really ? what other party ?
but we 're really , really happy about who they are .
as a result , i knew i needed to make my own stories about this experience , new narratives to reclaim my identity .
and the other thing is , that because nobody 's seen or heard of an underwater wheelchair before , and creating this spectacle is about creating new ways of seeing , being and knowing , now you have this concept in your mind .
the days and weeks that followed , people fleeing to the hills , being forced to drink contaminated water or face death .
would you like to see that ?
you just scoop the water up .
and when it 's expired , using failsafe technology , the system will shut off , protecting the user .
all we 've go to do is make it sterile . how do we do that ?
to watch her better , the one-eyed monkey climbed onto the tree .
very confused at what we humans call justice .
no . it breaks through those .
and that 's because there is no clean water to drink , or in countries like india , people don 't know that they need to soap their hands before defecation .
what solution ?
while universities are trying to devise courses in conflict resolution , and governments are trying to stop skirmishes at borders , we are surrounded by violence , whether it 's road rage , or whether it 's domestic violence , whether it 's a teacher beating up a student and killing her because she hasn 't done her homework , it 's everywhere .
adrenaline , kill . it 'll give you the will .
it needs to be the yeast . "
" whoever defeats my daughter shall have half my kingdom and her hand in marriage ! "
because it seems to me that finding this uniqueness has to do with dealing with the whole force of globalization ; that the particular is central to finding the uniqueness of place and the uniqueness of a program in a building .
and out of this idea started spinning off many , many kinds of variations of different plans and possibilities , and then the plan itself evolved in relationship to the exhibits , and you see the intersection of the plan with the toroidal geometry .
well , they said , " people won 't understand , they 'll think it 's a discotheque . you can 't do that . "
and then i went away for four months and there was going to be groundbreaking .
i 'd like to conclude with a project i 've been working on for two months .
we call a natural object beautiful because we see that its form expresses fitness , the perfect fulfillment of function . "
i know it 's a cliche , but look , look how small , how tiny it has gotten .
you know , these last two cartoons -- i did them live during a conference in hanoi .
and technology has even changed our relationship to god .
now , talk of a divided place -- the country was cut in two .
i went to see a dozo chief ; he told me about his magical powers .
but they came up with a book , looking back at 13 years of political crisis in ivory coast .
and for dictators all over the world , the good news is when cartoonists , journalists and activists shut up .
we didn 't see a single shark .
this view of the world is a consequence of having studied degraded reefs .
these places bleached too , but they recovered faster .
this is very substantial .
we have this principal that we don 't touch ; that produces returns , social , economic and ecological .
and you already heard that less than one percent of the ocean 's protected .
it 's a top down hierarchical structure where people wait for government agents to come and this is not effective . and the government doesn 't have enough resources .
es : well , imagine that you have two gears of a watch , a big one and a small one .
we 've got 19 billion to spend on health care or something .
then one day , a man came to town with boxes and boxes of secret documents stolen from the parents ' rooms .
the end result was six ministers resigned , the first speaker of the house in 300 years was forced to resign , a new government was elected on a mandate of transparency , 120 mps stepped down at that election , and so far , four mps and two lords have done jail time for fraud .
and they 're all moving to this central system , this fully connected system , all of them except one . can you guess which one ?
but again , when it comes to the decisions which are impacting us the most , perhaps , the most important decisions that are being made about war and so forth , again we can 't just make a freedom of information request .
you 've got to have skepticism and humility .
in america , you have the cyber intelligence sharing and protection act .
they hardly ever make mistakes .
can we really scale this up ? can we really embed robotics into every part ?
so you could have something that climbs along and reads it and can output at one to one .
thank you .
that means one about every 15 minutes .
now , i started by telling you that there were some good-news stories .
we call this the human connectome , and you can think about the connectome sort of as the wiring diagram of the brain .
that is precisely what we do today when we decide that everybody with one of these brain disorders , brain circuit disorders , has a behavioral disorder .
we really do have it going right that the continent is growing at rates that people had thought would not happen .
this means that we have to focus on how our youth are going to be engaged in productive endeavor in their lives .
and it brings us to the debate that has been going on here : aid versus private sector , aid versus trade , etc .
how are we using it ?
my sister fell very ill with malaria .
and then my sister woke up .
do you all know that spain -- part of the eu -- got 10 billion dollars in aid from the rest of the eu ?
but i 'm not really sure that their assistance is also being channeled in the right way .
we 've not called the bill gates , and the soros , and everybody else who is helping and say , " sit down . let 's have a conference with you .
and then we can see that this is one combination of private , international , multilateral money , private sector and the african that we can put together as a partnership , so that aid can be a facilitator .
why can 't some of this aid be used as a kind of guarantee mechanisms , to enable people to take risk ?
and lastly , what are you going to do to be part of this partnership of aid , government , private sector and the african as an individual ?
well , it 's very interesting .
this is very rough , and this is sort of smooth , and this perfectly smooth .
anatomists were arguing very much about that .
now this simple rule is not an explanation of clouds .
when i first told it to my friends in mathematics they said , " don 't be silly . it 's just something [ silly ] . "
i measured it , 1.33 .
so the idea there was that one must be able to -- how do you say ? -- model price variation .
if you could find something new , anything , you will get your career made . "
first of all , because these shapes are so complicated that one couldn 't make any sense of the numbers .
in some cases , it 's recyclable .
we have an increasing population , and everybody likes their mobile phones , especially in this situation here .
you see , there are facilities now that can actually capture that methane and generate power , displacing the need for fossil fuel power , but we need to be smart about this .
i don 't want to make it so simplistic .
all of the embodied impacts in that lettuce get lost from the system , which makes it a far bigger environmental impact than the loss of the energy from the fridge .
would you ask me those questions ?
so this kettle here is an example of one where it actually has two reservoirs .
so imagine if , when you bought your mobile phone , your new one because you replaced your old one -- after 15 to 18 months is the average time that people replace their phones , by the way — so if we 're going to keep this kind of expedient mobile phone replacing , then we should be looking at closing the loop on these systems .
and he said , " well , recently i pitched a sustainability project to a client , and turned and he said to me , ' i know it 's going to cost less , i know it 's going to sell more , but we 're not pioneers , because pioneers have arrows in their backs . ' " i think we 've got a roomful of pioneers , and i hope there are far more pioneers out there , because we need to solve these problems .
actually , a lot of things are better with fire in my world , but the fire 's just a foundation .
so there 's a lot of sentences , so a lot of stars , and after rendering all of the audio , this is what we get .
even on the first view , your eyes will successfully pick out patterns , but on repeated views , your brain actually gets better at turning these patterns into information .
being from the massachusetts high-tech community myself , i 'd point out that we were hippies also in the 1960s , although we hung around harvard square .
and 10 years into the project , the skeptics were still going strong -- says , " you 're two-thirds through this project , and you 've managed to only sequence a very tiny percentage of the whole genome . "
and the first step took tens of thousands of years -- stone tools , fire , the wheel -- kept accelerating .
whole different paradigm -- transistors came out of the woodwork .
you add other forms of innovation and processor design , you get a doubling of price performance of computing every one year .
they tried that in animals , and these mice ate ravenously and remained slim and got the health benefits of being slim .
there are little machines doing things in experimental bases .
and with the new generation of scanning tools , for the first time we can actually see individual inter-neural fibers and see them processing and signaling in real time -- but then the question is , ok , we can get this data now , but can we understand it ?
but if we go to 2029 , we really have the full maturity of these trends , and you have to appreciate how many turns of the screw in terms of generations of technology , which are getting faster and faster , we 'll have at that point .
if you really look at the power of exponential growth , you 'll see that these things are pretty soon at hand .
and i became a school hero .
when i was 18 i started my own school .
i was hesitant to include this in my presentation because this cartoon was published soon after 9 / 11 .
forget it , they will confuse you even if you know how to draw .
you know , normally you work in isolation , and you show at a gallery , but here , the work was coming alive , and it had some other artists working with me .
and since then , i 've been painting all over the place .
she contacted anyone and everyone who was willing to buy my work .
i love my mother and i was told all of a sudden that she was going to die .
i was very upset .
you know i sat at home and i watched .
i walk into her room , and there was a shy girl , and she was bald , and she was trying to hide her baldness .
and we can use veterans to improve disaster response .
it 's to keep the men around him alive .
i think it 's very important , because right now somebody needs to step up , and this generation of veterans has the opportunity to do that if they are given the chance .
my head was cut open across the front , lifted back , exposing the skull underneath .
they 'd have to operate .
i was lying on a thin , hard spinal bed .
and i said , " what ? " and she said , " you 're going to get depressed . "
they told me , " we 're going to move you next to her because we think it will be good for her . "
i said , " mom , i 'm going to learn how to fly . "
he said , " would you like to have a go at taxiing ? "
and i spent every moment i could out at that flying school , way out of my comfort zone , all these young guys that wanted to be qantas pilots , you know , and little old hop-along me in first my plaster cast , and then my steel brace , my baggy overalls , my bag of medication and catheters and my limp , and they used to look at me and think , " oh , who is she kidding ? she 's never going to be able to do this . "
and then it no longer matters what you look like , where you come from , or what you do for a living .
because my students , what they said when they looked upon the world , and i asked them , " what do you really think about the world ? "
and in the ' 80s here , you have bangladesh still among the african countries there .
the problem in the world was the poverty in asia . and if i now let the world move forward , you will see that while population increase , there are hundreds of millions in asia getting out of poverty and some others getting into poverty , and this is the pattern we have today .
there is an uncertainty margin , but we can see the difference here : cambodia , singapore . the differences are much bigger than the weakness of the data . east europe : soviet economy for a long time , but they come out after 10 years very , very differently . and there is latin america .
the richest 20 percent of ugandans are there .
but this is what we would like to see , isn 't it ?
but this is hypothesis-generating .
and the first of these , the first two of these , is about a shift in power .
now notice , i 'm not talking about government .
now that begins with economic power , but that 's the way it always begins .
a fixed polarity of power means fixed alliances .
how many chinese troops are serving under the blue beret , serving under the blue flag , serving under the u.n. command in the world today ?
and what that means is the idea of a nation state acting alone , not connected with others , not working with others , is no longer a viable proposition .
suddenly and for the very first time , collective defense , the thing that has dominated us as the concept of securing our nations , is no longer enough .
but unlike the other speakers , i 'm not going to tell you about the mysteries of the universe , or the wonders of evolution , or the really clever , innovative ways people are attacking the major inequalities in our world .
and it 's something i 've never really found a good way of doing .
here 's one -- a head , followed by a tail , followed by a tail .
and i don 't want to end up in the two-minute silence to give you more time to think about it , until everyone 's expressed a view . ok .
on this side -- remember , you 're excited about head-tail-tail ; you 're excited about head-tail-head .
it 's a very , very simple example , an easily stated question in probability , which every -- you 're in good company -- everybody gets wrong .
the most pressing one is that we want to understand how some differences make some people susceptible to one disease -- type-2 diabetes , for example -- and other differences make people more susceptible to heart disease , or stroke , or autism and so on .
well , you 're right to be a bit skeptical , because that 's not the answer .
one explanation is that the person doesn 't have the disease -- that 's overwhelmingly likely , if you pick someone at random -- but the test gets it wrong , which is unlikely .
so he said , " here , i 'll assume that these events are independent .
there are two things involved -- two parts to the explanation .
well , we know that randomness and uncertainty and chance are very much a part of our everyday life .
forensic scientists said , " the chance that this guy 's innocent is one in three million . "
they 're the dominant builders and to a large extent , the dominant designers .
so , this is an astounding table .
because the problem is , when you have advanced cancer , we can 't do that much today about it , as the statistics allude to .
you know , in the mid-1850 's in france , they started to describe cancer by body part .
if we could even take it one step further and prevent disease , we can take it enormously the other direction , and obviously , that 's where we need to go , going forward .
people got upset , but this is the only way we 're going to go forward .
so , the states , are equivalent classes of history , and the cancer patient , the input , is the environment , the diet , the treatment , the genetic mutations .
it 's never been shown .
so , this picture , although it is beautiful , is a 40-gigabyte picture of the whole proteome .
ten percent of people in the trial had this dramatic response that was shown here , and the drug went to the fda , and the fda said , " without a placebo , how do i know patients actually benefited from the drug ? "
the way we 've approached it is the field of proteomics , again , this looking at the system .
and so , i implore everyone here : think differently . come up with new ideas .
how do we self-identify and how mutable is that identity ?
that means she takes the credit and then makes us come out here and do all the work .
you 're all so responsible for this world that we live in today .
the point is , i 'm happy somebody has practical ideas to get us out of this mess .
so then i 'm like , should i be nervous , you know , because maybe it 's better .
so , but i think whether you own your own company or you 're just starting out like me , like something like this is so vital for people to just continue expanding their minds and learning .
but [ german ] .
good evening .
and then at college , it 's like she never came home .
i am originally from jordan .
that 's all , shukran . thank you very much for the opportunity .
and it 's a very effective way of ending your hate mail : " love markham , aged 4 . " still works .
so by the time i 'm finished talking here , there 'll be 864 more hours of video on youtube than there were when i started , and two and a half million more photos on facebook and instagram than when i started .
it 's like the de facto real-time newswire , if you know how to use it , because there is so much on twitter .
markham nolan : okay , so now if you 're a news producer , this is something you 'd love to run with , because obviously , this is gold .
and what this video shows , when you watch the whole thing through , is bloody bodies being taken out of a pickup truck and thrown off a bridge .
the bridge looks like it 's crossing the river east to west .
embracing otherness .
and how many times would my self have to die before i realized that it was never alive in the first place ?
another world was opening up around this time : performance and dancing .
in other words , race has no basis in biological or scientific fact .
it happens when i dance , when i 'm acting .
and if you can do that , incredible things happen .
therefore every moment really is the most important moment that 's ever happened , including this moment right now .
and for many years afterwards , i would have a desperate desire to taste ginger beer .
my mother sent yams and rice , and our old clothes , to his family .
never mind that i knew nothing about places like namibia .
a few years ago , i visited mexico from the u.s.
now , obviously i said this in a fit of mild irritation .
the consequence of the single story is this : it robs people of dignity .
what if my roommate knew about nollywood , full of innovative people making films despite great technical odds , films so popular that they really are the best example of nigerians consuming what they produce ?
the other said , " how much did we hire him for ? "
so i 've got to get there and be in complete panic .
" you 're a great actor , and i like to give to my actors -- why don 't you show me what you want to do ? "
and he said , " son , it goes on forever . "
so that 's as wide as we look at stories .
just talk about plot and say how wonderful you 'll shoot the film , what the visuals will be . "
but i said , " but the storm won the armada .
are you with child ?
bess : as you wish , majesty .
what 's the process of telling a story ?
it says that the rich are always sitting on the shoulders and survive on the shoulders of the poor .
in a storyteller 's mind , it 's a contradiction of moralities .
it is the hot topic .
so the genome really tells you much more about predisposition .
now of course , in medical application , that is very useful because it 's the same kind of information that the doctor gets from your family medical history -- except probably , your genome knows much more about your medical history than you do .
and applied minds gets a lot of calls from people who want help with their problems , and i didn 't think this was a very likely one to call back , so i kept on giving him to the delay list .
and so this picture , which looks like a big smudge to you , is actually the thing that got me really thrilled about this and made me feel like we were on the right track .
but i think this is actually just the beginning of how we 're going to treat cancer .
and then we do a clinical trial for a drug for lung cancer and one for prostate cancer and one for breast cancer , and we treat these as if they 're separate diseases and that this way of dividing them had something to do with what actually went wrong .
so what we need is to have a causative model of what 's actually going on , and proteomics actually gives us the ability to build a model like that .
it 's going to require a lot of work , a lot of research .
but it didn 't -- it never occurred to me that it had to be invented and that it had been invented only 350 years ago .
he said -- he called what he 'd done as making -- they didn 't call it a vacuum pump at the time .
something was missing , you know . i mean , these are -- it 's kind of weird to think that someone had to do an experiment to show that , but that was what was going on at the time .
and so you can start making up some rules .
it was 300,000 , probably , years ago that most of us , the ancestors of most of us in this room came up out of africa and turned to the left .
at any rate , when i was a boy , i , like , for instance , i had this -- i got this little book from fort sill , oklahoma -- this is about the time that george dyson 's dad was starting to blow nuclear -- thinking about blowing up nuclear rockets and stuff .
and so i -- i did some experiments .
we should have been , because it made a lot of smoke and it made a lot of noise , and it was powerful , you know .
i mean , you can 't make up results , and then do another experiment based on that one .
that 's back when travel was easy .
so -- and arrhenius ' theory -- and all the global warmers think -- they would say , yeah , it should go up in the daytime , too , if it 's the greenhouse effect .
you know , if they said , you know what ?
we see the same people over and over again , but that 's because we 're not really exploring the full depth and breadth of the city .
how cool is that ?
which battle do you think is harder ?
it all hit me .
what happened next , of course ?
he claims it 's done based on a unesco study .
" manal al-sharif withdraws from the campaign . "
the first thing , i got out of jail , of course after i took a shower , i went online , i opened my twitter account and my facebook page , and i 've been always very respectful to those people who are opining to me .
but all i know , and all i 'm sure of , in the future when someone asks me my story , i will say , " i 'm proud to be amongst those women who lifted the ban , fought the ban , and celebrated everyone 's freedom . "
but as a fine-art photographer i somehow felt that it wouldn 't catch on out there , that there would be a problem with trying to make this as a fine-art career .
but we 've become totally disconnected from them .
these images of bangladesh came out of a radio program i was listening to .
and what was also one of the bigger projects around that was moving 13 full-size cities up out of the reservoir , and flattening all the buildings so they could make way for the ships .
this is the town hall for the city .
there 's two factories of this scale in the same town .
so that gives you an idea of the kinds of migrations and the speed with which -- this is just the taxis being built by volkswagen .
this is going to show you , real time , an assembler . it 's a circuit breaker .
and i started getting in further and further into the factories .
these are just recently shot -- i just came back about a month ago , so you 're the first ones to be seeing these , these new factory pictures i 've taken .
and as much as there are great things around the corner -- and it 's palpable in this room -- of all of the things that are just about to break that can solve so many problems , i 'm really hoping that those things will spread around the world and will start to have a positive effect .
and so in this case , because it 's about a lot of these images and what they represent , and the kinds of questions they bring up , that we thought letting the images play out and bring someone to say , " well , what 's worldchanging.com , with these images , have to do ? "
and they 're going to push that up , from the bottom -- up into , i believe , into the households . and parents will be reacting to it , and trying to help them with the projects .
we go from the trench warfare of the first world war to the maginot line of the second world war , and then we go into the cold war , the iron curtain , the berlin wall .
this is an attack on the global commons .
and let 's pull it together in afghanistan today .
eighty-five percent cannot read when they enter the security forces of afghanistan .
to give you one example of the impact this can have , this little boy , eight years old , walked with his mother two days to come to the eye clinic put on by the comfort .
we talked earlier about the arab spring , and the power of all this .
i would argue life is a rheostat .
now a fourth factor really becomes an obsession , which is , never betray the illusion .
and so when i moved to new york city after college and got completely sucker-punched in the face by depression , i did the only thing i could think of at the time .
the mere fact that somebody would even just sit down , pull out a piece of paper and think about someone the whole way through , with an intention that is so much harder to unearth when the browser is up and the iphone is pinging and we 've got six conversations rolling in at once , that is an art form that does not fall down to the goliath of " get faster , " no matter how many social networks we might join .
i feel that there 's a massive and bizarre idea going around that we have to bring more computers into schools .
change is happening , and the change that is happening is not one that is in software .
that was a month of my life .
in the background , my bicycle .
not just showing up every now and then .
and i 'm all set to do it . i 'm all set to do it , but then it turns out that to set up here , you have like 10 minutes to set up !
the slinky moves . we 're going through different nodes of the wave , coming out this way .
there 's a riot going on on campus , and the police are chasing me , right ?
i 'm thinking of lorenz contractions and einsteinian relativity .
and you would think , would you not , that with all our science , with all our advances in society , with better towns , better civilizations , better sanitation , wealth , that we would get better at controlling mosquitos , and hence reduce this disease .
but it 's not one virus , it 's four , and the same protection that gives you the antibodies and protects you from the same virus that you had before actually makes you much more susceptible to the other three .
the first way is that you use larvicides .
we don 't want to do anything that you can 't undo .
a single female will lay about up to 100 eggs at a time , up to about 500 in her lifetime .
we can produce them , in a space a bit more than this red carpet , i can produce about 20 million a week .
but whereas a g.m. crop is trying to protect the plant , for example , and give it an advantage , what we 're actually doing is taking the mosquito and giving it the biggest disadvantage it can possibly have , rendering it unable to reproduce effectively .
your brains are about 100 million times more complicated .
galvani 's approach of probing the nervous system with electrodes has remained state-of-the-art until today , despite a number of drawbacks .
this is because , although each cell in our bodies contains the same set of genes , different mixes of genes get turned on and off in different cells .
since we took these first steps , the field of optogenetics has exploded .
and the logic of our experiment was simple .
we know from our formal model that the brain structure at the receiving end of the critic 's commentary is the actor .
come to think of it , knowing when you 're wrong without a teacher , or your mother , telling you , is a very hard problem .
it depends what the answer is though .
now , you use the virgin brand a lot and it seems like you 're getting synergy from one thing to the other .
so , just help us with some of the numbers .
rb : i know , i have -- the lawyers say you mustn 't do things like that , but -- i mean , speaking of which , tell us about -- rb : " pammy " we launched , you know -- mistakenly thought we could take on coca-cola , and we launched a cola bottle called " the pammy " and it was shaped a bit like pamela anderson .
and then 24 months from now , people will be able to take a ride into space .
and so , just the initial lift off from sugarloaf to cross the atlantic , as we were pushing into the jet stream , this enormous balloon -- the top of the balloon ended up going at a couple of hundred miles an hour , the capsule that we were in at the bottom was going at maybe two miles an hour , and it just took off .
your companies have had incredible pr value out of these heroics .
but just to clarify , the 25 billion dollars is gross , right ? that 's gross ?
rb : no , i think if you 're bringing up kids , you just want to smother them with love and praise and enthusiasm .
and he went , " furthermore , i 'm a priest myself . "
how do your family feel about each time you step into something big and new ?
so , for instance , there 's a doctor in africa that 's found that if you give a mother antiretroviral drugs at 24 weeks , when she 's pregnant , that the baby will not have hiv when it 's born .
50s , 60s , the mode of operation shifts more to the quest for wisdom and a search for legacy .
that 's a thing . google it .
everything we blog , everything we tweet , and everything we click is a public act of making media .
i mean , really , same example : if you don 't like politicians calling each other names , stop clicking on the stories about what one guy in one party called the other guy in the other party .
but if we place these technologies before student inquiry , we can be robbing ourselves of our greatest tool as teachers : our students ' questions .
what we do is important . it deserves our care , but it also deserves our revision .
it 's a bit funny to be at a conference dedicated to things not seen , and present my proposal to build a 6,000-kilometer-long wall across the entire african continent .
dry areas cover more than one third of the earth 's land surfaces .
here i am -- i 'm the second person on the left -- with the elders in gidan-kara , a tiny village outside of sokoto .
inside of the dunes we find shade .
how do we construct something like this ?
sand-stopping devices , made from sand .
so i thought , you know what , it 's what i 'm here to talk to you today about , though , truth and lies , fiction and reality .
i think the pinnacle of this for me — i 'll never forget this — there was this little girl named riley . she was tiny , and she used to always take out her lunch every day and she would throw out her fruit .
we know these characters aren 't real , but we have real feelings about them , and we 're able to do that .
and the store , strangely , people came to them and bought things , and they ended up paying the rent for our tutoring center , which was behind it , but to me , more important was the fact that i think the quality of work you do , kids would come and get instruction in writing , and when you have to walk this weird , liminal , fictional space like this to go do your writing , it 's going to affect the kind of work that you make .
dead languages .
if i 'm going to break down the fourth wall , i want fiction to escape and come into the real world .
and when you call and leave him a message , you just , on the outgoing message , it 's just whale sounds and then a beep , which actually sounds a lot like a whale sound .
but nico 's the best reader i could hope for .
how did we get here ?
there 's another thing happening around the country , which is that companies are starting to get concerned about their water footprint .
but they have no incentive to do so .
we 've returned more than four billion gallons of water to degraded ecosystems .
for those of you from the bay area , it was the same as walking from here to san francisco , then turning around and walking back again .
it was as if the marathon record has remained unbroken since 1912 .
the lowest wind chill we experienced was in the -70s , and we had zero visibility , what 's called white-out , for much of our journey .
as a result , we 'd had several days of eating half rations .
but getting external assistance like that was never part of the plan , and it 's something my ego is still struggling with .
i 've got some very faint , probably covered in makeup now , frostbite scars .
the common theme -- what makes it origami -- is folding is how we create the form .
because what you can do is take your problem , and turn it into a problem that someone else has solved , and use their solutions .
and if you don 't want to fold 400 scales , you can back off and just do a few things , and add plates to the back of a turtle , or toes .
but that 's the place where the mathematical ideas can get us over the hump .
so , no matter how i make a flap , it needs some part of a circular region of paper .
and if you want a different deer , not a white-tailed deer , but you want a mule deer , or an elk , you change the packing , and you can do an elk .
so now people can say , " i want exactly this and this and this , " and you can go out and fold it .
the design called for geosynchronous orbit 25,000 miles up , 100-meter diameter lens .
and that works whether you 're going into space , or whether you 're just going into a body .
you know , i 'm struck by how one of the implicit themes of ted is compassion , these very moving demonstrations we 've just seen : hiv in africa , president clinton last night .
and the simple fact is , if we are focused on ourselves , if we 're preoccupied , as we so often are throughout the day , we don 't really fully notice the other .
at any rate , at one point my brother-in-law , leonard , decided to write a book about a serial killer .
or we don 't know if that fabric is a technological or manufacturing nutrient ; it can be reused or does it just end up at landfill ? in other words , we 're oblivious to the ecological and public health and social and economic justice consequences of the things we buy and use .
and because my urban trance had been somehow weakened , i found myself stopping to find out what was wrong .
so this weighs a little more than a tenth of a pound .
so it turns out , the inertia , which governs angular motion , scales as a fifth power of r.
so you might want to have multiple robots carry payloads .
it also tells the robot where these obstacles are .
but because they sense the neighbors and because they sense the object , they have implicit coordination across the group .
so once you know how to fly in formation , you can actually pick up objects cooperatively .
so the robot then figures out what the features are .
let 's watch .
impose limits on what credit card companies can charge in interest and on what they can charge in fees .
we need character .
a wise person knows when to bend the rules .
the judge on the case , judge lois forer thought that this made no sense .
and michael disappeared .
the very practice is demoralized , and the practitioners are demoralized .
more hopeful are people we call system-changers .
and what the veterans ' court did , was it treated each criminal as an individual , tried to get inside their problems , tried to fashion responses to their crimes that helped them to rehabilitate themselves , and didn 't forget about them once the judgment was made .
and the way they do it is to give third-year medical students patients who they follow for an entire year .
and so practical wisdom does not require heroic acts of self-sacrifice on the part of practitioners .
so einstein found that the medium that transmits gravity is space itself .
so kaluza says , maybe i can play the same game and describe electromagnetic force in terms of warps and curves .
so , imagine you 're looking at something like a cable supporting a traffic light .
so , let me just tell you how that goes .
the different frequencies produce the different particles .
but we believe the answer for why those numbers have the values they do may rely on the form of the extra dimensions .
so , if we knew exactly what the extra dimensions look like -- we don 't yet , but if we did -- we should be able to calculate the allowed notes , the allowed vibrational patterns .
and to me this is a really remarkable story , and a remarkable opportunity . going back to newton with absolute space -- didn 't provide anything but an arena , a stage in which the events of the universe take place .
so , i decided i would try this for a month .
the second reason i undertook this is because i 'm concerned about the rise of fundamentalism , religious fundamentalism , and people who say they take the bible literally , which is , according to some polls , as high as 45 or 50 percent of america .
i got rid of all my poly-cotton t-shirts .
but it 's a big part of the bible , so i figured i had to address it .
the first is , thou shalt not take the bible literally .
but i was saying thanks all the time , every day , and i started to change my perspective .
there 's a group i met with called the red letter christians , and they focus on the red words in the bible , which are the ones that jesus spoke .
and i failed miserably .
so they elevated it .
so we commissioned an economic feasibility study to try to make the case .
and the whitney is moving downtown and is building their new museum right at the base of the high line .
i refer to organized crime .
it may come as a surprise , but they played a critical role in the emergence of the market economy in eastern europe .
heroin , cocaine , women being trafficked into prostitution and precious minerals .
now , cigarettes out the factory gate are very cheap .
and a lot of licit banks were also happy to accept deposits from very dubious sources without questions being asked .
interestingly , the market share of heroin and cocaine is going down , because the pills are getting ever better at reproducing their highs .
the key to cybercrime is what we call social engineering .
they even affect the food that we eat and our governments .
we really have to ask the question : can the world sustain that number of automobiles ?
the beauty of hydrogen is it can come from so many different sources : it can come from fossil fuels , it can come from any way that you can create electricity , including renewables .
we actually think the future 's going to be event-driven .
you know , i could be wrong about this , but my sense is that in the public mind , today , that gm is not viewed as serious about some of these environmental ideas as some of your japanese competitors , maybe even as ford .
in my country , that was the case in 1974 .
we went to them and they said , " look , could you help us ? "
and before long , the condom was know as the girl 's best friend .
obviously , he 's had his vasectomy because his hotdog is half eaten , and he was very happy .
and he said , " mechai , could you come and join ? "
in every country , every program , you need a symbol , and this is probably the best thing he 's ever done with his mba .
and then finally , in thailand we 're buddhist , we don 't have a god , so instead , we say , " in rubber we trust . "
they plant the trees , and the money goes into their microcredit fund , which we call the village development bank .
we call this our school-based integrated rural development .
one way around this is to draw pictures .
and hemoglobin acts as a molecular sponge to soak up the oxygen in your lungs and then carry it to other parts of the body .
i 've left out error correction and a bunch of other things .
these sausage-shaped things are the chromosomes , and we 'll focus on them .
we 've been studying this thing they call the kinetochore for over a hundred years with intense study , and we 're still just beginning to discover what it 's all about .
the problem is we can 't show it to you any other way .
i think that without perhaps being able to name it , we are collectively experiencing that we 've come as far as we can with tolerance as our only guiding virtue .
i love it that my muslim conversation partners often speak of beauty as a core moral value .
" tender " is another word i would love to spend some time resurrecting .
and this trend of what rachel naomi remen is doing , how these kinds of virtues are finding a place in the vocabulary of medicine -- the work fred luskin is doing -- i think this is one of the most fascinating developments of the 21st century -- that science , in fact , is taking a virtue like compassion definitively out of the realm of idealism .
well , he was complicated .
forty-two million people were displaced by natural disasters in 2010 .
now we have instant neighborhoods outside .
other people started to believe in what we were doing , and actually offered us hangar space , donated hangar space to us . and then the georgetown airport authority was bent over backwards to help us with anything we needed .
till a couple months later , i went back to the same airport -- same plane , i think -- and looked up , and it said c.
and i would argue that it 's possibly more effective than the original billboard in terms of getting your attention , getting you to look over that way .
i like this for a couple of reasons .
i hate this stuff . it 's hard to read .
i don 't have the site . it 's just the piece itself .
and our goal was to try to humanize them a bit , and what i did was add type and people to the ad , which the previous campaign had not had , and nobody remembered them , and nobody referenced them .
this is rockstars talking about teachers they had lusted after in school .
it just seems to me possibly even a blank page would have been more appropriate .
if you allow that to happen , it 's really the only way you can do some unique work , and you 're going to enjoy the work a lot more as well .
and the best one i 've heard -- i 'm sure some of you have heard this -- the definition of a good job is : if you could afford to -- if money wasn 't an issue -- would you be doing that same work ?
they 've been celebrated in art and in poetry for centuries .
incredible .
they have plenty of males to choose from , and these females turn out to be very picky .
for the most part , these adult fireflies don 't get eaten because like their juveniles they can manufacture toxins that are repellent to birds and other insectivores , but somewhere along the line , one particular group of fireflies somehow lost the metabolic machinery needed to make their own protective toxins .
you might not notice when the first few flames flicker out , but in the end , you 're left sitting in darkness .
and he coughs a lot . very egotistical : he carries only one or two people and he asks always for more infrastructure .
and we are very close to my house .
and this is the model , how it 's going to work . so , it 's the same system ; the vehicle is different . and that 's the model .
this is the italian portal , the ukrainian park , the polish park , the japanese square , the german park .
please , allow me just two minutes .
and so i said , " you know what ?
it 's what gives purpose and meaning to our lives .
i 'm going in , i 'm going to figure this stuff out , i 'm going to spend a year , i 'm going to totally deconstruct shame , i 'm going to understand how vulnerability works , and i 'm going to outsmart it .
and the first words that came to my mind were whole-hearted .
i personally thought it was betrayal .
and this is a therapist who sees therapists , because we have to go to those , because their b.s. meters are good .
vulnerability pushed , i pushed back .
i 'm going to have a couple of beers and a banana nut muffin .
there 's no conversation .
i would say to companies , this is not our first rodeo , people .
at noon , you mark the changed position of the sunflower , and in the evening again , and that 's your clock .
along the y-axis , you have a scale from zero to 10 , and along the x-axis , you have , of course , the five senses .
now you can see , not even as intense an experience as riding a motorbike comes close .
so i brush my teeth twice a day , and what if we had a toothbrush that tastes like candy , and when the taste of candy ran out , you 'd know it 's time to change your toothbrush ?
so , i looked a little further , and what i figured out was that he wasn 't a nutcase .
and i want to give you an example of that .
i don 't know if we named the apple or if the apple named us , but ...
is agriculture adapted to that ?
now , the good news is that we have conserved .
the idea of svalbard was that it 's cold , so we get natural freezing temperatures .
it 's a backup system for all the seed banks . storage is free .
we need to collect the remaining diversity that 's out there .
so the logical evolution here is to just make a wheelchair with mountain bike components , which many people have done .
now , there 's three important points that i want to stress that i think really hit home in this project .
and this picture was taken in india in our last field trial , where we had a 90-percent adoption rate where people switched to using our leveraged freedom chair over their normal wheelchair , and this picture specifically is of ashok , and ashok had a spinal injury when he fell out of a tree , and he had been working at a tailor , but once he was injured he wasn 't able to transport himself from his house over a kilometer to his shop in his normal wheelchair .
well , we start our life with the racing car .
so the question is , why couldn 't we see it ?
the plot with the red and the green blobs , this is plotting different components of the data against each other .
now , how do we go about that sort of thing ?
but i 'm going to take some medication .
but these people , they tend to tell you that not only can they communicate with the dead -- " hi , there " -- but they can hear the dead as well , and they can relay this information back to the living .
hunting and fishing ? what is it ?
this is what they go through .
now , what does sylvia browne give you for that 700 dollars ?
she said that , first of all , that she didn 't know how to contact me .
it says right on the back here , " in case of overdose , contact your poison control center immediately , " and it gives an 800 number .
now , let me tell you , the james randi educational foundation is waving this very big carrot , but i must say , the fact that nobody has taken us up on this offer doesn 't mean that the powers don 't exist .
i 'm willing to take your suggestions , and i 'm willing to have you tune in to our webpage .
here 's one of our field sites , and just to give you a sense of perspective , this little blue smudge here , that 's one of my collaborators .
the frame and radii of this web is made up of one type of silk , while the capture spiral is a composite of two different silks : the filament and the sticky droplet .
this is the silk that 's used to make the frame and radii of an orb web , and also the safety trailing dragline .
so this makes quantifying silk properties by methods such as tensile testing , which is basically , you know , tugging on one end of the fiber , very amenable .
the 21 species are indicated here by this phylogeny , this evolutionary tree , that shows their genetic relationships , and i 've colored in yellow the orb-web-weaving spiders .
it 's like the spiders are sharing an ancient secret with me , and that 's why i 'm going to spend the rest of my life studying spider silk .
you 're going to meet milo for the first time .
now we 've used the hand .
it 's a company that microsoft acquired some years ago .
milo : ahhh . so close .
female voice : why don 't you try saying something encouraging to cheer milo up .
his mind is based in a cloud .
so you can imagine the scale of this problem .
and i think , if i can just borrow this camera , i was going to show you my invention , which i came up with .
what we 'd ideally want is images of the whole planet every day .
and not just one , but many .
it gives you a bit of a sense of scale of our two satellites .
the general point is that we will be able to track urban growth as it happens around the whole world in all cities , every day .
and what i would like to leave you with is the following question : if you had access to imagery of the whole planet every single day , what would you do with that data ?
and so with many privacy provisions put in place to protect everyone who was recorded in the data , we made elements of the data available to my trusted research team at mit so we could start teasing apart patterns in this massive data set , trying to understand the influence of social environments on language acquisition .
why were certain words born before others ?
that 's me and my son on the floor .
we call these wordscapes .
and the same idea now can be built up .
that drives tune-in behavior back into mass media , and you have these cycles that drive the overall behavior .
and i thought , " wow , this is powerful stuff . "
and then when i went through that big , horrible breakup with carl and i couldn 't get off the couch , i listened to your song , " now that i don 't have you , " over and over and over and over again .
it makes " what the bleep do we know " seem like a doctoral dissertation from harvard on quantum mechanics -- that 's how bad it is .
and i knew how mr. webster defined it : as the accumulation of material possessions or the attainment of a position of power or prestige , or something of that sort -- worthy accomplishments perhaps , but in my opinion not necessarily indicative of success .
and i tried to use that more or less in my teaching , whether it be in sports , or whether it be in the english classroom .
i had three rules , pretty much , that i stuck with practically all the time .
and another one i had was , not one word of profanity .
so you must have patience .
it 's you and i who make our fates -- we open up or close the gates on the road ahead or the road behind . "
there again , it 's getting the players to get that self-satisfaction , in knowing that they 'd made the effort to do the best of which they are capable .
and you know one of them was a starting player for a season and a half .
it 's such a beautiful place . it 's the most stunningly wild place i 've ever been .
for over a decade , the tahltan people , both clans , wolf and crow , have resisted this assault on their homeland .
but something weird happened .
they have a magazine that they call g2 .
and then i used it again to create six pieces for stefan 's book , " things in my life i 've learned so far . "
for some reason , i thought it would be a good idea to put an intermission in my talk .
there were four different versions of this .
i do spend a lot of time on my work .
and i actually really feel that it 's worthwhile to spend my valuable and limited time on this earth in this way .
i 'm going to play you now a sample of someone who has , two people actually , who have severe speech disorders .
and that happens in one individual .
now the power of the voice bank is that from this voice bank , we can now say any new utterance , like , " i love chocolate " -- everyone needs to be able to say that — fish through that database and find all the segments necessary to say that utterance .
now there 's millions of people around the world like samantha , millions , and we 've only begun to scratch the surface .
this is what william said : " never heard me before . "
that 's really not how it has to be .
by that i mean not being lost in thought , not being distracted , not being overwhelmed by difficult emotions , but instead learning how to be in the here and now , how to be mindful , how to be present .
of course in meditation — — we 're going to end up falling asleep .
we can 't change every little thing that happens to us in life , but we can change the way that we experience it .
you 're walking by the side of the road and you 're hit by a truck , or you 're trying to to jump on a moving train , you 're late for work , and your pant leg gets caught .
but the key is , you can have this great invention , you can have this great design , but how do you get it to the people who most need it ?
and we designed our knee to have the greatest range of motion of almost any other knee on the market .
we did a lot of iterations , not just around this , but some other things .
this is where we want to get , though , in the next three years .
this is our group , our main group of weavers .
and hope , of course , is the topic that i 'm supposed to be speaking about , which i 'd completely forgotten about until i arrived .
i wasn 't sure i heard it right , so i found him in one of the inter-sessions .
and here 's what he says , roughly translated : a man -- generic man -- a man , to be greatly good , must imagine clearly .
now , if we 're talking about medicine , and we 're talking about healing , i 'd like to quote someone who hasn 't been quoted .
i noticed that , despite all the efforts , there were familiar stories that kept resurfacing about individuals .
where are you traveling ? what are you reading ?
and it 's a leap , not a step .
and yet , just like salman , they were lifelong , tenacious self-learners , and our home was stacked with thousands of books , records and artwork .
the trick was to decompose the computer 's construction into numerous stand-alone modules , each of which could be individually specified , built and unit-tested in isolation from the rest of the project .
but given what i now feel capable of doing , i would certainly do it again .
well , if you try to tile it , it doesn 't work too well , does it .
thank you .
now , the fish in the tanks were gorgeous to look at , but they didn 't really interact with people .
so i literally came back from that job , quit school , hung my filmmaking shingle and just never told anyone that i didn 't know what i was doing .
and they had a lot of different techniques that they would use for foraging , but this particular one used vision .
and now you 've entered the realm of the mid-water community .
and it completely threw science on its head .
you think , " well , what happened ? "
i 've been to a lot of lectures where , at the end of it , inevitably , one of the first questions that comes up is , " but , but what can i do ?
and we can make changes to our behavior that will influence and affect the environment , like those people changed the health of that bay .
can you imagine going to your closet , pulling out a mothball , and chewing on it if you 're feeling depressed ?
well , they were happy as could be , because he hadn 't said a rational word in the weeks of observation .
this reason really is that i am a man who , almost 30 years ago , had his life saved by two long courses of electroshock therapy .
i know some people who got tenure in that place with lies like that .
you 've seen this painting by edvard munch , the scream . every moment was a scream .
and he went back to them , and they agreed to do another 10 .
my children came back to live with us .
but more importantly , i think , is the fact that a very significant proportion of people in this audience are under 30 , and there are many , of course , who are well over 30 .
science is clever , but great creativity is something less knowable , more magical . and now we need that magic .
ford undressed . she spread one leg , and then the other .
that 's the camp that we have in now 90,000 people , where 75 percent of them are women and children .
until they identify this case , we 'll never release him .
h my age -- because i was born in 1947 -- we were having , at that time , government , law and order .
so it was the need and the people we saw in the early ' 90s -- that 's what made us go back and work for them .
you see 300 patients , 20 surgeries and 90,000 people to manage .
she lived to a hundred , even then . all along it was the sadness , the squalor , but i never , until now loved her again .
her shadow once , fumbling the chain on her door , then the door slamming fearfully shut , only the barking and the music -- jazz -- filtering as it does , day and night into the hall .
" behold me , " the god of frenzied , inexhaustible love says , rising in bloody splendor , " behold me . "
" thirst . "
herself fall .
god knows though , there are worse twists your obsessions can take .
no . again , no .
we had to beat the european monarchy .
and i want to use an example of rio that we 're doing in madureira , in this region , to see what we should think as our first commandment .
it 's the brt , the bus rapid transit .
and this is the most controversial one .
rio has the aim , by 2020 , to have all its favelas completely urbanized .
this was something we did with ibm that 's a little bit more than a year old .
nothing of concern in terms of traffic .
but at the end of the day , when we talk about cities , we talk about a gathering of people .
that its transition from being something that we extract and derive from the world to something that actually starts to shape it -- the world around us and the world inside us .
and he said , " well , financial services . "
all they had was just a monitor in front of them that had the numbers on it and just a red button that said , " stop . "
they started with cinematch , and they 've tried a bunch of others -- there 's dinosaur planet ; there 's gravity .
and you can see it if you slow it down and attach lights to them , and they 're sort of like secret architects in your bedroom .
and they operate on milliseconds and microseconds .
but i can read this map , and what this map says is that , if you 're trying to make money on the markets where the red dots are , that 's where people are , where the cities are , you 're going to have to put the servers where the blue dots are to do that most effectively .
my primary responsibility was uganda , but also i worked in rwanda and burundi and zaire , now congo , tanzania , malawi , and several other countries .
what are you in america doing about it ?
and the maps of violence in most u.s. cities looked like this .
and so what we decided to do in the year 2000 is kind of put this together in a way by hiring in new categories of workers , the first being violence interruptors .
in other words , what do you mean , health problem ?
so i think this is good news , because it allows us an opportunity to come out of the middle ages , which is where i feel this field has been .
it wasn 't the only passion i had .
it 's a lady named leslie aiello .
the same is true every time as i started thinking about information .
so , music videos are something that i always found interesting , but they always seem to be so reactive .
i was going to work with small farmers .
so i said , " well , you 've got to make a rainforest ice cream .
we needed to be working on soy -- things that we were not focused on .
for bankers , we 'd be living off the principal , not the interest .
we 're not going to be able to do that .
is a bad feeder lot operation for beef better or worse than a bad grazing operation for beef ?
we need to focus on the where , the what and the who .
in fact , these names start coming up over and over again .
in salmon aquaculture , we kicked off a roundtable almost six years ago .
they 've funded research that shows that we can double global palm oil production without cutting a single tree in the next 20 years , and do it all in borneo alone by planting on land that 's already degraded .
the rest of the land can be used for something else .
whatever was sustainable on a planet of six billion is not going to be sustainable on a planet with nine .
so that was a sort of a success .
and i think the happiness , the important thing is this happiness does not come from only his own story and his joy of the music .
okay ? ready ?
and our joy of music , etc . , etc . ... "
what 's different ? did you see the eyes ? closed .
why are the eyes closed ?
it 's like being on a rollercoaster . yeah ?
and now there is a trumpet player who does something not exactly the way it should be done .
so that 's a good thing .
but not in a way that you want to stop .
this is olusosun dump , the largest garbage dump in lagos , and 2,000 people work here , and i found this out from this fellow , andrew saboru .
it 's worth 1.5 trillion dollars every year , and that 's a vast amount of money , right ?
and they went back to the drawing board , and they retooled , and they came up with another plan : we don 't sell you the phone , we don 't sell you the monthly plan .
the sneaker manufacturer told me that if they find that pumas are being pirated , or adidas are being pirated and their sneakers aren 't being pirated , they know they 've done something wrong .
they wished they knew how to prevent their food supply from sometimes failing , and how they could rest when they were tired without risking starvation , be warmer , cooler , safer , in less pain .
because that event was the scientific revolution , ever since which our knowledge of the physical world , and of how to adapt it to our wishes , has been growing relentlessly .
but , from the outset , it was obvious that there was something horribly wrong with it .
some rocks and some finches .
consider the ancient greek myth explaining seasons .
it 's equally testable .
so , in science , two false approaches blight progress .
hawaiians say it 's a good night for fishing .
his name is pius mau piailug .
the wisdom of these elders is not a mere collection of stories about old people in some remote spot .
you cannot make the voyage alone , you were never meant to .
it is a more hopeful , it is a more human , and is a more useful way of understanding our environment .
well folks , we have a protein problem .
forget nuclear holocaust ; it 's the fork that we have to worry about .
as a chef , i realize the easiest thing for me to do is reduce the portion sizes on my plate .
get a knife . cut it into four portions .
so what are we looking for in a meal ?
and i use that word , soulful , deliberately .
so , it was just before the time that the leonardo show was due to open when i finally made it back to the met , to new york , to see my new domain .
i mean , it 's a color that i can 't think of anything that you actually see in nature , that looks that shade .
but i took the job and i went on looking at these vases .
on the slightly uneven pink , on the beautiful gold .
so maybe it 's time we got this back a little .
i love his orange and pink breeches .
yeah . and as i drive through a neighborhood , say , where people got-a-lotta , i 'll take a mockingbird i caught in a neighborhood where folks ain 't got nada and just let it go , you know .
inside it , i will place a mockingbird for -- short explanation , hippie parents .
yeah . and then come the news crews , and the man-in-the-street interviews , and the letters to the editor .
and when i say desktop , i don 't just mean the actual desk where his mouse has worn away the surface of the desk .
maluma is on top . yeah . so .
and in this project we 've developed a form of intelligent real-time subtitles .
the idea is that it 's an image wholly constructed from its own history of being viewed by different people in an installation .
thank you .
" got something on my hair ? " here we go . alright .
the point being , no human being should be living anywhere near the dead zone .
and she said to me , when i asked her the obvious , " radiation doesn 't scare me . starvation does . "
now , like many of you , i have moved maybe 20 , 25 times in my life .
i was born in poland , now in the u.s.
so then i published the 3d designs , schematics , instructional videos and budgets on a wiki .
to me , the sky is always gray , flowers are always gray , and television is still in black and white .
and supermarkets , i find this is very shocking , it 's very , very attractive to walk along a supermarket .
prince charles has some similarities with nicole kidman .
but then , i just thought that this human vision wasn 't good enough .
we talk about ourselves .
i think they 'd make good allies .
but here 's the icing on the cake : it 's not just the first opportunity that you do with somebody else that 's probably your greatest , as an institution or an individual .
just remember , as dave liniger once said , " you can 't succeed coming to the potluck with only a fork . "
they have not enough water on most days and too much to handle when it rains .
and judy saw her landscape being destroyed and her water poisoned .
and she might not get to see that mountaintop .
we can create these local markets and incentives for recycled materials to be used as raw materials for manufacturing .
and imagine a national business model that creates local jobs and smart infrastructure to improve local economic stability .
and it 's about leading in a world that really does seem to be operating on the basis of fear .
but i really did struggle for financial support .
this is the large hadron collider .
yeah , it 's a wonderful achievement .
the electron -- the thing that goes around the atomic nucleus -- held around in orbit , by the way , by the electromagnetic force that 's carried by this thing , the photon .
fortunately , we have probably one of the greatest scientific achievements of the twentieth century that underpins that pattern .
but they 're necessary : they 're necessary to make that mathematics work .
they 're interacting with the higgs field .
and if i was to put money on it , i would put money on -- in a very unscientific way -- that that these things would also crop up at the lhc .
and on some of those planets , the oxygen , which had been created in that first generation of stars , could fuse with hydrogen to form water , liquid water on the surface .
unfortunately , not very long afterwards the company went out of business .
now , this was back in the 19th century .
and i 'd like to talk about some of those just for the next few minutes .
when i visited them a few years ago , what really impressed me was their willingness to prototype their ideas very early .
they went from retreating to the nurse 's station to discuss the various states and needs of patients , to developing a system that happened on the ward in front of patients , using a simple software tool .
now brunel may have asked a question like this , " how do i take a train from london to new york ? "
there is a hash tag there that you can use , # cbdq .
that means that you guys will soon be able to access one of these machines , if not this minute .
so in some cases , we can abolish totally the need for manual labor .
and very hard to even create this by hand .
they 're also now small enough to sit on a desktop .
this is something that is now possible today , that you can direct personally how you want your products to look .
what 's more likely , and we 're seeing it today , is that data gets sent to a local manufacturing center .
now this is not something that 's ready for the public , but it is in working progress .
br : that 's not it , though .
this is made from three ingredients : beets , barley , corn , and so it actually cooks up like hamburger meat , looks and tastes like hamburger meat , and not only that , but it 's basically removing the cow from the equation .
br : yeah , so you can imagine , a task like this -- this is another one of those assignments that the kitchen staff hated us for . but we really had to almost relearn how to cook in general , because these are ingredients , you know , plant life that we 're , one , unfamiliar with , and two , we have no reference for how to cook these things because people don 't eat them .
i 'm not the first person to say this .
if you use that , you can get away with anything .
but total movie revenues across theaters , home video and pay-per-view are up .
because what little hoodlum wouldn 't want a million and a half bucks-worth of stolen goods in his pocket .
but each bag we 'd sell would provide a year 's worth of school meals for one kid .
the numbers are pretty crazy .
i think it 's really interesting to look at agriculture from these two sides .
you know , i think if we really think that this is something that 's happened in the last 30 years , there 's hope in that .
well , if that bag of chips then becomes inherently more expensive than an apple , then maybe it 's time for a different sense of personal responsibility in food choice because the choices are actually choices instead of three-quarters of the products being made just from corn , soy and wheat .
in their final years , jim and shirley faced cancers , fractures , infections , neurological illness .
this is not a plan either ; this is illegal .
finally , last words .
well , don brownlee , my friend , and i finally got to the point where we got tired of turning on the tv and seeing the spaceships and seeing the aliens every night , and tried to write a counter-argument to it , and put out what does it really take for an earth to be habitable , for a planet to be an earth , to have a place where you could probably get not just life , but complexity , which requires a huge amount of evolution , and therefore constancy of conditions .
our planet is a good planet because it can keep water .
in that complex record of fossils , there were times when lots of stuff seemed to be dying out very quickly , and the father / mother geologists called these " mass extinctions . "
this is a buckminsterfullerene , a carbon-60 .
there was big stuff back then .
they hate we animals .
well , what 's the source of this ?
and i throw this slide in -- this is me , actually , two months ago -- and i throw this slide in because here is my favorite animal , chambered nautilus .
so , he now has taken mice down for as many as four hours , sometimes six hours , and these are brand-new data he sent me on the way over here .
how many of us flew here ?
without biologist alexander fleming 's moldy accident , caused by a neglected workstation , we wouldn 't be able to fight off so many bacterial infections .
anyhow , we were curious and hopeful and still wanted to give it a go .
mw : um ... uh , jeanny . jy : i 'm just joking .
but if our bacteria did not evolve to break down phthalates , they would have used some other kind of carbon source , and aerobic respiration would have led it to have end products such as carbon dioxide anyway .
there 's a sort of business model around being stupid in some sense .
they 'll play it over , and over , and over .
last month , i was at google , and , boy , that cafeteria , man .
and there was this person , muriel cooper .
and because of that , i always wondered about this human thing .
a very extreme culture .
i took these to tokyo in 2001 to make computer objects .
i wasn 't sure where to go with this . i invented cheeto paint .
and i wrote this book , " the laws of simplicity . "
basically , it always depends .
and then the kids graduate , and you have no responsibility any more -- that 's very good , too .
bringing them to life , bringing them to light .
he became a jesuit .
calming the audience down ; i 'm supposed to be whipping you into a frenzy , and i , " that 's enough . sh . "
because it 's true .
ladies and gentlemen , that was in 1984 in the united states , and i wish i had twitter .
that 's what hurts ! that 's what hurts !
and a male friend of mine pulled me aside and he said , " you want men to talk about violence against women and girls . men don 't talk . "
we 've come a long way since the days of the polaroid .
if you look really carefully in the upper right-hand corner , you 're going to see a thin white line , which is a road that was built in the 1970s .
that area 's about 30 million square kilometers , or about an africa 's worth of land , a huge amount of land , and it 's the best land , of course , is what you see . and what 's left is , like , the middle of the sahara desert , or siberia , or the middle of a rain forest .
those rivers are draining snowmelt from mountains far to the east , where snow melts , it travels down the river through the desert , and forms the great aral sea .
this is an environmental disaster writ large .
and it rivals climate change in importance .
you see a lot of this in africa , even latin america , but interestingly , eastern europe , where soviet union and eastern bloc countries used to be , is still a mess agriculturally .
at this rate , we 'll reach 9 billion people by 2040 .
or the colorado river , which no longer flows to the ocean .
how do we feed the world without destroying it ?
and so what we do is we compare the buildings within our perceptual bubble , and we make a decision .
so , it took the universe 11 billion years to build the brain .
it 's a symphony of your universe , your reality .
and once you have that , you can actually begin to build the neocortical column .
we can use different neurons with different variations .
so where do you go ? you go to ibm , and you get a supercomputer , because they know how to take 10,000 laptops and put it into the size of a refrigerator .
so , in summary , i think that the universe may have -- it 's possible -- evolved a brain to see itself , which may be a first step in becoming aware of itself .
and that also brought me to the fact that this poses such a risk to our society .
it would be ridiculous to claim that we know how we make consciousness in our brains , but we certainly can begin to approach the question , and we can begin to see the shape of a solution .
we have a me that is automatically present in our minds right now .
if i scan my retina through the horizontal plane that you see there in the little corner , what i get is the following .
and for a long time , people did not even want to touch it , because they 'd say , " how can you have this reference point , this stability , that is required to maintain the continuity of selves day after day ? "
so here 's how it looks . look at the region there .
and you have the cerebral cortex providing the great spectacle of our minds with the profusion of images that are , in fact , the contents of our minds and that we normally pay most attention to , as we should , because that 's really the film that is rolling in our minds .
and out of that came the instruments of culture -- religions , justice , trade , the arts , science , technology .
and how do you bring those two things together ?
and the point is when you lie in a hospital bed all day , all you do is look at the roof , and it 's a really shitty experience .
not particularly the world 's best design solution for those of us who are real , sort of , hard-core designers , but nonetheless , a fabulous empathic solution for people .
we were asked by a device producer -- we did the palm pilot and the treo .
why do we line up the square milk carton with the square fence ?
third section is this idea of not knowing , of consciously putting yourself backwards .
and then use that information to fuel solutions ?
there it is , pumping water from 30 feet .
but before we get there , we 're engaged in a struggle between good and evil , the good of socialism against the evil of capitalism , and the good shall triumph .
george w. bush : ... ending tyranny in our world ...
middle class is expanding in speed and scale unprecedented in human history .
but this claim is a rhetorical trap hidden behind a political bias .
they form separate yet integrated career paths for chinese officials .
china 's new president , xi jinping , is the son of a former leader , which is very unusual , first of his kind to make the top job .
those who expect the future to be better : a whopping 82 percent .
india , the largest democracy in the world , 94 and dropping .
it cannot be exported . but that is the point precisely .
not just from the central government , the city government , the provincial government , to the most local neighborhood districts .
they 'll be cooking , cleaning , buying things , shopping , building . but they aren 't here .
it has eight motors , four on the knees and four on the hip .
and we 've actually built a couple of these , and this is part of a larger robot made out of these cubes .
parallel universes .
yesterday , david deutsch , another one who covered most of what i was going to say .
the problem i have is because gordon brown , he comes onstage and he looks for all the world like a man who 's just taken the head off a bear suit .
when you think what 's happened to financial services , and you see what 's happened to the economy , you think , " well , there is a man who delivers on his promises . "
and the other one , of course , is donald rumsfeld , who said , " there are the known knowns , the things we know we know .
i think it would be something out of the aquatic ape thing , wouldn 't it ?
and there is george bush sitting there going , " heh heh heh heh ... "
sorry , what ? " a nu-ca-ler . "
he 's been honored with a statue now .
so a while after my dad was diagnosed , i was having coffee with my friend andrew lo .
does it cause heart attacks , kill people , liver failure , this kind of thing ?
you put them in a portfolio and you try to smooth out the returns .
we talked to hundreds of experts in drug financing and venture capital .
now there 's an obvious problem , which is , is there enough money in the world to fund this stuff ?
so i 'd like to think it was a good sign .
and also , it was kind of interesting that god needed help .
and i stopped expecting things to really change .
he also talked about , in particular , microlending , which is a tiny loan that could help someone start or grow a business .
maybe it was just that they could put sugar in their tea and offer that to me when i came as their guest and that made them feel proud .
we sent it over to uganda .
imagine if you 're speaking with somebody who 's growing things and making them flourish , somebody who 's using their talents to do something productive , somebody who 's built their own business from scratch , someone who is surrounded by abundance , not scarcity , who 's in fact creating abundance , somebody with full hands with something to offer , not empty hands asking for you to give them something .
i see entrepreneurs everywhere now , now that i 'm tuned into this .
so they can be a cash , or a cause , investor .
and that -- forget the tools , forget the moving around of resources -- that stuff 's easy .
i think you matter to god ; i think you matter to history ; i think you matter to this universe .
when the book became the best-selling book in the world for the last three years , i kind of had my little crisis .
and i began to think about what i call the " stewardship of affluence " and the " stewardship of influence . "
and so , you need to understand what your worldview is .
i know that 's a stereotype . i 've never met one of them .
if money actually made you happy , then the wealthiest people in the world would be the happiest .
it sounds like , he says , " god , i want you to make me famous . "
and i could go five years and never , ever see a homeless person .
and , by the way , my god doesn 't have to show up on cheese bread .
what do you do with a shepherd 's staff ?
what do you have that you 've been given ?
the bottom line is , god gets pleasure watching you be you . why ?
i 'm working with architect neil spiller at the bartlett school of architecture , and we 're collaborating with international scientists in order to generate these new materials from a bottom up approach .
that can 't be energetically sensible .
so , here is the technology we have today .
so , in summary , i 'm generating metabolic materials as a counterpoise to victorian technologies , and building architectures from a bottom-up approach .
in the middle east , conflict between israelis and palestinians continues unabated , and it becomes ever more difficult to see how , just how a possible , sustainable solution can be achieved .
they exclude people that died as a consequence of civil war , from hunger or disease , for example .
subsequent revisions of the agreement were facilitated by the british and irish governments , who never wavered in their determination to bring peace and stability to northern ireland .
the failure to achieve a negotiated solution for kosovo and the violence , tension and de facto partition that resulted from it have their reasons in many , many different factors .
conflict parties need to move away from maximum demands and towards a compromise that recognizes each other 's needs .
i think we have the opportunity to one-up the greeks .
that 's pretty neat .
and they actually come out kind of nice looking .
one is a print-on-demand machine that looks like a rube goldberg machine .
if you really care about books , you 're going to scan them better , especially if they 're valuable books .
yes , it 's a little boring , but some people kind of get into the zen of it .
but anyway , loaning out-of-print works from the boston public library , the woods hole oceanographic institute and a few other libraries that are starting to participate in this program , to try out this model of where does a library stop and where does the bookstore take over .
so we 've offered unlimited storage , unlimited bandwidth , forever , for free , to anybody that has something to share that belongs in a library .
it 's sort of the biggest tivo box you 've ever seen .
if you go and search on something -- this is google.com , the different versions of it that we have , this is what it looks like when it was an alpha release , and this is what it looked like at stanford .
thank you very much .
they are examples and schools of social life , because to sing and to play together means to intimately coexist toward perfection and excellence , following a strict discipline of organization and coordination in order to seek the harmonic interdependence of voices and instruments .
the music becomes a source for developing the dimensions of the human being , thus elevating the spirit and leading man to a full development of his personality .
he becomes a child in progress heading for a professional level , who 'll later become a full citizen .
it 's a notice of a zoning application change for a new office building so the neighborhood knows what 's happening .
so they tell you where it is , what the prices are , the address , the phone number , etc .
as long as we 're teaching our kids that heroism starts when someone scratches a mark on your forehead , or someone tells you that you 're part of a prophecy , they 're missing the most important characteristic of leadership , which is that it comes from within .
we can open up city hall .
now that is surgical thinking .
and so here you see him doing a lithotomy .
with the patient insensitive to pain , and a sterile operating field all bets were off , the sky was the limit .
this surgeon has over 3,000 hours of laparoscopic experience .
so , smartypants , why isn 't all surgery being done this way ? "
how would that change the capabilities of the surgeon ?
we need to be able to guide what we 're cutting in a much better way .
we can heal the disease .
but my story that i would like to share with you today is the one about success .
" and he will let go of the goat and run off . "
then in the same time , around 1980 , we had a very big drought .
" yes . our poachers . "
these were our own people .
the black rhino -- they were almost extinct in 1982 .
we knew conservation would fail if it doesn 't work to improve the lives of the local communities .
having goals is important , because if you want to change and steer the ship of a big city in a new direction , you need to know where you 're going and why .
so it was all about the data .
" what did you think about the lawn chairs ? "
i think one of the successes is in its emulation .
and the yellow line is the number of injuries , which has remained essentially flat .
and today , cyclists look like new york city looks .
we overestimate our longevity , our career prospects .
now i 'm a scientist , i do experiments .
but the question is , is it good for us ?
he found that the students were willing to pay the most not to get a kiss immediately , but to get a kiss in three days .
but individuals with severe depression , they have a pessimistic bias .
and then we asked them again , " how likely are you to suffer from cancer ? "
average likelihood is 30 percent , " the left inferior frontal gyrus would respond fiercely .
and at this point we stopped and we asked ourselves , would we want to shatter the optimism illusion into tiny little bits ?
i think this cartoon portrays it nicely .
i built -- i put a garage-door opener up in the attic that would pull this door up .
and so inevitably , you would transform yourself -- irreversibly , in all likelihood -- as you began this exploration .
you know , you know when you see it . you know when you can do anything in a space and you know when you can 't .
you can do tests that show that you 'll remember that i was talking about a chair a couple of days later a lot better .
thank you . john . that 's great .
but more generally , you know , one other example i think about this , which is great relative to the utopian idea .
true on the web -- also true in second life .
in fact , one of the ways to make money in second life is to make really cool translators that you drag onto your body and they basically , kind of , pop up on your screen and allow you to use google or babel fish or one of the other online text translators to on-the-fly translate spoken -- i 'm sorry -- typed text between individuals .
a lot of them -- about 55,000 people so far -- are cash-flow positive : they 're making money from what -- i mean , real-world money -- from what they 're doing in second life , so it 's a very build -- still a creative , building things , build-your-own-business type of an orientation . so , that 's it .
one is , it 's disturbing like the internet or electricity was .
she said , " that one 's the closest . "
he was 35 years old .
in one study , we showed people a simulated accident and we asked people , how fast were the cars going when they hit each other ?
and so i asked , were some of the things going on in this psychotherapy -- like the imagination exercises or dream interpretation , or in some cases hypnosis , or in some cases exposure to false information -- were these leading these patients to develop these very bizarre , unlikely memories ?
and i went through nearly five years of dealing with this messy , unpleasant litigation , but finally , finally , it was over and i could really get back to my work .
but i know from my work how much fiction is already in there .
two years ago , i was invited as an artist to participate in an exhibition commemorating 100 years of islamic art in europe .
no to burning books . the institute of egypt was burned on december 17th , a huge cultural loss .
so , when i die , my wife 's risk of death can double , for instance , in the first year .
it had become trendy to speak about the " obesity epidemic . "
well , what might be causing this clustering ?
and this was complicated because we needed to take into account the fact that the network structure , the architecture of the ties , was changing across time .
but we don 't just experience them , we show them .
and you might form the intuition that the unhappy people occupy a different structural location within the network .
so the friend of a friend of a 's is , back again , a friend of a 's , whereas the friend of a friend of b 's is not a friend of b 's , but is farther away in the network .
and finally , we even found that 30 percent of the variation in whether or not people are in the middle or on the edge of the network can also be attributed to their genes .
i think understanding social networks and how they form and operate can help us understand not just health and emotions but all kinds of other phenomena -- like crime , and warfare , and economic phenomena like bank runs and market crashes and the adoption of innovation and the spread of product adoption .
as humans , we are sensitive to where an object in our hand is heavy .
it 's fairly simple .
what 's behind that is a postulation , namely that not humans should get much more technical in the future ; rather than that , technology , a bit more human .
change.org is an online petition-sharing platform where you can create a petition and share it across all of these social media networks , through facebook , through twitter , through youtube , through reddit , through tumblr , through whatever you can think of .
haters gonna hate .
it 's been a roller coaster ride .
and through the children is usually the way to go .
but they do also a lot of other remarkable things .
well , basically , we dam it , we pollute it , we pour in pesticides , weedicides , fungicides .
but complacency does have a tendency to breed contempt .
and i hate to be so ironic and sarcastic about it but it 's the truth . it 's just one of the filthiest cesspools you can imagine .
we 're still working hard at it .
you know , most people are terrified of snakes .
whenever he eats the pit viper he gets this little venom rush .
one story that comes to mind in my undercover pieces is " spirit child . "
if i say you have stolen , i show you the evidence that you have stolen .
anas aremeyaw anas : this was another story on anticorruption .
the only way that you can let the person believe is when you show hard core evidence .
so i went through the very legal process , because at the end of the day , the prison authorities want to check whether indeed you have been there or not , and that 's how i got in there .
so i was thinking about my own life , and how i 'd like to memorialize my life , you know , for the ages , and also — — the lives of my friends , but the problem with this is that my friends aren 't quite keen on the idea of me taxidermy-ing them .
but , but this seems a bit unfair , right ?
but what i 'd like to talk about today is the fact that this morning , about a billion people on earth -- or one out of every seven -- woke up and didn 't even know how to fill this cup .
in 1987 , i was a new mother with my first child and was holding her and feeding her when an image very similar to this came on the television .
but today i 'm going to talk about access to food , because actually this year and last year and during the 2008 food crisis , there was enough food on earth for everyone to have 2,700 kilocalories .
this message , this word , can come out that this is not an old-fashioned way of doing business ; it 's a brilliant way of saving your child 's life .
and usually the institutions -- churches , temples , other things -- do not have the resources to provide a safety net .
food aid coming in every year when people are starving during the lean seasons .
it says " bon appetit " in arabic .
and they require that a third of that food come from the smallest farmers who would have no opportunity .
not only that , transforming hunger is an opportunity , but i think we have to change our mindsets .
your child will live a life ten years younger than you because of the landscape of food that we 've built around them .
obesity costs you americans 10 percent of your healthcare bills , 150 billion dollars a year .
she 's the third generation of americans that hasn 't grown up within a food environment where they 've been taught to cook at home or in school , or her mom , or her mom 's mom .
this is preventable disease . waste of life .
they want to be self -- they want to self-police themselves .
ok , school .
pizza for breakfast . they don 't even get given crockery .
jo : if the kids don 't know what stuff is , then they will never eat it .
in that is nearly as much sugar as one of your favorite cans of fizzy pop , and they are having two a day .
they owe us , to put a food ambassador in every major supermarket .
if you can cook , time doesn 't matter .
this can do 5,000 people a year , which is 10 percent of their population , and it 's people on people .

you bend down , you pat him -- you reward him for jumping up .
this is insanity .
" phoenix , come here , take this , and go to jamie , please . "
and i can imagine this dog , you know , speaking through the fence to , say , an akita , saying , " wow , my owners , they are so incredibly easy to train .
you think it 's something painful , or scary , or nasty .
how are you going to reprimand a grizzly bear ?
" johnny , don 't do that . "
no different from the dog barking .
all you 've got to do is to watch them , to time-sample the behavior , and say , every five minutes , you ask the question , " is it good , or is it bad ? "
i step on the brake .
and usually we do a fantastic job picking and choosing what we attend to on the road .
right ? i mean , somebody 's seen him .
one of the problems , when you get too much chatter , it 's hard to process all the packets , so you have to prioritize , and that 's where the predictive model helps you .
and i think it 's going to be a great thing .
bp : no need to be . there 's nothing wrong with old age .
it was beyond the technology of the day to depict a man aging backwards .
so there really was no tolerable margin of error .
and of course , the first step is : admit you 've got a problem .
i 'll give you an example here .
he believed that he could , in fact , catalog the human face .
and the " aha ! " was , what if we could take brad pitt , and we could put brad in this device , and use this contour process , and we could stipple on this phosphorescent makeup and put him under the black lights , and we could , in fact , scan him in real time performing ekman 's facs poses .
this is brad doing one of the ekman facs poses .
and you are seeing , now , that data being transposed on to ben 87 .
so we had one person focused on the eye system for almost two full years .
so it did take humans to kind of push it one way or another .
" you see that pier on the lake out there ?
and so if i were going to give you the ending of this story , it would go something like this : and that 's what ultimately led me to speaking to you here at ted about story .
in 2008 , i pushed all the theories that i had on story at the time to the limits of my understanding on this project .
it 's the invisible application that holds our attention to story .
but a major threshold is passed when you mature enough to acknowledge what drives you and to take the wheel and steer it .
you 've got to remember that in this time of year , 1993 , what was considered a successful animated picture was " the little mermaid , " " beauty and the beast , " " aladdin , " " lion king . "
mr. potato head : you going to make us , woody ?
i couldn 't get enough of it .
like this .
whatever i ended up being good at , i would strive to be worthy of the second chance i was given .
the german camp guards , they 've got bored .
so cochrane then goes to the germans who are running the prison camp .
i see it in the politicians we vote for -- people who , in the face of an incredibly complicated world , are nevertheless absolutely convinced that they understand the way that the world works .
cesar and i tried to write a piece for the new york times magazine explaining how this works .
and we don 't .
well you have this great big tank full of liquid detergent .
you try out 10 variations on that one .
now i 've been sort of banging on about this for the last couple of months , and people sometimes say to me , " well tim , it 's kind of obvious .
because it 's so hard to admit our own fallibility .
and there 's this huge hubbub .
you prove one , you prove the other .
they each smoked two packs a day , each , nonfiltered , and by the time i was six , i could order a southern comfort manhattan , dry with a twist , rocks on the side , the ice on the side so you could fit more liquor in the drink .
my book had a title page .
and to this day , i still can do karaoke to " ice , ice baby " without looking at the screen .
so my parents never found out about it .
and all the color just drained from his face , and he looked at me , and he said , " forget everything you learned . "
and i said , " yes , i have a job . i write and illustrate children 's books . "
mrs. alisch cut in front of the line and said , " i taught him how to read . "
the doorbell rang and it was a trick-or-treater dressed as my character . it was so cool .
i didn 't know it would happen so quick , at eight .
she 's like , " what ? " and she goes , " but mom , but men and women can 't ever see each other naked , mom .
would that ever happen ? "
that would never happen . "

and so for me , a mesh company , the " classic " mesh company , brings together these three things : our ability to connect to each other -- most of us are walking around with these mobile devices that are gps-enabled and web-enabled -- allows us to find each other and find things in time and space .
they made sure that the demographic for who they were targeting and the car was all matching .
so for this reason , i think one of the other themes with the mesh is essentially that , if we squeeze hard on things that we 've thrown away , there 's a lot of value in those things .
it 's contagious because we 're all connected to each other .
there 's this fabulous opportunity we have across the u.s. now : about 21 percent of vacant commercial and industrial space .

and that means that , maybe if we tweak it a little bit , we can increase the health and longevity of people .
although you 're looking for a drug that can solve aging in old men like me , what you could do now pretty well in the lab , if you were allowed ethically , is start a human life from scratch with altered genes that would make it live for a lot longer ?

part of the question that i have answered is , is we create by surrounding ourselves with stimuli : with human achievement , with history , with the things that drive us and make us human -- the passionate discovery , the bones of dinosaurs long gone , the maps of space that we 've experienced , and ultimately the hallways that stimulate our mind and our imagination .
and once we create new patterns in this brain , once we shape the brain in a new way , it never returns to its original shape .

no one has seen this before . this is literally stuff that we 've come through last week .
but video has been left out . it arrived on the web in a small box , and there it has remained , completely disconnected from the data and the content all around it .

how can one explain what one does at night in the lab , every single night ?
and then my father connected with nelson mandela 's anti-apartheid party .
he told me that he would have been unable to witness or submit to injustice without doing anything .
but there was no evidence .
how much of the light is being dimmed depends on how big the planet is .
in the next 15 years , almost 500 planets were discovered orbiting other stars , with different methods .
and we can find those that we would call habitable , meaning that they have similar conditions to the conditions that we experience here on earth and where a lot of complex chemistry can happen .
we don 't need to go to space to answer that question .
but there is something more profound here , something deeper .
let 's actually try that .
there is immense , powerful potential in life in this universe -- especially now that we know that places like the earth are common .

and we can then tubularize this scaffold .
we then tease the tissue apart into its two individual cell components , muscle , and these bladder specialized cells .
we exercise these prior to implantation .
and this is actually still , of course , experimental , not for use in patients .
so , we stack these wafers together , using the kidney cells .
and we prefer cells that will not reject and will not form tumors .
we started implanting some of these structures over 14 years ago .
so we did an experiment .
but nevertheless , neuroscience is turning up more and more in marketing .
so the first unproven claim is that you can use brain scans to read people 's thoughts and emotions .
now these studies are scientifically valid , and they 've been replicated , but they 're not the whole story .

and what it entails is the use of resin , of this very thick resin with a veneer of the same kind of wood that 's used throughout the hall , in a kind of seamless continuity that wraps the hall in light , like a belt of light : rather than separating , like a proscenium would separate the audience from performers , it connects audience with players .
so let 's see what it looks like .
now that foundation is so important that a number of us from the largest general surgery society in the united states , sages , started in the late 1990s a training program that would assure that every surgeon who practices minimally invasive surgery would have a strong foundation of knowledge and skills necessary to go on and do procedures .
even people who say they speak english , only 14 percent pass .
this past year i 've been in latin america , i 've been in china , talking about the fundamentals of laparoscopic surgery .
we get the words up in a window and then apply the magic .
now go ahead and cut .
what about the domestication of grains ?
the physicians of the ancient world -- especially the egyptians , who started medicine as we know it -- were very conscious of what they could and couldn 't treat .
and mark twain , who knew all about typesetting , really was smitten by this machine .
that was how quickly penicillin was produced and became one of the greatest medical advances of all time .
and nobody knows just why this was so , but one story can reflect something of it .
we need to learn , for example , from dr. cushing , who killed patients in the course of his early operations .
donnell leahy : thank you . i 'm kind of new to the ted experience and i 'm glad to be here , but i 'm just trying to put it all together , trying to figure all you people out , and i 've been here for a short while , and i 'm starting to understand a little bit better .
and i said , " i know you .
nm : i 'm not tuned . hold on .
nm : just tell them what — dl : she wants me to talk about — we have a band named leahy .
but of course what we have to remember is this .
the government , meanwhile , has been acting like santa claus .
i think i can safely say that i 'm the only trillionaire in this room .
sixty-eight is young today .
among other things , because startup companies are .02 percent of u.s. gdp investmentm and they 're about 17.8 percent of output .
graduate students wanted a way of telling which stage they were in .
it 's almost like leaving congress .
those stem cells self-organized , and that heart started to beat .
you 've also got flies , the size of flies , that are being made by robert wood at harvard .
and then they 'll be able to see color , and then they 'll be able to see in definition , and one day , they 'll see as well as you and i can .
i think what we 're going to see is we 're going to see a different species of hominid .
so , a quick strike like that . and if we slow it down a bit , this is the mantis shrimp -- the same species -- recorded at 1,000 frames a second , played back at 15 frames per second .
and low light is a critical issue with filming animals , because if it 's too high , you fry them .
and once the muscle 's contracted completely , everything 's stored up -- the latch flies upward , and you 've got the movement .
the saddle-shaped structure is also known as a " hyperbolic paraboloid surface , " or an " anticlastic surface . "
and we were able to get some force measurements out .
and what i 'd like you to do in this shot is keep your eye on this , on the surface of the load cell , as the limb comes flying through .
because obviously , if it 's breaking snails , the poor limb must be disintegrating . and indeed it does .
i told you three things last year .
large families still , and the hiv epidemic brought down the countries like this .
so this is what happens in the world , if we play the entire world .
and that means united states was richer , but lost more kids than india is doing today , proportionally .
and here we go . here we go .
i think it 's the best way of verifying historical statistics .
there is no one who has done it so far .
and how do they live ?
it 's about having food .
in 50 years they 've gone from a pre-medieval situation to a very decent 100-year-ago europe , with a functioning nation and state .
or if you are a teacher , you 'll love unesco , and so on .
and that 's good , it gets two plusses .
can i request a moment of absolute silence ?
what i 'm going to show you for a couple of minutes is a facility that i built in the toughest neighborhood in pittsburgh with the highest crime rate .
and so the first thing that you see in my center in the springtime is water that greets you -- water is life and water of human possibility -- and it sets an attitude and expectation about how you feel about people before you ever give them a speech .
and so in my building , which is full of sunlight and full of flowers , we believe in hope and human possibilities .
that 's puff pastry day . why ?
what we 've discovered is you have to give them flowers and sunlight and food and expectations and herbie 's music , and you can cure a spiritual cancer every time .
let me show you what these people do .
at the last show that we did , 200 parents showed up and we didn 't pick up one parent .
and that 's the room that 's initiating the relationship .
when the basie band came , the band got so excited about the school they voted to give me the rights to the music .
this was burned out during the riots -- this is next to my building -- and so i had another cardboard box built and i walked back out in the streets again .
the brown building is the one you guys have been looking at and i 'll tell you where i made my big mistake .
i said , " well , where would you build this thing ? "
and i went down into the neighborhood called bayview-hunters point , and i said , " the mayor sent me down here to work with you and i want to build a center with you , but i 'm not going to build you anything if you don 't want it .
i want you all to know that i think the world is a place that 's worth living .
what you 're drawn to are her eyes and the skin you love to touch .
if they do so at the appropriate time , the black box lights up and a panda bear pounds a drum .
and those distributions grow .
here 's what it looked like in the laboratory .
we 're the first in the world to record babies in an meg machine while they are learning .
it 's a worry -- isn 't it ? -- that the rest of the world 's media is doing such a bad job that a little group of activists is able to release more of that type of information than the rest of the world press combined .
and when kibaki got into power -- through a coalition of forces that were trying to clean up corruption in kenya -- they commissioned this report , spent about two million pounds on this and an associated report .
c 'mon , fire !
you have guys walking in a relaxed way down the street , and then an apache helicopter sitting up at one kilometer firing 30-millimeter cannon shells on everyone -- looking for any excuse to do so -- and killing people rescuing the wounded .
but are there risks with that , either to the individuals concerned or indeed to society at large , where leaking can actually have an unintended consequence ?
we don 't have sources who are dissidents on other sources .
so we were kind of skeptical that maybe it was a competing oil firm just sort of playing the issue up .
i mean , we 're an organization that is hard to grow very quickly because of the sort of material we deal with , so we have to restructure in order to have people who will deal with the highest national security stuff , and then lower security cases .
capable , generous men do not create victims ; they nurture victims ?
j i 'm not sure which way it 's going to go .
there seems to be a rule in nature that if you get too close to where you came from , it gets ugly .
go ahead and congratulate yourself give yourself a hand , the hand is your hand and the eye that eyes itself is your eye and the ear that hears itself is near ' cause it 's your ear , oh oh you 've done the impossible now took yourself apart you made yourself invulnerable no one can break your heart so you wear it out and you wring it out and you wear it out and you break it yourself breaking your own , break it yourself breaking your own , break it yourself breaking your own thanks .
as neuroscientists , we work in the lab with mice trying to understand how memory works .
so whenever a memory is being formed , any active cells for that memory will also have this switch installed .
xl : yep . you heard it right .
but what if we put the mouse in this new box but at the same time , we activate the fear memory using lasers just like we did before ?
and then we published our findings in the journal nature .
we can shoot light into the brain to reactivate the memory of the blue box .
how do we push this technology forward ?
and many of these technologies -- speaking as a physician and innovator -- we can really start to leverage to impact the future of our own health and of health care , and to address many of the major challenges that we have in health care today , ranging from the really exponential costs to the aging population , the way we really don 't use information very well today , the fragmentation of care and often the very difficult course of adoption of innovation .
let 's start with faster .
oh , we might have missed it , but using a.i. on top of radiology , we can find lesions that were missed before .
the ability to interact with your health care provider is different .
there 's even mirrors today that can pick up your pulse rate .
for those who have disabilities -- the paraplegic -- there 's the era of brain-computer interface , or bci , where chips have been put on the motor cortex of completely quadriplegic patients and they can control a curser or a wheelchair or , eventually , a robotic arm .
on the cardiac side , pacemakers are getting smaller and much easier to place so you don 't need to train an interventional cardiologist to place them .
we 're now approaching essentially a thousand-dollar genome -- probably next year to two years , probably a hundred-dollar genome .
this has been called by lee hood , the father of the field , p4 medicine .
so i 've studied a lot about stem cells -- embryonic stem cells are particularly powerful .
but often it 's too late and it 's stage iii or iv cancer , for example .
and so i set out with this concept , scientifically , that artistic creativity , it 's magical , but it 's not magic , meaning that it 's a product of the brain .
now the way that 's done is by the following .
and so the experiment really rests on the following : what happens in the brain during something that 's memorized and over-learned , and what happens in the brain during something that is spontaneously generated , or improvised , in a way that 's matched motorically and in terms of lower-level sensory motor features ?
as i like to say , these are not the " jazz areas " of the brain .
and then i 'm in the control room here , playing back and forth .
and let 's go ahead and play this video here .
whether or not you like the music is irrelevant .
but the pace of exponential growth is really what describes information technologies .
the logarithmic scale hides the scale of the increase , because this represents trillions-fold increase since the 1890 census .
i 've been making these forward-looking predictions for about 30 years .
but where will we get the software ?
it 's a new university that 's founded by peter diamandis , who is here in the audience , and myself .
and what 's happening is that there 's a globalization of illness occurring , that people are starting to eat like us , and live like us , and die like us . and in one generation , for example , asia 's gone from having one of the lowest rates of heart disease and obesity and diabetes to one of the highest . and in africa , cardiovascular disease equals the hiv and aids deaths in most countries .
that 's the honest truth .
the first thing i want to talk about is that when all of this money flowed into our country about 40 years ago , we embarked , the government of the day embarked on a series of government-to-government arrangements to have rapidly develop the country .
and it was called , those people are called the piarco airport accused .
we were trying to build , or reconstruct largely , an airport that had grown outdated .
what if it had happened before ? how would i find out ?
in africa , they 've had bailouts . in nigeria , six of the major commercial banks collapsed at the same time as ours , eh ?
so i plunged into this struggle , and i asked four questions .
and he was able to get the court , using that act of parliament , freedom of information act , to release the information , and i thought that was excellent .
we will continue to work within jcc .
one of my driving passions is this idea of exploring nature , and trying to find hidden data within nature .
and the list of scientific applications is growing every day .
and think about the immense sound of the universe forming .
forty-seven out of those 53 were unreplicable .
so this is a drug called reboxetine , and this is a drug that i myself have prescribed . it 's an antidepressant .
this is a cancer at the core of evidence-based medicine .
but people didn 't bother to use those registers .
when i was growing up , my heroes were people like fred astaire , gene kelly , michael jackson .
please be excited , have fun , yell , scream .
you know , you create power , then you tame it .
so they 're skin cells that can be tricked , kind of like cellular amnesia , into an embryonic state .
by combining tissue engineering techniques with microfluidics , the field is actually evolving towards just that , a model of the entire ecosystem of the body , complete with multiple organ systems to be able to test how a drug you might take for your blood pressure might affect your liver or an antidepressant might affect your heart .
i 'll see what i can do . ok ?
stonehenge is the remnant of a chiefdom , which is what you get with the invention of agriculture : multi-village polity with centralized rule .
first of all , it can accommodate ; it doesn 't deny the existence of inequality exploitation war .
and one reason is because of something i call the " growing lethality of hatred . "
in my defense , i 'd say , as naive as this may sound , it 's ultimately grounded in cynicism .
it 's especially hard to do when people hate you , ok , because you don 't really , in a sense , want to completely understand why people hate you .
what i want to talk to you about is what we can learn from studying the genomes of living people and extinct humans .
and we will find that the two genomes in me , or one genome of mine we want to use , will have about three million differences in the order of that .
and we can begin to say how much variance do we find , how many letters that vary in at least one of those individual sequences .
so there 's another interesting thing that comes from this realization that humans have a recent common origin in africa , and that is that when those humans emerged around 100,000 years ago or so , they were not alone on the planet .
the same is true if we look at a chinese individual versus an african , the neanderthal will match the chinese individual more often .
then modern humans emerged somewhere in africa , came out of africa , presumably in the middle east .
i 'm going to present a problem and try to give you an answer .
let 's talk about an enemy embedded within that battle space .
what we have trouble accessing is the transition space that must naturally follow , and creating the peace space that allows us to move on .
in a perfect world we 'd have 50,000 there .
we have one for processing economically bankrupt states .
we don 't have anything to translate that will into action .
what do you get then ?
you will get this model .
i ask you , who joins the military to do things other than war ?
it elevates mootw -- how we pronounce that acronym -- from crap to grand strategy , because that 's how you 're going to shrink that gap .
our long-term rationale becomes , we 're involved in a hair trigger stand off with the soviets .
i knew we 'd kick ass in the war with the leviathan force .
that sys admin force is the force that never comes home , does most of your work .
the force on the right , in and out .
i may not live long enough to get you there , but it 's going to happen .
you 'll see the pattern -- airborne , just like carriers .
so it 's better off to have them make some mistakes along the way than to see that .
i work in some of the most extreme cave environments on the planet .
i 'm very interested in mars , of course , and that was a product of my being a young undergraduate when the viking landers landed on mars .
it 's going to be everywhere we look -- where there are planetary systems that can possibly support it .
how do you know it when you find it ?
this is my favorite game on airplanes : where you 're in an airplane and you look out the window , you see the horizon .
and so , this stuff is like battery acid .
one of the interesting things about these particular guys is that they 're in the actinomycete and streptomycete groups of the bacteria , which is where we get most of our antibiotics .
i 'm not going to go through all of these projects now , but we 're involved in about half-a-dozen robotic development projects , in collaboration with a number of different groups .
one of the burning questions , of course , is if we go there and find life in the sub-surface , as i fully expect that we will , is that a second genesis of life ?
these losses , they feel , emotionally , they feel very different from what we actually thought about it when markets were going up . "
we 're not doing a great job managing money .
two thirds are not saving now .
well that 's at least what one wonderful study predicted .
what 's the difference ?
in too many 401 plans , if people do nothing , it means they 're not saving for retirement , if they don 't check the box .
if people have to check a lot of boxes to join a 401 plan , they 're going to keep procrastinating and not join .
we first implemented it , richard thaler and i , back in 1998 .
if you think about people and mortgages and buying houses and then not being able to pay for it , we need to think about that .
but in truth , what i really would like to explain to the public and to the audiences of moma is that the most interesting chairs are the ones that are actually made by a robot , like this beautiful chair by dirk vander kooij , where a robot deposits a toothpaste-like slur of recycled refrigerator parts , as if he were a big candy , and makes a chair out of it .
" exhibiting pac-man and tetris alongside picasso and van gogh " -- they 're two floors away . — " will mean game over for any real understanding of art . "
the international cat video film festival didn 't have that much of a reaction .
we live today , as you know very well , not in the digital , not in the physical , but in the kind of minestrone that our mind makes of the two .
and i was just recently at the eve online fan festival in reykjavík that was quite amazing .
so it was not very constructive .
and so is space , the spatial aspect of games .
and in a way , the video games , the fonts and everything else lead us to make people understand a wider meaning for design .
in a little over two years , we 've written up about 4,000 items -- replicable models , technological tools , emerging ideas -- all providing a path to a future that 's more sustainable , more equitable and more desirable .
as a small example , many of us have experienced the change in driving behavior that comes from having a real time display of mileage showing precisely how one 's driving habits affect the vehicle 's efficiency .
the political aspects of mobile phones can 't be ignored either , from text message swarms in korea helping to bring down a government , to the blairwatch project in the uk , keeping tabs on politicians who try to avoid the press .
earth witness would show us two worlds : the world we 're leaving behind , and the world we 're building for generations to come .
and that 's worth noting in particular .
look , i had second thoughts , really , about whether i could talk about this to such a vital and alive audience as you guys .
so what 's happening now is there 's been a big shift in the way that people die , and most of what they 're dying of now isn 't as amenable to what we can do as what it used to be like when i was doing this in the ' 80s and ' 90s .
so a group of us started doing survey work , and we looked at four and a half thousand nursing home residents in newcastle , in the newcastle area , and discovered that only one in a hundred of them had a plan about what to do when their hearts stopped beating .
it 's quite likely in an audience this size this won 't happen to anybody here .
she looks terrified .
one of them is , you can , just ask this simple question . this question never fails .
so i 'm an opponent of euthanasia , but i do think we have to give people back some control .
it 's a great tool for me to understand what could be our real needs .
so when you hear this sound you feel like a kind of shelter , preserved from noise pollution .
and turning around you is " shhhhhhh , " like that .
indeed in my studies i was a guinea pig for a pharmaceutical industry .
and your antibiotic goes smaller and clearer .
and john maeda was supposed to show several graphic animations in this exhibition .
and i tried to design a kind of canary .
and in this one , plants are used for the water filtration ability .
now we can be treated by smart medicine .
thank you very much .
five out of six of us live in the developing world .
i love being around these big wind generators .
here 's one the russians are already building that floats on a barge .
and if you look , wind and concentrated solar have the lowest co2 emissions , if you look at the graph .
in 2020 , the number will go down to 15,000 due to improvements .
over the ocean , it 's not even land .
there 's five to 10 times more wind available worldwide than we need for all the world .
pushing ahead with nuclear power will mean we really know where all of the fissile material is , and we can move toward zero weapons left , once we know all that .
thank you rod beckstrom . against .
so if we want to keep the lights on , we actually need a solution which is going to keep generating all of the time .
it was a sunny day and a windy night .
so if you were in palm springs ...
now , like most of us , i 'd been online , i 'd see my house , so i thought , i 'll hop in there and i 'll start looking up some of these facilities .
why do these things have to be so expensive ?
so now we had our constraint .
brain magic to me indicates that area of magic dealing with psychological and mind-reading effects .
how could somebody read using their fingertips ?
kt : i 'm so afraid of what i 'm going to see .
oh , my god !
that 's the question .
you don 't know what 's about to happen . is that agreed ?
kb : things that go bump in the night ?
nicole : three -- kb : like a tickling sensation ?
that 's it , all the way down , all the way down , all the way down , and further , and further , and further , and further , and further and further .
you can wait as long as you want , but only when you want the pressure released .
now , see , that 's because coke bottles are solid .
i want you to examine the shard of glass .
there 's five letters in the title .
now , steve -- oh , you can check underneath .
now , steve , you know where the spike is , but nobody else , does ? correct ?
ok , go ahead , mix them up .
kb : ok , tell me when to stop .
kb : thank you .
and so we 're starting to see a media landscape in which innovation is happening everywhere , and moving from one spot to another .
he traces the edges of the individual networks and then color codes them .
they were uploading it to qq , china 's largest internet service .
and so they started , the citizen journalists started reporting that as well . and there was an incredible picture .
they had to turn the spigot entirely off .
we saw some of the most imaginative use of social media during the obama campaign .
nobody in the obama campaign had ever tried to hide the group or make it harder to join , to deny its existence , to delete it , to take to off the site .
now the crazy thing is that media companies believe that if you fall within a certain demographic category then you are predictable in certain ways -- you have certain taste , that you like certain things .
they can make some educated guesses .
i think that media companies are going to hire a lot more women , because they realize this is important for their business , and i think that women are also going to continue to dominate the social media sphere .
she sang beautifully , and she even managed to say a few words in chinese : 送你葱 so it 's not like " hello " or " thank you , " that ordinary stuff .
around the same time , i was going through an audition -- the first ever open audition by national television in china -- with another thousand college girls .
how are they different , and what are the differences they are going to make to shape the future of china , or at large , the world ?
and because , as you know , the traditional media is still heavily controlled by the government , social media offers an opening to let the steam out a little bit .
they find themselves sort of sandwiched between the urban areas and the rural areas .
and it has aroused huge anger and frustration among our young generation .
it does not mean they will wear nothing in the wedding , but it shows that these young couples are ready to get married without a house , without a car , without a diamond ring and without a wedding banquet , to show their commitment to true love .
a health status of a nation parallels development of that nation .
what are the risk factors ?
if they have not worked , we have to look for alternative solutions .
and i will tell you how we 're able to do it .
this model can be adapted to every disease process .
but , you know , you have to tell people what can be done .
and for that money -- for every one patient that has the money to pay , it gives us an opportunity to take care of at least four people that do not have the resources to pay .
we will extend the same system into other areas , like dialysis treatment .
and i thought it might be helpful to basically cut off five of those retirement years and intersperse them in between those working years .
however the first thing that i needed was mosquito repellent typography because they were definitely around heavily .
i also started meditating for the first time in my life in bali .
so i 'm not sure if you saw your neighbor putting their hand up .
and i 'll show you a couple of projects that came out of the seven years following that sabbatical .
it has a more transparent identity .
after two weeks , three weeks , four weeks , five weeks .
they weren 't quite slick enough .
they jump high . they wear red .
my mother worked hard in the farm to grow crops so that we can eat .
i told my father , " i will only go through this ceremony if you let me go back to school . "
it 's practiced , it 's no anesthesia , it 's a rusty old knife , and it was difficult .
everybody who is my dad 's age , male in the community , is my father by default -- my uncles , all of them -- and they dictate what my future is .
i found wal-marts , vacuum cleaners , and lots of food in the cafeteria .
they said , " we wanted to put our girls in a safe place . "
now she 's the best student , not just in our school , but in the entire division that we are in .
we are making a difference , so if you change your world , you are going to change your community , you are going to change your country , and think about that . if you do that , and i do that , aren 't we going to create a better future for our children , for your children , for our grandchildren ?
as you can see , he 's heavily influenced by graffiti and street art , and his home city of mumbai is an ever-present element in his work .
he was first known for creating giant photo-realistic canvases , paintings of everyday objects , the stainless steel kitchen vessels and tiffin containers known to every indian .
social media were blocked at the firewall .
we live in a cambrian era of big data , of social networks , and we have this opportunity to redesign these institutions that are actually quite recent .
some of it 's very high-tech , and some of it is extremely low-tech , such as the project that mkss is running in rajasthan , india , where they take the spending data of the state and paint it on 100,000 village walls , and then invite the villagers to come and comment who is on the government payroll , who 's actually died , what are the bridges that have been built to nowhere , and to work together through civic engagement to save real money and participate and have access to that budget .
last year they saved a billion dollars , 30 billion rubles , from open innovation , and they 're pushing radically the extension of crowdsourcing , not only from banking , but into the public sector .
the second phase is in getting decision-making power out .
and it would be 30 years , but i would eventually get the answer to that question .
and the scene inside of this building was devastating and surreal .
and you may notice they 're wearing very thick gloves .
so penguins learn from previous experience , too .
and every year they rescue and raise abandoned chicks , and they have a very impressive 80 percent success rate .
that is , maybe you have a mind , and everyone else is just a really convincing robot .
and then finally , to show that some of the differences between people , in how we judge others , can be explained by differences in this brain system .
i really love cheese sandwiches . "
oh yeah , you were right . he took that one .
rs : should ivan get in trouble for taking joshua 's sandwich ?
and i 'm going to give that to you now .
and what i 'm going to show you is what happened when we look inside the brains of people while they 're making that judgment .
so their judgments of the case when everything was fine remain the same . they say she deserves no blame .
one is that you can 't be tmsed without knowing it .
rs : i hope they do . and i think they probably won 't .
it 's called oxytocin .
now luckily , oxytocin is produced both in the brain and in the blood , so i could do this experiment without learning neurosurgery .
the trick is you can 't see them , you can 't talk to them .
but wait . what 's wrong with this experiment ?
to investigate this question , we ran an experiment where we had people watch a video of a father and his four year-old son , and his son has terminal brain cancer .
i 'm working at a gas station on the outskirts of santa barbara , california .
again he asked me , " what do you think we should do ? "
you need enough nurturing for this system to develop properly .
and i took out a centrifuge and dry ice and needles and tubes .
so i ran this experiment recently for the korean broadcasting system .
there you go .
the reason we 're not sure absolutely is because of the nature of evidence preservation in our judicial system , but that 's another whole tedx talk for later .
it happens to us in all the aspects of our life , all the time .
their eyes just glaze over , all right ?
he was totally stoic . i couldn 't see a twitch of his eyebrow .
first of all , there 's a long history of antipathy between science and the law in american jurisprudence .
things have changed now . we have cars that we take across country .
you can see that here by the different reflection on this side .
so i want to leave you with one last impression about the project , or this kind of work and using smart materials .
and , of course , in real life , it 's all dynamic , meaning that it 's changing all the time , so the patterns of pulses are changing all the time because the world you 're looking at is changing all the time too .
here are three sets of firing patterns . the top one is from a normal animal , the middle one is from a blind animal that 's been treated with this encoder-transducer device , and the bottom one is from a blind animal treated with a standard prosthetic .
now i just want to wrap up , and as i was mentioning earlier of course i have a lot of other data if you 're interested , but i just wanted to give this sort of basic idea of being able to communicate with the brain in its language , and the potential power of being able to do that .
this is a photograph i found lying in a gutter in new york city about 10 years ago .
" i feel fine with the body i 'm in , there 'll be no easy excuse for why i still feel uncomfortable being close to my boyfriend , " from a twenty-two-year-old in japan .
" i feel skinny , but i 'm not . "
when i was awake , with the camera around my neck .
this is my studio in brooklyn . this is the arctic ocean , and the butchering of the second whale , seven days later .
and we could do something as arbitrary as , say , extract the story of rony , involving the concepts of blood and whales and tools , taking place on the arctic ocean , at ahkivgaq camp , with the heartbeat level of fast .
but you know , even holding one balloon is like , kind of happy .
this guy was breaking rocks with a hammer in the hot sunlight , but he just wanted to spend his life as a farmer .
he had this amazing knife that he pulled out of his gho and started brandishing when i asked him to make a funny face .
i asked her a little bit more about the cave and what she planned would happen once she went there , you know .
and up there , there are thousands of prayer flags that people have spread out over the years .
what this means is that , while regular acrylic only diffuses light around the edges , this one illuminates across the entire surface when i turn on the lights around it .
so if we are to live in a world made of smart materials , we should know and understand them .
so hannah 's artisanal work , and the fact that she shared her findings , opens the doors to a series of new possibilities that are both aesthetically appealing and innovative .
that 's what you should have said . right ? why is this ?
and yet , the irony is , the only way we can ever do anything new is to step into that space .
so we did it anyway . right ? of course .
what was really exciting about this project was we , and beau , had no idea whether it would work .
and the discussion is , who cares ? right ?
what was the feedback like ?
now ...
i was covering the war in afghanistan , and i witnessed , as a reporter for al jazeera , the amount of suffering and destruction that emerged out of a war like that .
for 10 years , unfortunately we have found ourselves reporting images of destruction , images of killing , of sectarian conflicts , images of violence , emerging from a magnificent piece of land , a region that one day was the source of civilizations and art and culture for thousands of years .
we in al jazeera were banned from tunisia for years , and the government did not allow any al jazeera reporter to be there .
this is the right moment , and this is the actual moment that we see all of these meanings meet together and then create the beginning of this magnificent era that will emerge from the region .
i remember one night when someone phoned me on my cellphone -- ordinary person who i don 't know -- from tahrir square .
i just have a couple of questions for you .
mohamed nanabhay who 's sitting with us , the head of aljazeera.net , he told me that a 2,500 percent increase of accessing our website from various parts of the world .
once a year , the only thing that went to the market was the cattle that we produced , and we made trips of about 45 days to reach the slaughterhouse , bringing thousands of head of cattle , and about 20 days traveling back to reach our farm again .
but during the time that i was photographing this , i lived through a very hard moment in my life , mostly in rwanda .
to build development , brazilian development , we destroyed a lot of our forest .
and i went . i started in the beginning of 2004 , and i finished at the end of 2011 .
that is the essence of our life , these forests .
in each point of those spots , we had planted a tree .
they have taught me a lot , and i 'd like to be able to share some of these observations with you .
what was different this time is the way that the terrorists used modern information communications technologies to locate additional victims and slaughter them .
" yes , yes , yes , " came the answers .
you see , you can now commit more crime as well .
every time a new technology is being introduced , criminals are there to exploit it .
that 's troubling , since the human body itself is now becoming an information technology .
the technologies got better , and now dna sequencing is proceeding at a pace five times that of moore 's law .
law enforcement is currently a closed system .
the threat is serious , and the time to prepare for it is now .
what does anyone mean when they talk about real security ?
you become your nation . you become your religion .
i was with women in pakistan who have had their faces melted off with acid .
there was a cabinet meeting and a meeting of the presidents to talk about whether " vaginas " could come to uganda .
in the years that she walked , she educated parents , mothers , fathers .
and then i suddenly realized that it absolutely didn 't matter where i was going , or where i had come from because we are all essentially permanently displaced people .
how does it impact your ability to work , or envision a future , or thrive , as opposed to just survive ? what i believe is if we could figure out how to make women safe and honor women , it would be parallel or equal to honoring life itself .
or worse , you let it run until it 's warm to rinse out your towel .
now , pvc is a little bit better , but still not as good as the wood that we chose .
and , remember , it 's sometimes the things that you are not expecting to be the biggest changes that are .
well , look , think of it this way .
one-two-three-four , one-two-three . yeah .
cc : triplet-triplet . triplet-triplet .
now for those who don 't believe this argument , we have trees and grass on our planet without the brain , but the clinching evidence is this animal here -- the humble sea squirt .
one reason is a very smart five year-old could tell you the algorithm for that top problem -- look at all possible moves to the end of the game and choose the one that makes you win .
so in my group , what we try to do is reverse engineer how humans control movement .
now what i want to convince you of is the brain also goes through a lot of effort to reduce the negative consequences of this sort of noise and variability .
and it has real beauty and real explanatory power .
and to do that , i 'll tell you about how the brain deals with sensory input .
everything left over is external to me .
so whatever is responsible for this cancellation is extremely tightly coupled with tempo causality .
and the game is very simple .
so think about just a point to point movement .
imagine i want to intercept this ball .
and finally , i want to remind you , when you see animals do what look like very simple tasks , the actual complexity of what is going on inside their brain is really quite dramatic .
well , a couple of friends and i figured out how to do this .
this invention will reduce global energy consumption by allowing remote control and automation of every outlet in every home and business .
in order to operate , this machine needs a number of things that this hospital has to offer .
so it seems crazy , but the model that we have right now is taking those machines that were designed for that first environment that i showed you and donating or selling them to hospitals in this environment .
there has to be something better . "
now that used to be a dangerous guessing game , because you only knew if you had given too little oxygen once something bad happened .
is it working ?
do you ever feel completely overwhelmed when you 're faced with a complex problem ?
it was front page of the new york times a couple months ago .
i 've been working on my new record and i 've never played these songs for anybody except the microphone .
it 's based on an argentinian rhythm called " carnivalito . "
and it seemed to me even he felt really bad facing these unorganized red squares day after day .
so i 'd like to -- i wanted to reintroduce some structure into that picture .
i would like to do a short test with you .
or here , for example , we have 27 pink squares with only one pink curve .
like books , clothes , toothbrush , etc . and it was great .
the pointillist movement is that kind of paintings where everything is broken down into dots and pixels .
and then maybe before i leave you ...
and it 's terribly endangered .
now if you 're using twitter or other social networks , and you didn 't realize this was a space with a lot of brazilians in it , you 're like most of us .
if you go back into the early days of the internet , when cyber-utopians like nick negroponte were writing big books like " being digital , " the prediction was that the internet was going to be an incredibly powerful force to smooth out cultural differences , to put us all on a common field of one fashion or another .
here 's what i think is going on .
it 's getting more connected .
in the u.k. , you can get up , you can pick up your computer when you get out of this session , you could read a newspaper from india or from australia , from canada , god forbid from the u.s.
the first thing you have to consider is that there are parts of the world that are dark spots in terms of attention .
and if you think this is absurd , it 's not .
to do this , at a certain point , you need someone to bump you out of your flock and into another flock .
and the truth is , this guy can probably explain this to you .
for some of us it might be music . for some of us it might be food .
that 's not good . hi . yeah . real bad . don 't even look at me .
because , you know , the one thing , one thing that you get with this disease , this one comes with a package , is you get a real sense of shame , because your friends go , " oh come on , show me the lump , show me the x-rays , " and of course you 've got nothing to show , so you 're , like , really disgusted with yourself because you 're thinking , " i 'm not being carpet-bombed . i don 't live in a township . "
i don 't know if you can get that here .
completely and utterly -- so , screwed .
i 've been trying inside i know that i 'm in trouble by myself but every time it gets me [ unclear ] and i 've been trying to be the one that you believe in and you 're the one that i want to be so saucy and you 're the one i want to [ unclear ] , baby and you can do anything as long as you don 't get hurt along the way back if i survive , i 'm gonna tell you what is wrong because if you were [ unclear ] and i think that you 're looking like a [ unclear ] i give you what i want to be and it 's like , you could use as many of those things that you want .
this is a fun one .
audience : the same.eddie obeng : the same .
how is that possible ? if you look at the visions we have , the visions of how we 're going to change the world , the key thing is implementation . we have the vision .
cyberspace moves everything at the speed of light .
okay ? so i 'll write the word " tap . " is that okay ? it 's a tap .
out here is the world . now , what 's happened to our pace of learning as the world has accelerated ? well , if you work for a corporation , you 'll discover it 's quite difficult to work on stuff which your boss doesn 't approve of , isn 't in the strategy , and anyway , you 've got to go through your monthly meetings .
so what i want to leave you , then , is with the explanation of why i actually traveled 60,000 miles from my desk .
both states feared the soviet union and strong arab states such as egypt and iraq .
in some ways , this sounds paradoxical , but according to martin indyk of the clinton administration , the iranians had not gotten it entirely wrong , because the more peace there would be between israel and palestine , the u.s. believed , the more iran would get isolated .
this is an analogy that is deliberately aimed at eliminating diplomacy , and when you eliminate diplomacy , you make war inevitable .
and i 'll get into why we 've so far been spared in a moment .
how do you get the vaccines moved around the world and the drugs moved , and whatever may or not be available that would work .
and 40 states already have an acute nursing shortage .
we know the virus will mutate . it will be a different virus .
and basically the economy would be in a disaster state of affairs .
so i personally think that our life expectancy for tamiflu as an effective drug is very limited -- very limited indeed .
it was likened to the plague .
do you want to view the pandemic threat the way back in the 1950s people viewed the civil defense issue , and build your own little bomb shelter for pandemic flu ?
it 's a very complicated ecology .
you could do it to your own kid . it changes color .
but it turns out that in 1918 that was not the case at all .
and in 1945 , he published an article in a magazine called atlantic monthly .
the system was designed to augment human intelligence , it was called .
byte magazine and communications at the acm had special issues covering hypertext .
and i saw it , and i thought , yep , that 's it .
i 'm not sure how well the chimpanzees read it , but they surely seemed interested in the book .
so i started getting interested in those issues and studying that in other animals .
now look at what happens at the very end of this .
so it 's actually fairly simple for them .
and so empathy has basically two channels .
so yawn contagion that you 're probably all familiar with -- and maybe you 're going to start yawning soon now -- is something that we share with other animals .
so they have a whole bucket full of them .
so the final experiment that i want to mention to you is our fairness study .
then she sees the other one getting grape , and you will see what happens .
and i think philosophers need to rethink their philosophy for awhile .
it 's 25 lectures full of all sorts of facts , it uses this giant book called " principles of neural science " by three famous neuroscientists .
so i did start teaching this course on ignorance , and it 's been quite interesting and i 'd like to tell you to go to the website .
so what do we do about this ? well , the fact is that what scientists do about it is a kind of a controlled neglect , if you will .
or make it manageable . but i don 't think that 's the case .
so how do we think about these questions ?
well , one thing the brain does , it moves us around .
i 'll give you an example from my own lab , my own particularly smelly question , since we work on the sense of smell .
i guess it comes down to our education system , so i 'm going to talk a little bit about ignorance and education , because i think that 's where it really has to play out .
so what do we do ? well the geneticists , i have to say , have an interesting maxim they live by .
when i took this picture , the window was frozen because of the moisture of the night .
well , in a balloon it 's easy , we have ballast .
i deeply believe that life is a much greater adventure if we manage to do politics without the trench between the left and the right wing .
what do you really want ? you want to go very fast in the wrong direction , or slowly in the good direction ?
it 's to show you how much gas was left in the last bottles .
if you tell to people , we want to be independent from fossil energy in our world , people will laugh at you , except here , where crazy people are invited to speak .
we have now 70 people in the team working on it .
i don 't think it will transport 200 people in the next years .
and each time we have some ice in the future , we have to know that life will be great , and the success will be brilliant if we dare to overcome our fear of the ice , to go through the obstacle , to go through the problem , in order to see what there is on the other side .
the big idea here is , i think , a new piece of a solution to a fairly big problem in transportation .
150 years ago , locomotives got efficient enough , steam power , that we turned the continent into a country .
we can make it complicated , but what 's the world fighting over right now ?
i took this down to ground zero , and knocked my way through crowds for an hour .
i 'm thinking , " wow , that was great -- -- please lady , don 't say another word . "
not much has changed .
depending on whose numbers you believe , it 's between 60 and 85,000 people per day .
in 2015 , the lhc will almost double the energy of the colliding protons , and these more powerful collisions will allow us to explore further the particle world , and we will certainly learn much more .
but don 't expect me to actually perform the trick in front of your eyes , because the probability for me to penetrate the wall is ridiculously small .
it has just the right value to keep the universe hanging in an unstable situation .
it would be something like what happens with sand dunes on a beach .
and it raises an existential question , which is , if i 'm having this experience of complete connection and full consciousness , why am i not visible in the photograph , and where is this time and place ?
we all began in the awash valley in ethiopia .
there is no more drastic and sudden gap created between potential and actual mind than a severe head injury .
it 's the what our minds do every night to digest the day and to prepare to bridge from the potential mind when we 're asleep to the actual mind when we awaken the following morning .
and that was when i started to write a book , because i didn 't think it was miraculous .
this is a very , very low level in order to be kicked out of the health care system .
and when i underwent it and found solutions , this is the interrelationship between the tmj and the teeth .
this is an mri mra mrv , a volumetric mri .
an fm device in the cortex of the brain , the motor cortex , will send signals in real time to the motor points in the relevant muscles so that the person will be able to move their arm , let 's say , in real time , if they 've lost control of their arm .
i don 't know what i had in my mind .
this thing blinks all the time ; i 'll leave it out , so you might be able to see it .
lp : so when you get a chance , spend some time with simon .
and actually , with arduino , we have kids like sylvia that you see here , that actually make projects with arduino .
this one is made by a company called adafruit , which is run by this woman called limor fried , also known as ladyada , who is one of the heroes of the open-source hardware movement and the maker movement .
there 's some arduino balls collecting data and sort of measuring some parameters .
it 's interesting how , in 2009 , gizmodo basically defined , said that this project actually gives a meaning to twitter , so it was — a lot changed in between .
so we want other designers to pick this up and learn how to make great devices , to learn how to make interactive products by starting from something real .
thank you so much .
and nobody minds that . we actively welcome it .
she also goes and says things like , you should eat lots of dark green leaves , because they contain lots of chlorophyll , and that will really oxygenate your blood .
but that 's because people who eat fruit and veg and olive oil , they 're freaks , they 're not normal , they 're like you ; they come to events like this .
but that sounds really techie .
but actually in a lot of situations that 's wrong .
so how does this work ?
this is a graph demonstrating the presence of publication bias in studies of publication bias .
this is a problem that is currently lacking a solution .
you can 't just tell a one sided story .
but if you think the chinanet is something like a deadland , wasteland , i think it 's wrong .
for example , mubarak , he shut down the internet .
and also , recently , very funny debate between the beijing environment ministry and the american embassy in beijing because the ministry blamed the american embassy for intervening in chinese internal politics by disclosing the air quality data of beijing .
" weibo " is the chinese translation for " microblog " .
so this weibo social media , even in the censorship , still gave the chinese a real chance for 300 million people every day chatting together , talking together .
so they can use the 1984 scenario data mining of the dissident .
because he was a very popular leftist leader , so the central government wanted to purge him , and he was very cute , he convinced all the chinese people , why he is so bad .
don 't let them hook [ up ] with the chinese cats .
so , i hope to pierce that prejudice forever with this group .
we exhale carbon dioxide , so does mycelium .
they came to land 1.3 billion years ago , and plants followed several hundred million years later .
sunlight was cut off , and fungi inherited the earth .
they 're very large .
as a treatment against consumption .
and we 're using a natural extract within the same dosage window as a pure pharmaceutical .
and so my house came down , i received my first patent against carpenter ants , termites and fire ants .
now , three corncobs , no other grain -- lots of mushrooms begin to form .
and our system was rudimentary . it was very basic .
so what we find is that there is this great deal of wasted crisis information because there is just too much information for us to actually do anything with right now .
so , thank you very much .
it 's one of my favorite bathing suits .
most of the oxygen in the atmosphere is generated by the sea .
to see -- wait a minute , we can go kshhplash ! -- right there , ha -- under the ocean , see what the whales see .
millions of tons of discarded fishing nets , gear that continues to kill .
half the coral reefs are still in pretty good shape , a jeweled belt around the middle of the planet .
or the antarctic , where the continent is protected , but the surrounding ocean is being stripped of its krill , whales and fish .
i wish you would use all means at your disposal -- films , expeditions , the web , new submarines -- and campaign to ignite public support for a global network of marine protected areas -- hope spots large enough to save and restore the ocean , the blue heart of the planet .
in a country of only seven million people , one and a half million were murdered by their own leaders , their bodies piled in the mass graves of the killing fields .
and she decided , despite the advice of her neighbors , that she would take the chance and claim to be vietnamese so that we could have a chance to survive , because at this point they 're forcing everybody to work .
and i got word last month that the complaint was officially accepted by the khmer rouge tribunal .
van meegeren was charged with the crime of treason , which is itself punishable by death .
he had discovered after all that the painting he thought was this was actually that .
so take food .
but if you believe you 're drinking expensive stuff , parts of the brain associated with pleasure and reward light up like a christmas tree .
this was recorded in 1931 .
so one answer was george clooney .
i think this approach can explain differences in people 's taste in art .
apparently to really enjoy the music of joshua bell , you have to know you 're listening to joshua bell .
the first shock is recorded as very painful .
and i was certain that 's what my life would be .
and i find myself now in the unlikely position of standing in front of all of you as a professional classical composer and conductor .
and then as the videos started to come in ...
i 'll stop it there in the interest of time .
and there were 900 people involved in that .
so two things struck me deeply about this .
africa can only be transformed by enlightened leaders .
and her recommendation is take this opportunity to fire everyone , start all over again .
now , i was 16 . i was very worried about what my peers at school might think if they saw me running up and down this hill .
in my economics classes i got high marks for my understanding of basic economics .
somebody trained them to do the work that they do .
very little emphasis on ethics , and the typical graduate from a university in ghana has a stronger sense of entitlement than a sense of responsibility .
and it is an awesome thing to be a part of empowering someone in this way .
it says a lot about her peers who elected her .
one day in 1819 , 3,000 miles off the coast of chile , in one of the most remote regions of the pacific ocean , 20 american sailors watched their ship flood with seawater .
it 's easiest to see this link between fear and the imagination in young children , whose fears are often extraordinarily vivid .
but they knew that the sheer length of this journey would stretch their supplies of food and water .
and humans , by the way , are the only creatures capable of thinking about the future in this way , of projecting ourselves forward in time , and this mental time travel is just one more thing that fears have in common with storytelling .
after much deliberation , the men finally made a decision .
properly read , our fears can offer us something as precious as our favorite works of literature : a little wisdom , a bit of insight and a version of that most elusive thing -- the truth .
there 's also a fascinating connection to cancer here , because people with neurologic diseases have a very low incidence of most cancers .
i want to take something rather humble to discuss .
chairs : recycled and recyclable .
if you can see this orange tree , it 's actually growing in a car tire , which has been turned inside out and sewn up .
i don 't know how many worms [ were ] in there , but i 've got some heavy karma coming , i tell you .
in the canal , which is just outside the restaurant , there is hundreds of meters of coil piping .
i 've kept the tiles ; i 've kept the floors ; i 've kept the trunking ; i 've got in some recycled fridges ; i 've got some recycled tills ; i 've got some recycled trolleys .
i 'm here today to show my photographs of the lakota .
what is known as the bureau of indian affairs was created within the war department , setting an early tone of aggression in our dealings with the native americans .
1871 : the indian appropriation act makes all indians wards of the federal government .
reservations are cut up into 160-acre sections and distributed to individual indians with the surplus disposed of .
they were tired of treaties .
the tuberculosis rate on pine ridge is approximately eight times higher than the u.s. national average .
is any of this your responsibility today ?
we all , i think , believe in compassion .
you have to , of course , be aware of the needs of others , but you have to be aware in such a way that you can carry on with your life and be of help to people .
all these three things , then , have to be melded together .
because that 's how long they say it takes for this dough to become leaven .
ah , what a wonderful smell . "
and the poor man said , " and you mean god didn 't answer my pleas ? "
i married my high school sweetheart , jane .
i saw new and previously unthinkable possibilities to live and contribute , both for myself and others in my circumstance .
okay , henry , have you been to d.c. lately ?
i grew up in europe , and world war ii caught me when i was between seven and 10 years old .
so my research has been focused more on -- after finding out these things that actually corresponded to my own experience , i tried to understand : where -- in everyday life , in our normal experience -- do we feel really happy ?
and that sounds like a kind of a romantic exaggeration .
this poet describes it as opening a door that floats in the sky -- a very similar description to what albert einstein gave as to how he imagined the forces of relativity , when he was struggling with trying to understand how it worked .
and we can measure this very precisely , actually , because we give people electronic pagers that go off 10 times a day , and whenever they go off you say what you 're doing , how you feel , where you are , what you 're thinking about .
even though sometimes watching television about seven to eight percent of the time is in flow , but that 's when you choose a program you really want to watch and you get feedback from it .
i came up with the idea of painting shadows .
it just would erase my brush strokes like invisible ink .
when i look around this tedxamsterdam venue , i see a very special audience .
let us cherish the fact that probably most of you have never been close to a gun .
the nazis invaded the netherlands .
then in high school , i was gripped by the stories of the allied soldiers -- soldiers who left the safety of their own homes and risked their lives to liberate a country and a people that they didn 't know .
did we simply lose our beastly impulses for revenge , for violent rituals , for pure rage ?
my soldiers use the gun as an instrument of peace .
i hope you will support our soldiers when they are out there , when they come home and when they are injured and need our care .
one , the red line , is the ratio of british to indian per capita income .
in any case , as you may remember , the great divergence reaches its zenith in the 1970s , some considerable time after decolonization .
it 's the institutions .
there are six which i think explain the great divergence .
property rights : it 's not the democracy , folks ; it 's having the rule of law based on private property rights .
that 's the consumer society , and it propels economic growth more than even technological change itself .
not only has japan been ahead for some time , south korea has gone into third place , and china is just about to overtake germany .
he 's now free again , having been detained , as you know , for some time .
i once asked one of my colleagues at harvard , " hey , is south america part of the west ? "
so don 't fear , this is not going to be a cooking demonstration .
it 's about a traditional way of living .
all that is a real , great improvement , as we shall see .
in the u.s. only one percent of the people are actually farmers .
the costs have been tremendous -- water pollution , all the things you know about , destruction of our habitats .
what they want are implements to increase their production : something to fertilize the soil , something to protect their crop and to bring it to a market .
we need clever low-key mechanization that avoids the problems of the large-scale mechanization that we 've had .
there are also robots , for example , who can recognize weeds with a resolution of half an inch .
there is all kinds of things we can do .
and so as i 'm finishing my bread here -- and i 've been baking it , and i 'll try not to burn my hands .
during the first three years of life , the brain grows to its full size , with most of that growth taking place in the first six months . the brain develops in response to experience and to stimulation .
over the years , many people and news reports have blamed the personnel in the institutions for the harm caused to the children , but often , one member of staff is caring for 10 , 20 , and even 40 children .
if the family 's poor , they find it difficult to visit , and gradually the relationship breaks down .
you know , we wake up in the morning , you get dressed , put on your shoes , you head out into the world .
the other guy was still working on me , collapsing my other lung , and i managed to , by hitting that guy , to get a minute .
and later on , when i got out and the flashbacks and the nightmares were giving me a hard time , i went back to him and i was sort of asking him , you know , what am i gonna do ?
so the question is , why is that ?
and that is the perspective i have , and then i can start my story .
the vast rural areas , where 100 million people lived , there were no telephones .
and chris is a fisherman farmer . both are generalists .
in the united states , we have -- everybody needs a banking service , but very few of us are trying to buy a bank .
so i started focusing . what is it that they really do ?
now , about that cow model i talked about .
" the poor are uneducated and cannot do much . "
how does this happen ?
now , why does this happen ?
there are , in fact , 30 areas in the back of your brain concerned with just vision , and after processing all that , the message goes to a small structure called the fusiform gyrus , where you perceive faces .
or terror , as the case may be ? right ?
so this explains why through the phone he recognizes his mother , no problem .
it 's fixed in a clenched spasm and it 's excruciatingly painful .
how do you unlearn the learned paralysis , so you can relieve him of this excruciating , clenching spasm of the phantom arm ?
and he started giggling , he says , " i can see my phantom . "
so he said ok , and he took it home .
it goes into a sort of denial -- it gates the signals .
one of the two aspects of this problem are very intriguing .
and that is , there is an abnormal gene , a mutation in the gene that causes this abnormal cross wiring .
here , you 've got martian alphabet .
sorry about that .
but the mineral wealth of africa is not being utilized to lift its people out of poverty .
capital flight out of africa , 80 billion a year .
i let that pass .
take any african economy .
traditionally , africans hate governments . they hate tyranny .
the extended family system pools its resources together .
that 's where you find the african people .
and i know that with the cheetahs , we can take africa back one village at a time .
we have the ability to get those groups of people around us that want to kind of build that dream with us , and i think if we could get kids to embrace the idea at a young age of being entrepreneurial , we could change everything in the world that is a problem today .
we didn 't fit in the normal work . we couldn 't work for somebody else because we 're too stubborn and we have all these other traits .
so i just figured that out earlier .
and my mom came into the room and she said , " where are you going to get the coat hangers to sell to the dry cleaners ? "
and he 's like , " well , we don 't need one . "
i also learned , don 't reveal your source , because i got beat up after about four weeks of doing this because one of the rich kids found out where i was buying my comics from , and he didn 't like the fact that he was paying a lot more .
and making money off that too .
i would caddy , i would go to the golf course and caddy for people .
you can 't do it on stage .
supply , demand , big opportunity .
you breed that kind of stuff . each of my kids has two piggy banks .
when you see grumpy customer service , point that out to them .

bringing people face to face with our objects is a way of bringing them face to face with people across time , across space , whose lives may have been very different to our own , but who , like us , had hopes and dreams , frustrations and achievements in their lives . and i think this is a process that helps us better understand ourselves , helps us make better decisions about where we 're going .
this means that quantum theory has got to be in some sense true .
and the familiar illustration is the nucleus of an atom is a fly in the middle of a sports stadium and the next atom is in the next sports stadium .
unaided human intuition schooled in middle world finds it hard to believe galileo when he tells us a heavy object and a light object , air friction aside , would hit the ground at the same instant .

if life has arisen only once on any -- if -- if life could -- i mean , life could originate once per planet , could be extremely common , or it could originate once per star , or once per galaxy or maybe only once in the entire universe , in which case it would have to be here . and somewhere up there would be the chance that a frog would turn into a prince and similar magical things like that .
the economically useful way to model a person is to treat him as a purposeful , goal-seeking agent with pleasures and pains , desires and intentions , guilt , blame-worthiness .

the general point is that when we think about economics we have this beautiful view of human nature .
well , i learned a lot about interesting things that i knew nothing about at the time , but grew to know stuff about .
thanks . so , visual music : rhythm and complexity .
so , complexity . now , how many here are jugglers ?
now , do me a favor : follow the ball that i ask you to follow .
now , one more time , and -- finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger . open .
does it really have anything to do with anything in my life ?
a moment -- no , we 'll try that again . it separates , and comes back together .
hup . now , it 's dependent on rhythm , and keeping a center of balance . when it falls , going underneath .
sometimes these pieces are mathematical , in that way that i look at a shape and say , what about if i use this and this and this .
now , i don 't know exactly where it 's going , but i 've got a bit of effort involved in this thing .
where do we like to kiss people ?
our research has shown that the parents and close loved ones of these children adore them .

so we 've seen that we can change people 's faces .
is this business about appearance and preoccupation with it a western phenomenon ?
we 'd be pretty uncomfortable .
we then put bone and tissue from the back .
just imagine , i can make a biologically-degradable template .
a classic story , the first one which lots of people picked up , was when in march -- on march 10th in fact , soon after ted -- paul clarke , in the u.k. government , blogged , " oh , i 've just got some raw data . here it is , it 's about bicycle accidents . "
how can you use this stuff ?
after the earthquake , immediately , people all over the world , mappers who wanted to help , and could , looked at that imagery , built the map , quickly building it up .
and frank , you 've come to a place in your life , which is astonishing .
i think it was circumstantial .
i do run a kind of a business -- i 've got 120 people and you 've got to pay them , so there 's a lot of responsibility involved -- but the actual work on the project is with , i think , a healthy insecurity .
luckily , today most of the people i 'm working with are people i really like .
siza , on the other hand , continued in portugal where the real stuff was and evolved a modern language that relates to that historic language .
rsw : what 's his schedule on that ?
you 're not going to defy gravity .
and i told her the frank lloyd wright story .
and i 've met with some of these people .
they just brought us there to hustle this group , you know , to create a project .
but i want to turn that upside down for a moment , and get something out on the table and clear the air so to say .
and it all started almost a decade ago , as a young consultant at mckinsey & amp ; company at their first african office in johannesburg .
and the siwa oasis is famous for several things , but the key thing is that it was the place that alexander the great went to when he wanted to find out what his destiny had in store for him .

but that 's looking at the big picture .
bing capital 's acquisition of edcon , a large retailer , is testimony to the confidence they are starting to place in the economy .

uganda : the new forest company , replanting and redeveloping their forests . why is that important ?
in 2005 , the egyptian stock exchange returned over 145 percent .
it 's the 24-hour rolling african news channel .
and it 's really rather better not to mate with yourself .
it 's also very biologically active , as anyone with hay fever will understand .
you can tell that from the little barbs on there .
and finally , in a rather grizzly way , the bosnia war crimes ; some of the people brought to trial were brought to trial because of the evidence from pollen , which showed that bodies had been buried , exhumed and then reburied somewhere else .
but we 're spending 36 percent .
now he 's put together some thoughts : about half of that he 'll cut , another half , perhaps in a very complex set of steps , taxes will be approved .
in fact , there 's about five states that are worse and only really four states that don 't face this big challenge .
well we need money to experiment with that , to get those tools in there .
we need better tools .
and just look at what happened with the tuitions with the university of california and project that out for another three , four , five years -- it 's unaffordable .
ham and i took two years off as a side project to sequence the human genome , but as soon as that was done we got back to the task at hand .
and we knew , once that worked , that we actually had a chance if we could make the synthetic chromosomes to do the same with those .
and dan led the team for the synthesis of this over one-million-base pair chromosome .
so , there are four major watermarks all over 1,000 base pairs of genetic code .
i 'm not sure we 're the ones that should be explaining how significant it is .
and what that truly ghastly , awful sound does is stop the single most important behavioral experience that we have , and that 's sleep .
what do we do in the 20th century about sleep ?
all of those combine , and they send projections down to the brain stem here .
now , that 's the equivalent of a hot dog bun .
huge sectors of society are sleep-deprived , and let 's look at our sleep-o-meter .
and in the investigations that followed those disasters , poor judgment as a result of extended shift work and loss of vigilance and tiredness was attributed to a big chunk of those disasters .
so there 's a link between tiredness and the metabolic predisposition for weight gain .
what do you do ?
and what you need to do is listen to your body .
their sleep was absolutely smashed .
stabilize sleep in those individuals who are vulnerable , we can certainly make them healthier , but also alleviate some of the appalling symptoms of mental illness .
and my dad said , " well , we believe in the catholic church that god knows that little kids don 't know the difference between right and wrong , but when you 're seven , you 're old enough to know better .
there 's only one obvious conclusion to reach from this mountain of evidence : our family was too strange and weird for even santa claus to come visit , and my poor parents were trying to protect us from the embarrassment , this humiliation of rejection by santa , who was jolly -- but , let 's face it , he was also very judgmental .
i had a huge virgo poster in my bedroom , and i read my horoscope every single day , and it was so totally me .
and i thought , " well , of course i believe in god , but , you know , i don 't like that word , heart , because it anthropomorphizes god , and i don 't like the word , ' his , ' either , because that sexualizes god . "

i said , " oh -- now , i don 't have a uterus because i had cancer a few years ago . so , does this mean that if i went to heaven i would get my old uterus back ? " and they said , " sure . "
if we were having this ted meeting in our grandparents ' day , that might not be so big a claim .
they often say , " oh , tiny . i feel tiny and insignificant . "
of course we all here in this room live in biosphere 1 .
this is a chamber that was 1 / 400th the size of biosphere 2 that we called our test module .
this is the agriculture .
but our oxygen was going down faster than our co2 was going up , which was quite unexpected , because we had seen them going in tandem in the test module .
not me , that was for sure .
we stink of hairspray and underarm deodorant , and all kinds of stuff .
eritrea , formerly part of ethiopia , is one of those places that is astonishingly beautiful , incredibly stark , and i have no understanding of how people eke out a living there .
when i 'm modeling a plant in a box , literally , i know where to draw the boundary .
and on sunday morning the neighbors leaf blower comes out , and i want to throttle them .

take meeker , mt . meeker . lump that in there , and put that in space as well , and mt . everest , and k2 , and the indian peaks .
there is a median point between tiny rock and gigantic rock , and in fact , if any of you have ever been to near winslow , arizona , there is a crater in the desert there that is so iconic that it is actually called meteor crater .
they don 't have to do global devastation .
the national science foundation , other countries are very interested in doing this .
the purpose wasn 't to push it out of the way .
and this is the part , it 's the part i just love .
they 're a hundred years ahead of us with this drive . "
and as i 'm watching it , i 'm realizing that they 're talking about me .
i get stuck in traffic -- evil , evil traffic .
so i wear this whenever i have to do something that makes me a little nervous , like , i don 't know , a tedx talk .

that 's the only reason that a landlord needs to have them removed , because there 's no protection from discrimination of glbt people .
he is starting a new club at school , policy debate .
thank you .
but this project changed the way that i thought about connecting to people .
we have to remix it . he 's got a great voice .
and it 's sort of a metaphor for me for the virtual world .
" they used some of the morbidly artist footage , a close-up of chad 's shoes in the middle of the highway .
" from 52 to 48 with love " was a project around the time of the last election cycle , where mccain and obama both , in their speeches after the election , talked about reconciliation , and i was like , " what the hell does that look like ? "
but this was the emotional moment .
so , you know , people were writing me and saying , " how 's your new job ? "
and then a few days later i sent her this .
this will make it possible for anyone to collect life-saving information and to monitor water quality conditions as they unfold .
i teach at stanford .
she says , " i did . "
and basically everything we know about percussion , which you can think of as an ultrasound of its day -- organ enlargement , fluid around the heart , fluid in the lungs , abdominal changes -- all of this he described in this wonderful manuscript " inventum novum , " " new invention , " which would have disappeared into obscurity , except for the fact that this physician , corvisart , a famous french physician -- famous only because he was physician to this gentleman -- corvisart repopularized and reintroduced the work .
and hence the painting " the doctor , " a very famous painting .
this is when i was in texas .
they have often been rejected by their families , have had bad experiences with medical care and they come to you fully prepared for you to join the long list of people who 's about to disappoint them .
and i would lay out all the standard treatment options that the patient had heard elsewhere .
i would look at the tongue .
i will see you through this .
i think they wanted to believe that the most expensive bottle of wine in the world must be the best bottle of wine in the world , must be the rarest bottle of wine in the world .
to try this , i went to a mario batali restaurant in manhattan -- del posto .
this is soap that 's made from silver nanoparticles , which have antibacterial properties .
i don 't play golf , so i couldn 't actually road test these , but i did interview a guy who owns them .
there 's a water jet that cleans you .
it was such a smooth ride .
bipin desai is a u.c. riverside theoretical physicist who also happens to be the preeminent organizer of rare wine tastings , and he said , " i 've got a tasting coming up where we 're going to serve the ' 47 cheval blanc . "
well , that 's kind of an obvious statement up there .
so when they spoke into it , the computer typed out gibberish , so they said , " well , it doesn 't understand anything of what we are saying . "
sm : and i asked him , " do you send emails ? "
and i set myself and impossible target : can tamil speaking 12-year-old children in a south indian village teach themselves biotechnology in english on their own ?
remember , they don 't study english .
i said , " you make your own groups of four .
i have further results , which are almost unbelievable , of scores which go up with time .
after watching eight tedtalks , he wants to become leonardo da vinci .
it 's pitagora . "
and we go to live concerts , and we get that as much as we can .
he just got tired of being in front of an audience , and felt like -- a performing monkey was , in fact , his term .
before " jurassic park , " there was no science for how skin hung off of muscle , right ?
what you heard today was not perfect .
it 's now coming in this world .
it was a concert he recorded in the shrine auditorium in 1949 .
not bad , except if you look at that cover , what 's missing ?
and if you 'll begin to look closely at the husky that 's bearing her throat to the polar bear , and look a little more closely , they 're in an altered state .
and so now i 'm going to take you through sort of a way of looking at play , but it 's never just singularly one thing .
but it has to be safe exploration .
well , this bushman , i think , is talking about the fish that got away that was that long , but it 's a fundamental part of the play scene .
they both hide out .
now , jane goodall has here a play face along with one of her favorite chimps .
he had the expectations of his senatorial father and washington , d.c.
some sage and repeatedly furry monks at this place called the d.school designed a meeting that you can literally step out of when it 's over .
so it 's not just something you do in your spare time .
but i have for you a very simple message that offers more hope than you can imagine .
almost everybody knows this , from nobel laureates to golf caddies , or was taught it , as i was .
so i then began looking at all the research plots i could over the whole of the western united states where cattle had been removed to prove that it would stop desertification , but i found the opposite , as we see on this research station , where this grassland that was green in 1961 , by 2002 had changed to that situation .
and we are burning in africa , every single year , more than one billion hectares of grasslands , and almost nobody is talking about it .
so rather than reinvent the wheel , i began studying other professions to see if anybody had .
i began helping a family in the karoo desert in the 1970s turn the desert that you see on the right there back to grassland , and thankfully , now their grandchildren are on the land with hope for the future .
how do you start ?
but when i don 't know and when i haven 't been asked , that 's when the problem arises .
so i sent her online , of course , to look it up .
imagine in the physical world if somebody followed our children around with a camera and a notebook and recorded their every movement .
now at the time that i was reading this , it was the middle of the winter and i definitely did not have room for a lot of dirt in my new york city apartment .
and we have window farms all over the world .
open source projects tend to have a momentum of their own .
a student said , " this class felt like sitting in a bar with a really smart friend who 's explaining something you haven 't grasped , but are about to . "
so we brought back the innovation of having due dates .
but to me , the most exciting part of it is the data that we 're gathering .
is that you were the better man , in the end ; you were the better man , my friend .
never surrender the future you earned .
count thy sheep and not thy years .
i hope you know that now .
what of the temples of justice , whose servants enslave us all ?
from 40 to 50 , grown easy and sly , i wined them and dined them , like pigs in a sty .
not with much success .
i spent eight years running one of the most successful publishing businesses in the world .
we dabbled and babbled , denying our thirsts .
she thought he must just have been worn out by the work .
but gayla didn 't stop . she kept doing research .
you can see willful blindness in the catholic church , where decades of child abuse went ignored .
so there 's this profound mythology around whistleblowers which says , first of all , they 're all crazy .
i 'm going to take on the naysayers , because they 'll make my argument better and stronger .
but there 's no agenda .
there 's the moderator who has no idea how to run the meeting .
and if the numbers — there are a million views and it 's being used by all these companies — aren 't enough proof that we have a global problem with meetings , there are the many , many thousands of comments posted online after the video went up .
or the maybe button , or whatever button is there for you not to accept immediately .
he was talking about the space aliens .
that 's -- that 's not true .
and then they stopped , and the man turned to me and said , " what are you looking for , flying saucers ? "
and they turned at once and walked away .
i was merely a connoisseur of movies featuring desert planets , as i still am .
in the mid-to-late ' 80s , the novelist whitley strieber wrote a book called " communion , " in which he described his own lifelong experiences being abducted by aliens .
some years later , i and this woman -- we 'll call her " catherine fletcher " -- -- went traveling through the south of portugal together .
i had my own " lost time " moment , where i woke up and suddenly realized it was very late in the day , almost dinnertime , and she had not come back .
she was smiling . she did not understand why i was so worried .
it was neutral , impassive and even , after a while , strangely companionate and reassuring , although i did notice that its calm exterior sometimes slipped and that it occasionally mirrored my own unexpressed emotion .
they told me , for example , that if i proved myself worthy of their help , then they could change my life back to how it had been , and a series of increasingly bizarre tasks was set , a kind of labor of hercules .
so for example , voices which threatened to attack my home i learned to interpret as my own sense of fear and insecurity in the world , rather than an actual , objective danger .
and i remember the most moving and extraordinary moment when supporting another young woman who was terrorized by her voices , and becoming fully aware , for the very first time , that i no longer felt that way myself but was finally able to help someone else who was .
ban-gap-seum-ni-da .
just play your life with all you have , and share it with the world .
and after doing this for a long time , and the media lab passing the baton on , i thought , " well , maybe it 's time for me to do a project .
and when people tell me , " who 's going to teach the teachers to teach the kids ? "
whether we sell , it doesn 't make any difference whatsoever .
we were using it at lunch today in the sunlight , and the more sunlight the better .
they 're not going to be near another laptop , so you have to nail these onto a tree , and sort of , get it .
in each case , got the ministers , went through a lot of the stuff .
and the " give one , get one " program is really important because it got a lot of people absolutely interested .
but a million a month in laptop-land is a big number .
most people are entirely unconscious of these filters .
in this scenario , nobody 's listening to anybody .
so even if you 're in a noisy environment like this -- and we all spend a lot of time in places like this -- listen in the coffee bar to how many channels of sound can i hear ?
do you remember , i gave you those filters at the beginning .
i want what i can 't have , need what i can 't want have what i don 't have , what i want what i can 't have , need what i can 't want have what i don 't have , what i want what i can 't have , need what i can 't want have what i don 't have , what i want what i can 't have , need what i can 't want have what i don 't have , what i want what i can 't have , need what i can 't want have but i don 't have it feels like all i got is loss on a bad back gone with the last train , honey don 't you fret every cloud has a silver lining just a little rain , just a little rain , just a little rain i want what i can 't have , need what i can 't want have what i don 't have , what i want what i can 't have , need what i can 't want have but i don 't have my mind won 't stop , and my heart says go nobody knows how to hold me my mind won 't stop , and my heart says , " good things come to those who wait " and i can 't stand in ... i can 't stand in line forever stand the cold air glad-handed sick and tired of the " later , maybe " take it , fake it , take it , take-it-or-leave-it life and i gotta just tame it i gotta just name it i gotta just seize , so please , oh please , oh please , oh please oh please me right , ' cause my mind won 't stop and my heart says go nobody knows how to hold me my mind won 't stop -- and my heart says go-ooooo ... good things must be here -- yes , right here here , right here , right here i won 't live this life forever one time round is all the offer is sick and tired of the " later , maybe " take it , fake it , make it , leave it life and i gotta just name it , i gotta just claim it i gotta just seize oh please , oh please , oh please me right i want what i can 't have , need what i can 't want have what i don 't have , what i want what i can 't have , need what i can 't want have but i don 't have -- you know that my mind won 't stop , and my heart says go nobody knows how to hold me , no my mind won 't stop , and my heart says go ' cause i want what i can 't have , need what i can 't want have but i -- have what i want what i can 't have , need what i can 't want what i can 't have , need what i can 't want have but i don 't have , what i want what i can 't have , need what i can 't want have what i don 't have , what i want what i can 't have , need what i can 't want have but i don 't have , what i want what i can 't have , need what i can 't want have but i don 't have what i want
it literally flat-lined .
i 've shared with you so far some insights into the world of experts .
encouraging dissent is a rebellious notion because it goes against our very instincts , which are to surround ourselves with opinions and advice that we already believe or want to be true .
and when evolutionary biologists talk about design , they really mean design by natural selection .
so , if the pathogen doesn 't need the host to be healthy and active , and actual selection favors pathogens that take advantage of those hosts , the winners in the competition are those that exploit the hosts for their own reproductive success .
but it doesn 't tell you how long .
some countries that might have clean water supplies , so that you can 't get waterborne transmission : you expect the organism to evolve to mildness there .
each dot corresponds to an islet from a different person -- a lot of variation on which natural selection can act .
so , you get this vicious cycle .
in the case of malaria , what we 'd like to do is mosquito-proof houses .
every row across here represents one of those 11 zones .
and so if you do something with those systems , they 're going to evolve one way or another .
but there is a saying in my culture that if a bud leaves a tree without saying something , that bud is a young one .
and , as a consequence , the western view of africa 's economic dilemma is framed wrongly .
so , where should we be putting the money ?
under the cotonou agreement , formerly known as the lome convention , african countries have been given an opportunity by europe to export goods , duty-free , to the european union market .
if the government 's fiscal survival depends on it having to raise money from its own people , such a government is driven by self-interest to govern in a more enlightened fashion .
because they don 't need to talk to their own citizens .
and when they see him physically , it is at public functions like this , and even there , it is him who advises them .
it was really a fascinating journey .
and i have to say , thank god .
and you can see there they 're shopping with their helmets .
and i finally have stabilized .
so as a patriot , i felt it was important to -- i wear all the earplugs and the earphones , and it 's really improved my life in a surprising and unexpected way .
we finally , after 40 years of knowing that wholegrain was a healthier option , we 're finally getting to the point where we actually are tipping over and attempting to actually eat them .
and so , if we can release some of those , they become accessible to us in our palate .
then we get into fermentation , the third stage , which is really where the flavor develops .
the sugars in the dough caramelize in the crust .
but let 's kind of look at these stages again from the standpoint of connections to possibly a deeper level -- all in my quest for answering the question , " what is it about bread that 's so special ? "
the first transformation -- and , by the way , the definition of transformation for me is a radical change from one thing into something else .
bacteria is in there , eating the same sugars , turning them into acids .
and it 's what comes out of the oven that is what we call the staff of life .
i 'll leave you with what i call the baker 's blessing .
so this brings me to a quieter , small work called handheld .
it appears to be mass-manufactured like it came out of a factory like vacuum cleaners and washing machines .
okay , this is the last work . it 's called the framerunners .
he stands there , and he looks across at the island , sado .
the system isn 't chesapeake bay .
that 's one of the themes that sylvia reminds us about : understand this ocean of ours , this basic life support system , the dominant life support system on the planet .
and i share with you some very high-definition video that we collected in real time .
the computational power is amazing .
and the cables go really continent to continent .
there will be massive amounts of data flowing ashore , all available to anyone who has any interest in using it .
there are many kinds of things that can be used in the ocean , continuously .
and they fly into the erupting volcano .
and cantor decided he was going to take a line and erase the middle third of the line , and then take those two resulting lines and bring them back into the same process , a recursive process .
and then in 1977 , benoit mandelbrot , a french mathematician , realized that if you do computer graphics and used these shapes he called fractals , you get the shapes of nature .
so they 're mapping the social scaling onto the geometric scaling ; it 's a conscious pattern . it is not unconscious like a termite mound fractal .
and they said , " well , we can take you there , but you can 't go inside because that 's the sacred altar , where we do sacrifices every year to keep up those annual cycles of fertility for the fields . "
second , you might ask , " well , dr. eglash , aren 't you ignoring the diversity of african cultures ? "
you learn the next level of knowledge .
so these guys are right on target for a practical use of scaling technology .
even plus even gives you even . odd plus odd gives you even .
we 've found statistically significant improvement with children using this software in a mathematics class in comparison with a control group that did not have the software .
thank you .
i 'll get into why that is in just a minute .
over time , those gas molecules dissolve into your blood and tissues and start to fill you up .
so that 's the basic concept that we use .
three , they allow you to go deeper .
and that , fittingly enough , is called the diluent gas supply .
i 'm going to show you what it 's like to do one of these dives that we do .
this is papua , new guinea .
more people are killed by pigs , more people are killed by lightning strikes , more people are killed at soccer games in england .
and i remember coming up from one of these deep dives , and i had this fog , and the narcosis takes a little while to , you know , fade away .
now , if you go to an amazon jungle and fog a tree , you may get a lot of bugs , but for fishes , there 's nowhere in the world you can get seven new species per hour of time .
so , i guess my theme on this is this guy lived his life to the fullest , he absolutely did .
like , what have i got to say about all this ?
that 's very important .
it can only be understood in the context of story , and everything , all of this is story .
so what seems like an eccentric if tragic joke about harry becomes a way to spread ethnic hatred .
i grew up very privileged , and it 's important to talk about privilege , because we don 't talk about it here .
idris pauses , then he moves again , and fraser says , " please !
have i not myself been beaten ? "
my friend ronald gottesman says there are three kinds of people in the world : those who can count , and those who can 't .
thank you .
and after two more years of studying music , i decided to shoot for the impossible before taking the mcat and applying to medical school like a good indian son to become the next dr. gupta .
and for those living in the most dehumanizing conditions of mental illness within homelessness and incarceration , the music and the beauty of music offers a chance for them to transcend the world around them , to remember that they still have the capacity to experience something beautiful and that humanity has not forgotten them .
well , this is how i approached it . this is what i did .
i 'd like to get into android programming and development , and i 'd like to continue my app club , and find other ways for students to share knowledge with others . thank you .
ss : well , it 's an important part of the journey . so i had -- tedwomen -- the original one was in d.c. -- so i live here , so i had gotten on a plane the day before , and my daughter was three , she was clinging to my leg : " mommy , don 't go . "
and what really mattered to me -- it wasn 't only women in the corporate world , even though i did hear from a lot of them , and it did impact a lot of them , it was also people of all different circumstances .
it 's a word that 's pretty much not used for little boys , because if a little boy leads , there 's no negative word for it , it 's expected . but if a little girl leads , she 's bossy .
so in the months that have come since the book , in which " lean in " focused on that and said , here are some of the challenges that remain , and many of them we have to own within ourselves and look at ourselves . what has changed ?
i looked at them , we went around and introduced ourselves , and they all said their names and where they 're from , and i said , i 'm sheryl sandberg , and this was my dream .
there is a circle that 's been started for rescued sex workers in miami .
we shy away from the word " feminist , " a word i really think we need to embrace .
your skin gets more blood flow when you change your lifestyle , so you age less quickly . your skin doesn 't wrinkle as much .
so i want to talk today about money and happiness , which are two things that a lot of us spend a lot of our time thinking about , either trying to earn them or trying to increase them .
and another person wrote , " i would fill a big bathtub with money and get in the tub while smoking a big fat cigar and sipping a glass of champagne . "
so some people got this slip of paper and five dollars .
what really matters is that you spent it on somebody else rather than on yourself .
but then we see extraordinary differences .
we also wanted to go even broader and look at every country in the world if we could to see what the relationship is between money and happiness .
some teams , we give people on the team some money for themselves and say , " spend it however you want on yourself , " just like we did with the undergrads in canada .
the teams that spend money on themselves are just the same winning percentages as they were before .
i 've been telling a story that has been so painful for me .
and not only that , when i was eight i became a child soldier .
my dreams are like torment .
as a child so young and tender , words i can 't forget i still remember .
i ate snails , vultures , rabbits , snakes , and anything that had life .
so now i 'm doing music so i know what the power of music is .
but that moved me .
and i said " i 'm going to put it in practice . "
i 'm going to show you how terrorism actually interacts with our daily life .
i actually had failed the psychological profiling of a terrorist .
and he told me that the best time of his life was when he was a member of the red brigades and he went sailing , every summer , back and forth from lebanon , where he would pick up soviet weapons from the plo , and then carry them all the way to sardinia where the other arms organization from europe would go and take their share of the arms .
so , state sponsor of terrorism , feature of the cold war .
rogue economics is a force which is constantly lurking in the background of history .
the united states actually is a country that is the reserve currency of the world .
and this is what people did .
i was thrilled to get it . i was thrilled to be the only person standing on the stage with a shiny silver helmet .
and we need to start authoring processes again instead of authoring objects .
well , how about instead of doing that , we roll up to the gates something they want .
the second issue is a nuance of the first .
but also to challenge the notion of suspension of disbelief such that in the last act of macbeth , if he or she wants you to associate the parable that you 're seeing with dallas , with your real life , he or she can do so .
it is taking the hand of the architect to actually remove the hand of the architect in favor of the hand of the artistic director .
the second technology that we applied was actually using things that you know from the stage side of an opera house .
and again , this is not all the flexibilities of the building that is actually built , but at least suggests the ideas .
i promise .
now it 's actually very simple to put a face to many of these monsters .
it starts with a single sheet of paper .
so what i would like to do is , if we could dim the lights , please , it turns out foldscopes are also projection microscopes .
so that 's where the lenses go .
mapping is , of course , not just about cartography , it 's also about imagery .
there are several reasons why this is interesting and one of them , of course , is time travel .
ok , ok , back to the corner , back to the corner , back to the corner .
so , this is an astronomically complete representation of the sky integrated right into the earth .
and 20,000 kids have been taken away to become child soldiers , and the international criminal court is going after five of the leaders of the -- now , what 's it called ?
i fell . they ran to join the others ... leaving me for dead .
pg : witness was born of technological innovation -- in a sense the small , portable , dv cam was really what allowed it to come into being .
i sat there on the river for two months without seeing one .
you glaze over with it .
they 're not going to die of hypothermia .
here 's me in my office .
this very whale right here could be over 250 years old .
as a species , as humans , we like to say penguins are really cute , therefore , leopard seals eat them , so leopard seals are ugly and bad .
and what it 's trying to do is turn that penguin inside-out , so it can eat the meat off the bones , and then it goes off and gets another one .
but i just started to shoot these pictures .
and she would often stop and have this dejected look on her face like , " are you for real ? "
it 's a story that lives deep in my heart , and i 'm proud to share this with you .
why strangeness ? because our social relations are increasingly mediated by data , and data turns our social relations into digital relations , and that means that our digital relations now depend extraordinarily on technology to bring to them a sense of robustness , a sense of discovery , a sense of surprise and unpredictability .
they produce sameness .
we have to change the norms in order to enable new kinds of technologies as a basis for new kinds of businesses .
all this time i lived in the city because , to be honest , i was afraid of trees .
oh sure , sure , i had moments of appreciation of my body , the way an abusive parent can sometimes have a moment of kindness .
i went outside what i thought i knew .
it was as if i was living in a stagnant pool and cancer dynamited the boulder that was separating me from the larger sea .
the flowers make it beautiful , and the honey makes it sweet . "
it was the realization that i had come very close to dying -- in the same way that the earth , our mother , is barely holding on , in the same way that 75 percent of the planet are hardly scraping by , in the same way that there is a recipe for survival .
four years earlier , when i was one , after the chernobyl accident , the rain came down black , and my sister 's hair fell out in clumps , and i spent nine months in the hospital .
everyone 's upset .
what 's happening in genomics , and how this revolution is about to change everything we know about the world , life , ourselves , and how we think about them .
the dna is organized in words , call them : genes and chromosomes .
and look at all the complex things and wonderful things we 've been able to create with just a one and a zero .
you might also be interested in knowing that a mouse has about the same amount of genes .
in other words , the first couple of sentences here , assuming this is a grape plant : make a root , make a branch , create a blossom .
if you have a uti , you 've probably -- or ever had a uti -- you 've come in contact with this little bug .
they 're not grown from seeds ; they 're grafted into root stock ; they would not exist in nature on their own .
i 've got this piece of land and it creates terroir like you wouldn 't believe .
so , what 's happening today is , nature is presenting us with a toolbox , and we find that this toolbox is very extensive .
this dolphin has self-awareness .
they are not persons , but they 're personalities in every sense of the word .
they imitated on their own .
she discovers a note she likes , finds the octave .
now we started talking with ted about how you bring dolphins and great apes and elephants to ted , and we realized that wouldn 't work .
they 're not really used to having cameras here at 8 o 'clock at night .
that 's a number only that congress can appreciate .
now , there is a project that 's underway called the interplanetary internet .
what 's special about it ?
if , of course , that were true , there would be no innovation , and nobody could make any money .
china has an energy policy based on radical energy efficiency and leap-frog technology .
and protect another million jobs now at risk , mainly in auto-making .
again , much cheaper than buying the fuel .
because these materials could actually absorb six to 12 times as much energy per pound as steel , and do so a lot more smoothly .
and then another six can be made robustly , competitively , from cellulosic ethanol and a little bio-diesel , without interfering at all with the water or land needs of crop production .
this creates a new million-car-a-year market for detroit from customers they weren 't going to get otherwise , because they weren 't creditworthy and could never afford a new car .
but here 's how the whole thing fits together .
stepping onto the sidewalk , i then heard the sound of a steel chair slide across the concrete sidewalk in front of me .
in particular , i thought about my dad , who had passed away from complications from brain surgery .
inherent with the training for recovery from sight loss is learning to rely on all your non-visual senses , things that you would otherwise maybe ignore .
it 's like , there was no escape from this man 's death grip , but he got me safely there .
everybody 's welcome .
i am going to talk about myself , which i rarely do , because i -- well for one thing , i prefer to talk about things i know nothing about .
" don 't use big words . "
that 's how you get rationality .
so you can imagine my surprise on reading in the new yorker that alan greenspan , chairman of the federal reserve , claims ayn rand as his intellectual mentor .
i do . i think it can go too far .
there always had to be the butt of a joke .
and then coming to this conference , i realized that most everybody here shared those same qualities because really what trickster is is an agent of change .
if they had had an olympics in martyrdom , my grandmother would have lost on purpose .
i had no joke for that .
yes of course you got that . thank you very much .
but being too prepared doesn 't leave room for the accidents to happen .
but i am angry .
what kind of business model is that ?
so technology has changed . things have changed .
why did we ever do it ?
we didn 't know the role that language , a stimulus and response , call and response , how important that was in developing those children .
but when they really get pushy , people really get pushy , i say , " i do it because you do it for your kid . "
i need that data in september .
we have to innovate . and people in our business get mad about innovation .
our job as educators , there 's some stuff we know that we can do .
a hundred percent of them went to college .
today i 'm going to show you an electric vehicle that weighs less than a bicycle , that you can carry with you anywhere , that you can charge off a normal wall outlet in 15 minutes , and you can run it for 1,000 kilometers on about a dollar of electricity .
thank you .
i just politely raised my hand , and when ms. russell acknowledged me , i said , in front of my year two classmates , and i quote , " but miss , surely if the diagonal of the square is less than the diameter of the circle , well , the square peg will pass quite easily through the round hole . "
the proof of that is a great party trick that admittedly only works at certain parties .
after that point , they thin out a lot .
i 'm in geek heaven . we 'll stop it there for a second .
in a roomful of maths ph.ds , i 'm as dumb as a box of hammers .
this is the first harry potter novel .
we 've heard a lot about robots in this ted .
give it up for the fundamental particle that bequeaths all other fundamental particles their mass .
you see , fire made us human ; fossil fuels made us modern .
we can eliminate our addiction to oil and coal by 2050 and use one-third less natural gas while switching to efficient use and renewable supply .
so sticker prices will ultimately fall to about the same as today , while the driving cost , even from the start , is very much lower .
if we made all of our autos this way , it would save oil equivalent to finding one and a half saudi arabias , or half an opec , by drilling in the detroit formation , a very prospective play .
but no vehicles will need oil .
the key is a disruptive innovation that we call integrative design that often makes very big energy savings cost less than small or no savings .
our team has lately found such snowballing energy savings in more than 30 billion dollars worth of industrial redesigns -- everything from data centers and chip fabs to mines and refineries .
and when a big plant goes down , you lose a thousand megawatts in milliseconds , often for weeks or months , often without warning .
and those utilities were rewarded , as they still are in 34 states , for selling you more electricity .
we humans are inventing a new fire , not dug from below , but flowing from above ; not scarce , but bountiful ; not local , but everywhere ; not transient , but permanent ; not costly , but free .
not just the horses , but people had cows in their attics that they would use for milk , that they would hoist up there and keep them in the attic until literally their milk ran out and they died , and then they would drag them off to the bone boilers down the street .
it 's in the middle of soho , in this working class neighborhood , this little girl becomes sick and it turns out that the cesspool , that they still continue to have , despite the nuisances act , bordered on an extremely popular water pump , local watering hole that was well known for the best water in all of soho , that all the residents from soho and the surrounding neighborhoods would go to .
as you get further and further away from the pump , the deaths begin to grow less and less frequent .
everything was at my feet .
and i thought i 'd start a barefoot college -- college only for the poor .
you have to show that you have a skill that you can offer to the community and provide a service to the community .
it doesn 't matter if you fail .
and i said , " okay , i 'll go to the old man in village and say , ' what should i grow in this spot ? ' " he looked quietly at me and said , " you build this , you build this , you put this , and it 'll work . "
you 'll never find indian women so precise .
she looks after 20 goats in the morning , but she 's prime minister in the evening .
these puppets are made out of recycled world bank reports .
in six months , how do we train these women ?
they said , " these two grandmothers ... " " grandmothers ? " the minister couldn 't believe what was happening .
" why not ? " " the woman , look how beautiful she is . "
thank you .
we inspected schools and private residencies .
on his last job he was working with his boss , and they started pouring the columns wrong .
so the question is , where do we start this story ?
so watch this beetle , and there 's two things that i would like you to be aware of .
what is happening in the sky here is that there 's a great big pattern of polarized light in the sky that you and i can 't see . it 's the way our eyes are built .
so that 's the dance , but after spending many years sitting in the african bush watching dung beetles on nice hot days , we noticed that there was another behavior associated with the dance behavior .
it 's up around 55 to 60 degrees centigrade .
so watch this individual here , and what he 's trying to do is set up a nest .
the forage has been displaced to a new position .
so i used to embark on these imaginary journeys to find intergalactic objects from planet krypton , which was a lot of fun , but didn 't get much result .
in fact , those with the most amazing superpowers are actually children , who smile as many as 400 times per day .
and , unlike lots of chocolate , lots of smiling can actually make you healthier .
unicef reports that in 2011 , 6.9 million children under five died from preventable , poverty-related diseases .
and that might seem surprising , because a lot of people think , " philosophy is remote from the real world ; economics , we 're told , just makes us more selfish , and we know that math is for nerds . "
now , mentioning time might lead you to think , " well , should i abandon my career and put all of my time into saving some of these 19,000 lives that are lost every day ? "
it costs somewhere between 20 and 50 dollars to cure a blind person in a developing country if they have trachoma .
charlie bresler said to me that he 's not an altruist .
well , i have to admit , i 'm also somewhat embarrassed by that , because i still have two kidneys .
now one of the reasons why there are so few trees is this : people need to cook , and they harvest wood and they make charcoal in order to do it .
what we wanted to do is we wanted to make a fuel that used something that was readily available on the local level .
kids and women are especially affected by it , because they 're the ones who are around the cooking fires .
so this is where we 're also moving ahead with our charcoal project .
they can save the money that they were going to spend on charcoal , and they can produce excess and sell it in the market to people who aren 't making their own .
and we need to rethink our development strategies , so that we 're not promoting educational campaigns to get them to stop being farmers , but rather to stop being poor farmers .
some of my most wonderful memories of childhood are of spending time with my grandmother , mamar , in our four-family home in brooklyn , new york .
and even with this high prevalence , women are misdiagnosed between 30 and 50 percent of the time .
and the second is that we aren 't taking what we have learned , and routinely applying it in clinical care .
the plaque is laid down more evenly , more diffusely along the artery , and it 's harder to see .
all three were nonsmokers .
now , it 's clear that our investment in breast cancer has produced results .
so , people often ask me : what can i do ?
so i 've been arguing in the last years that , in fact , the slums of tijuana can teach a lot to the sprawls of san diego when it comes to socioeconomic sustainability , that we should pay attention and learn from the many migrant communities on both sides of this border wall so that we can translate their informal processes of urbanization .
and i 'm talking about how this begins to suggest that the future of southern california depends on the retrofitting of the large urbanization -- i mean , on steroids -- with the small programs , social and economic .
and they began to realize the necessity to organize themselves even deeper and began to fundraise , to organize budgets , to really be aware of all the knowledge embedded in the urban code in san diego so that they could begin to redefine the very meaning of public space in the city , expanding it to other categories .
and as jobs continue to leave my community , and energy continues to come in , be exported in , it 's no wonder that really some people refer to the south bronx as a desert .
and what we do is we partner it with authentic learning experiences , private-based learning .
it gets me to meet incredible contractors like this , jim ellenberger from ellenberger services .
we are poised , ready , willing and able to export our talent and diversity in ways we 've never even imagined .
but more importantly is my kids learned to get , they learned to give .
bissel gardens is cranking out food in epic proportions , moving kids into an economy they never imagined .
or more importantly , to local shelters , where most of our kids are getting one to two meals a day .
mojitos , anybody ? i 'll be at telepan later .
but most importantly , just love them .
i had never heard the word amerasian before .
her mother was still alive .
again , the first one to go to the blackboard to answer questions .
and i said , " i 'm 28 years old , and i live in hotels , and i 'm not married . "
and on christmas day , i was in bangkok with a group of photographers and got a telegram -- back in those days , you got telegrams -- from time magazine saying someone in korea had died , and left their child in a will to me .
i said , " well , tell him that i was asked by this little girl 's grandmother to find a family for her . "
i said , " i don 't know if it 's the right decision or not , but i would like you to come to lunch tomorrow and tell the uncle what it 's like to walk down the street , what people say to you , what you do for a living .
and you can see how different she looks just in three months .
and he said , " the second day she was here she made up a list of all of the names of the older kids and the younger kids .
and gene was showing natasha how to use a knife and fork , and then natasha was returning the utensil lessons .
and i don 't speak korean , but i 'm hearing these voices , and i 'm not hearing anger , i 'm hearing terror .
and the other is unbelievable guilt .
i remember a sort of a tussle at the door , trying to get the door open .
this is father keene with natasha at the bus stop .
natasha told me that a lot of the kids thought she was stuck up , because they would talk to her and she wouldn 't answer , and they didn 't realize she didn 't actually speak english very well , in the beginning .
this is her half-sister .
they might weigh up to two tons .
and the fishermen would tie a net off the headland , string it out along the other net .
and another title would be " liop an da lapa , " the unwieldy beast with two fins .
i only found out last year , at a conference on the isle of man , just how unusual it is to live somewhere where basking sharks regularly , frequently and predictably come to the surface to " bask . "
and of course , sharks , fish , are underwater most of the time .
and that 's why it 's great to have collaboration .
they all basically seem the same .
so where do you get samples from for your genetic analysis ?
so i tried that , i tried many techniques .
so having spent three and a half thousand on satellite tags , i then thought i 'd invest 7.95 -- the price is still on it -- in my local hardware store in kilrush for a mop handle and even less money on some oven cleaners .
so you can quite easily tell the gender of the shark .
so we assembled a team of experts , spanning harvard , mit , the american heritage dictionary , the encyclopedia britannica and even our proud sponsors , the google .
since time immemorial , there have been authors .
now again , we kind of caved in , and we did the very practical approach , which was a bit less awesome .
he 'd say , " well , in my day , most people throve , but some thrived . "
they couldn 't stop talking about all the things they did in 1950 , all the things they were planning to do in 1950 , all the dreams of what they wanted to accomplish in 1950 .
but guess what , nobody will really care .
people talked about it twice less as it should have been .
they didn 't want to be their best , they wanted to be their beft .
and when that happens , that will transform the way we have to understand our past , our present and human culture .
so everybody knew this is a , not a useless project , this is an absolute damaging , a terrible project -- not to speak about the future indebtedness of the country for these hundreds of millions of dollars , and the siphoning off of the scarce resources of the economy from much more important activities like schools , like hospitals and so on .
we will lose to the french , we will lose to the swedes , we 'll lose to the japanese . "
but in the second session , they admitted already that they would never do this , what they are doing in these other countries , here in germany , or in the u.k. , and so on .
let me just try to draw some conclusions from what has happened .
and before that , i was a silversmith , and before that , i was -- i was out of the house at about 15 and a half , and i never wound up going into college .
and it got me through some -- i didn 't make any royalties on this , but it got me through .
and then , i made a lego animator .
and you can see the massively parallel processing nintendos there .
but it 's not how you actually get leverage .
the point of showing these is i 've always been interested in little artificial life pieces .
then i started to get a little more realistic and i have to start drawing the stuff .
and she starts doing all these different drawings and does color patterns and coloring books .
mostly me , because it was all mechanics at this point .
and hasbro made about , you know , a billion and a half dollars .
there 's a book called " walking on eggshells , " where they found actual sauropod skin in patagonia .
the servos in the front legs , we had to shape those like muscles .
this -- i on purpose -- they go through life stages .
and we think we can help that out by having little creatures that you can love .
and there 's a lot of social responsibility in that .
and those are the peat swamp forests on 20 meters of peat , the largest accumulation of organic material in the world .
the climate has changed . i will show you : no more flooding , no more fires .
and then you look at the outputs and you start measuring what comes out .
april .
you don 't need to harvest [ unclear ] or any other of the crops .
the nursery , in here , is quite different .
rainfall is up .
let 's look at the next year , and you can see that that trend is continuing .
they have enough income for three families .
there have been three themes , haven 't there , running through the conference , which are relevant to what i want to talk about .
thank you very much . so , 15 minutes left .
and the third boy said , " frank sent this . "
and stop speaking like that . it 's confusing everybody . "
truthfully , what happens is , as children grow up , we start to educate them progressively from the waist up . and then we focus on their heads .
number one , that the most useful subjects for work are at the top . so you were probably steered benignly away from things at school when you were a kid , things you liked , on the grounds that you would never get a job doing that . is that right ?
if you look at the interactions of a human brain , as we heard yesterday from a number of presentations , intelligence is wonderfully interactive .
anyway , she went to see this specialist . so , this oak-paneled room , and she was there with her mother , and she was led and sat on this chair at the end , and she sat on her hands for 20 minutes while this man talked to her mother about all the problems gillian was having at school . and at the end of it -- because she was disturbing people ; her homework was always late ; and so on , little kid of eight -- in the end , the doctor went and sat next to gillian and said , " gillian , i 've listened to all these things that your mother 's told me , and i need to speak to her privately . "
by the way -- we may not see this future , but they will . and our job is to help them make something of it . thank you very much .
and it uses this dexterity to bypass the vagina altogether and deposit sperm directly into the female 's uterus , not to mention it 's a pretty good size .
a group of males will grab a female , hold her down , and ballistically ejaculate their spiral-shaped penis into her corkscrew-shaped vagina over and over and over again .
we 've also seen a titillation strategy where males are actually pleasing their female partners into choosing them as a sex partner .
this species lives only in the congo .
he doesn 't stand quite as upright .
it was a japanese scientist who first undertook serious field studies of the bonobo , almost three decades ago .
i hope i have a lighter .
she switches from reverse to forward and she holds onto the wheel , rather than turns it .
these are the rocks kanzi used and these are the flakes he made .
panbanisha began writing the lexigrams on the forest floor .
then he peers eagerly into his mother 's mouth .
we 're learning how to become like them .
they are a graphical visualization of a character .
so , it 's subject to gravity , has joints , etc .
and this is an example of a successful evolutionary run .
we hired a team of physicists , software engineers and biologists to work on this , and the first thing we had to work on was to create the human body , basically .
what you see is it takes steps backwards , it tries to counter-balance , it tries to look at the place where it thinks it 's going to land .
and this is what happens .
that 's one angle ; here 's another angle .
and this is all a physical simulation of the body , using ai to drive virtual muscles in that body .
i think that 's going to be incredibly exciting .
that 's what we thought was going to come out of this .
then , at the age of eight , we moved to botswana .
everywhere i went , i experienced the wonderful beauty of our continent and saw the resilience and the spirit of our people , and at the time , i realized that i wanted to dedicate the rest of my life to making this continent great .
but if you become the president of zimbabwe , and you say , " you know , i really like this job .
they 've stopped the fighting , and i call them the stabilizer generation .
now , erick realized that agriculture would be the key to creating jobs in the rural areas of madagascar , but he also realized that fertilizer was a very expensive input for most farmers in madagascar .
so today , i 'm announcing for the first time in public an extension to this vision for the african leadership academy .
to watch them move is a dance i 'm never going to get tired of .
everything in the universe wears out . "
a bat 's a penis , and a nappy dugout is a vulva , or a vagina .
that 's just not the way it happens .
you talk about what you like .
and in this case , difference is good , because that 's going to increase the chance that we 're having a satisfying experience .
you do . i do .
these places , these origins , represent governance gaps .
it 's a pharmaceutical product .
so at a national level -- and we work in about 60 different countries -- at a national level we 've got a serious breakdown in the ability of governments to regulate production on their own soil .
they don 't employ those workers .
those supply chains i put up on the screen earlier , they 're not there .
ask yourself , is this company behaving in a socially responsible way ?
there are thousands of suppliers in there . "
we can all make a decision to come together and pick up the balls and run with the balls that governments have dropped .
third one : how do you top that ? what 's next ?
we had less than two hours two-way communication with the outside world in two months .
fast forward three years . i did eventually get off the sofa , and start planning another expedition . this time , i wanted to go right across , on my own this time , from russia , at the top of the map , to the north pole , where the sort of kink in the middle is , and then on to canada .
all i could think about was running back up to the door , banging on the door , and saying , " look guys , i haven 't quite thought this through . "
i knew this was happening . i knew the artic was warming .
i 'd navigate using the direction of the wind .
the entire planet is rotating beneath my feet .
so i thought , i 've got to compose myself for troy .
i mean , it really was starting to break up .
there was a tent , a letter to the norwegian king .
i had never been surrounded by so many azungu , white people .
i felt very happy to be at the secondary school , so i was determined to do anything possible to receive education .
i had never slept in a hotel .
in this case , at trespass points , allowing people to go through because your little tracker device said they were okay , actually cost lives .
when we do this process , we make two types of errors .
and so i think that we evolved ...
that 's a good audience , chris .
so what we 're trying to do is bore into the brain to see where all this happens .
just right , you 're creative , and yet you don 't fall for too much baloney .
because the lights on here .
faces are easy to see because we have an additional evolved facial recognition software in our temporal lobes .
and i call this process agenticity .
explains a lot , maybe .
it ties together all this into the power of expectation and the power of belief .
take a step here .
climate change is a really abstract thing in most of the world .
and one crazy day , i got the idea that i should -- after that assignment was finished -- i got the idea that i should shoot in time-lapse photography , that i should station a camera or two at a glacier and let it shoot every 15 minutes , or every hour or whatever and watch the progression of the landscape over time .
and we 've spent a lot of time in the field . it 's been a fantastic amount of work .
right now , if you look at the top right part of that graph , we 're at 385 parts per million .
this was an aerial picture i did one day in june three years ago .
geologic process in action here .
without the photographic process , you would never see this . this is invisible .
icebergs , many , many , many , many times the size of this building , are roaring out to sea .
i 'm certain that we can .
but only at the very top of this pyramid do these things become completely human .
their names are patrice and patee .
when your children and grandchildren sort of pose questions to you about this period of time , one of the things they 're gonna ask you , is how it was they we allowed some of our closest living relatives , some of the most valuable and endangered species on our planet , to go extinct because we weren 't able to address some of the issues of poverty in these parts of the world .
fortunately , i had and continue to have an absolutely wonderful team of colleagues and collaborators in my own team , and that 's the only way that this work can really occur .
now we have our own liquid nitrogen .
our objective right now , in addition to deploying to these sites and getting everything moving , is to identify new partners because we feel like this effort needs to be extended to probably 20 or more sites throughout the world -- to viral hotspots -- because really the idea here is to cast an incredibly wide net so that we can catch these things , ideally , before they make it to blood banks , sexual networks , airplanes . and that 's really our objective .
that is , promote democracy in difficult places where everything else has already been tried and failed .
the moment you put something critical in a blog , even if you manage to ban it immediately , it will still spread around thousands and thousands of other blogs .
and you may wonder why .
and it 's great simply because they can gather open source intelligence .
because even what has been happening up ' til now with the spinternet and authoritarian deliberation , there is a great chance that those voices will not be heard .
so i was hiding in the shed , like that .
but i thought , perhaps the ant won 't know , it 'll probably move in .
and he says to me " willard , can you put my house on a pinhead ? "
and i had to make them square .
and made the beams going around the house .
ww : so what i did is the same process where i just kind of hold my breath and just work away very , very slowly , manipulating the plastic , cutting it , because it behaves different .
so what i decided to do is to pluck fine hair out of my face .
it 's made -- the chariot is made of gold .
so i says , " ok then , if you say it 's a machine ... "
they go in with their own friction .
willard wigan !
the river system was also home to a giant , car-sized coelacanth , a monster sawfish , flying reptiles .
and some people told me , " wow , this is a once-in-a-lifetime discovery .
but we could keep that idea around the trees .
and also there is no boundary between classrooms .
in summer you go swimming .
and of course , the ceiling height is very low .
the principal says , " i don 't train them . we leave them on top of the roof .
i come from a humble family , and two weeks before the deadline to apply to mit , i started the application process .
maybe if i did little , a couple hundred thousand people would read it , and that 's great already .
you could see that they were sweating and this was tough .
when i was a kid , the disaster we worried about most was a nuclear war .
now , médecins sans frontières did a great job orchestrating volunteers .
and by the time you 're contagious , most people are so sick that they 're bedridden .
the best lessons , i think , on how to get prepared are again , what we do for war .
now i don 't have an exact budget for what this would cost , but i 'm quite sure it 's very modest compared to the potential harm .
kenya is a country where you are guilty until proven rich .
after quitting my job , i decided to organize my friends to speak about the violence in the country , to speak about the state of the nation , and june 1 , 2009 was the day that we were meant to go to the stadium and try and get the president 's attention .
it has been done in uganda and other countries , and what is most powerful is that the images have been picked by the media and amplified across the country , across the continent .
yeah , of course . bm : in spite of being arrested , beaten up , threatened , the moment i discovered my voice , that i could actually stand up for what i really believed in , i 'm no longer afraid .
and if you don 't think that 's going to affect the way in which the world happens in the future , and it doesn 't mean you 're from colorado .
that 's my mom .
at the head of the horsehoe are the really serious pooh-bahs , and down the end of the horseshoe are the not-so-serious pooh-bahs , the junior woodchucks like me .
this guy here ? he 's not american and he 's not greek . he 's chinese .
they were , in fact , given to japan .
i argue simply this : we can do it on the basis on a framework of constructive realism for a common purpose .
and they walked into this cafe quietly , tentatively , gingerly , a little anxious .
you , in a way , are uniquely placed to speak to both sides .
i was lucky , and doubly lucky to be later reunited with my birth parents .
nobody really expected much from people at work or in society because all the expectations then were about home and family responsibilities .
and later , when it was a company valued at over three billion dollars , and i 'd made 70 of the staff into millionaires , they sort of said , " well done , steve ! "
it 's one thing to have an idea for an enterprise , but as many people in this room will know , making it happen is a very difficult thing and it demands extraordinary energy , self-belief and determination , the courage to risk family and home , and a 24 / 7 commitment that borders on the obsessive .
i had the privilege of getting to know some of the most amazing , fierce and courageous human beings i had ever met .
so we open this booth in one of the busiest places in the world and invite people to have this incredibly intimate conversation with another human being .
sl : you were pretty loud , but amy 's was more high-pitched .
nobody comes to storycorps to get rich .
i 'll call you at 11 : 20 in the morning .
oshea israel : just to hear you say those things and to be in my life in the manner in which you are is my motivation .
i 'm going to tell you a secret about storycorps .
remember , storycorps has always been two people and a facilitator helping them record their conversation , which is preserved forever , but at this very moment , we 're releasing a public beta version of the storycorps app .
together , we can create an archive of the wisdom of humanity , and maybe in doing so , we 'll learn to listen a little more and shout a little less .
drones can fly over massive land , but don 't have enough vision technology to help us to track the changes of the rainforests .
but what about this cat ?
once , i even joked to my graduate students that i would just reopen my dry cleaner 's shop to fund imagenet .
so far , we have just taught the computer to see objects .
the real challenge is to go from three to 13 and far beyond .
you see this object here .
one , 3d printing takes forever .
but with our very special window , what we 're able to do is , with oxygen coming through the bottom as light hits it , that oxygen inhibits the reaction , and we form a dead zone .
and so the opportunity now , if you actually make a part that has the properties to be a final part , and you do it in game-changing speeds , you can actually transform manufacturing .
everyone knows that women go a little crazy right before they get their period , that the menstrual cycle throws them onto an inevitable hormonal roller coaster of irrationality and irritability .
overall , the weaknesses in the methods of research on pms have been considerable .
in 2002 , my colleagues and i published an article describing the pms and pmdd research , and several similar articles have appeared in psychology journals .
reputable internet sources of medical information like webmd or the mayo clinic list pms as a known disorder .
second , the pms myth also contributes to the stereotype of women as irrational and overemotional .
i cannot forget them .
when it happens to you , there is no time for thinking , no time for praying .
i would start with the black , play with the white , back to the black trying to trick the other side .
after my kidnapping , i was transferred from north ossetia to chechnya , three days of slow travel in the trunks of different cars , and upon arrival , i was interrogated for 11 days by a guy called ruslan .
ruslan was the most brutal man i ever met .
when you have a tsunami , an earthquake or a typhoon , you see teams of rescuers coming from all over the world , searching for survivors for weeks .
outcomes may depend on various parameters .
humanitarian principles are tested , questioned , and often ignored , but perhaps more importantly , we have abandoned the search for justice .
why them ?
my answer was very simple : if i had quit , that would have meant my kidnapper had won .
it can be incremental , or it can be breakthrough .
so think about it .
for sure , history and certainly hollywood , is full of star-studded teams that have failed .
this is about doing decision making in a way that you can actually combine even opposing ideas to reconfigure them in new combinations to produce a solution that is new and useful .
as the need for a solution became more urgent and as the data , or the evidence , began to come in , it became pretty clear that the big table solution was the right one for the moment .
but if we want to build organizations that can innovate time and again , we must recast our understanding of what leadership is about .
my job is to nurture the bottom-up and not let it degenerate into chaos . "
because what was happening is that everybody was looking up and you weren 't seeing the kind of bottom-up innovation we saw at pixar or google .
i know firsthand .
so he punched me in my chest .
some c.o.s feel that they 're jailing with you .
that 's nicknamed " gladiator school , " because you have a young individual coming in from the street thinking that they 're tough , being surrounded by a bunch of other young individuals from all of the five boroughs , and everybody feels that they 're tough .
i 'm like , " so what are you looking up at the sky for , man ?
this is us . we are one .
or two : you give 100,000 dollars to one savvy entrepreneur and help her set up a factory that yields 40 percent additional income to all 500 banana farmers and creates 50 additional jobs .
we need to build big businesses , and we need jobs .
around 50 percent of the homicides in the streets in brazil are related to the war on drugs .
it may seem obvious , but a key ingredient to civil society diplomacy is first changing and then controlling the narrative .
they inundated our campaign with their propaganda , that as you know , links the right to own guns to ideas of freedom and democracy .
but even worse , it also generated massive negative unintended consequences .
we also assembled the professional classes -- doctors , lawyers , academia and more .
it tells where we have been , who we have met , and in many ways , even what we 're thinking about .
but not only that , any government could lawfully ask for and get the key to your data , and this is all without you being aware of it .
at that time , we were working at the european organization for nuclear research at the world 's largest particle collider , which collides protons , by the way .
i think with protonmail , we have gotten pretty close to doing this .
the good news i can share with you guys today , the exciting news , is that we 're not traveling alone .
they spend most of their time rehabilitating gibbons , but they also have to spend a lot of their time protecting their area from illegal logging that takes place on the side .
and yet here we are today , about half of the rainforest remains , and we have potentially more urgent problems like climate change .
so this is me putting it all together in my parents ' garage , actually .
they were , in fact , great guys .
but that 's not always the case .
a final example from across the world in east africa : there 's been a huge movement to digitize land ownership rights , for a number of reasons .
freely name any card in the deck .
not only that , but i will impose myself a time limit of one second , something that would look like this .
audience member 2 : the black card .
because if not , we could start all over again .
we are defined by the secrets we keep and by the secrets we share .
first of all , i want to ensure that we have a marker and we have a paper clip .
you can shuffle cards in the american way .
and the secret of this dollar bill is the serial number .
the queen of clubs !
once he stepped onto the floor and out of the bed , the pressure sensor would detect an increase in pressure caused by body weight and then wirelessly send an audible alert to the caregiver 's smartphone .
next , i had to design a wearable wireless circuit , but wireless signal transmission consumes lots of power and requires heavy , bulky batteries .
you have six months or a year to live . "
this is a complicated company with thousands of employees , hundreds of millions of dollars of business that makes rocket fuel propellent systems , runs 4,000 atms in brazil , does income tax preparation for dozens of thousands .
so , come have your interviews .
and more , even when we had thousands of people , 5,000 people , we had two people in the h.r. department , and thankfully one of them has retired .
where do we start ?
we have approximately 10 great threads that go from 2 to 17 .
and the kids are in groups that don 't have an age category , so the six-year-old kid who is ready for that with an 11-year-old , that eliminates all of the gangs and the groups and this stuff that we have in the schools , in general .
and i was walking around . it was my birthday and i was thinking .
and with this rationale , i look at these days and i think , i 'm not retired . i don 't feel retired at all .
to many people , this seems crazy .
how do we help you move these ideas forward ?
so when you spend time in a company , in a bureaucracy , in an organization and you 're saying , boy -- how many people do you know who on their death beds said , boy , i wish i had spent more time at the office ?
not so much different from us , they can use plants to treat their intestinal parasites .
they 're toxic to most animals , but not to monarchs .
and what we find when we do that is always the same .
they draw a loaf of bread , which is sliced , then put into a toaster .
what 's interesting about these systems models is how they reveal our various points of view .
the drawings are much richer .
and the practice is really pretty simple .
but today , i can stand here and i can talk to you about beating ebola because of people whom you 've never heard of , people like peter clement , a liberian doctor who 's working in lofa county , a place that many of you have never heard of , probably , in liberia .
you have to trust these people in these space suits to do that for you .
it had already outstripped what was one of the largest responses that had been mounted so far to an ebola outbreak .
and what we saw then was something also we hadn 't seen before .
but despite the fact that we 've not known this disease for a particularly long time , and we don 't know everything about it , we do know how to stop this disease .
i saw presidents opening emergency operation centers themselves against ebola so that they could personally coordinate and oversee and champion this surge of international support to try and stop this disease .
the people of these countries , the leaders of these countries , they are not complacent .
but the people in turkey had already gotten used to the power of twitter because of an unfortunate incident about a year before when military jets had bombed and killed 34 kurdish smugglers near the border region , and turkish media completely censored this news .
and more recently , movement after movement has shaken country after country : the arab uprisings from bahrain to tunisia to egypt and more ; indignados in spain , italy , greece ; the gezi park protests ; taiwan ; euromaidan in ukraine ; hong kong .
it started with a single email about two months after that first email , there were in the united states 600 ongoing occupations and protests .
i found that the gezi protesters were despairing .
well , he said , his party starts getting ready for the next election the day after the last one , and he spends all day every day meeting with voters in their homes , in their wedding parties , circumcision ceremonies , and then he meets with his colleagues to compare notes .
from gezi to tahrir to elsewhere , i 've seen people put their lives and livelihoods on the line .
did anybody watch " blood diamond " ?
australia said , we will take you in .
we never talked about this again .
so fine , it 's all good .
but when i looked at type ii , it all came back to me .
your grandmother did it to me , and i did it to you .
i was like , these people and their damned clitoris .
i was an african australian girl .
one was covering one of my ovaries .
it affects every area of your life , and this happened to me because i was born a girl in the wrong place .
it 's not an african problem . it 's not a middle eastern problem .
and type in khadija , my name , and it 'll come up , and sign it .
it 's nothing but using sensors to read the electrical brainstorms that a brain is producing to generate the motor commands that have to be downloaded to the spinal cord , so we projected sensors that can read hundreds and now thousands of these brain cells simultaneously , and extract from these electrical signals the motor planning that the brain is generating to actually make us move into space .
let 's create a robotic vest .
after nine years without being able to move , he is walking by himself .
but what you see here is the first rat getting informed by a light that is going to show up on the left of the cage that he has to press the left cage to basically get a reward .
miguel nicolelis : no , it 's a little different .
so the first subject got a message , like our rats , a visual message , and transmitted it to the second subject .
it shows a cockroach moving over incredibly rough terrain without tipping over , and it 's able to do this because its legs are a combination of rigid materials , which is what we traditionally use to make robots , and soft materials .
so this is about a centimeter cubed , a centimeter on a side , so very tiny , and we 've gotten this to run about 10 body lengths per second , so 10 centimeters per second .
or they could operate without having to cut you open in the first place .
but when it comes to cities , the conversation is dominated by the north , that is , north america , western europe , australia and japan , where violence is actually at historic lows .
the rest , almost 500,000 people , are dying outside of conflict zones .
these cities are now 40 times larger than they were in the 1950s .
that 's one factor among many , but youthfulness combined with unemployment , lack of education , and -- this is the kicker -- being male , is a deadly proposition .
we have to manage the issues of the public safety against rights to individual privacy .
we also got to focus on those hot people .

that was a bit more inspiring .
and if anybody ever says to you , " i am cold " -- -- if they look like this , they are cold , definitely .
i have been inspired ever since i could walk to recycle by my mum .
we 've got to go back one last time , and at the end of next year , we will go back to the south geographic pole , where we arrived 30 years ago on foot , and retrace our steps of 1,600 kilometers , but this time only using renewable energy to survive .
thank you very much .
jugaad solutions are not sophisticated or perfect , but they create more value at lower cost .
frugal innovation is diametrically opposed to the way we innovate in the north .
danone was so inspired by this model that combines economic efficiency and social sustainability , they are planning to roll it out in other parts of the world as well .
and in france , there is a startup calle compte nickel , which is revolutionizing the banking sector .
i gave tons of examples of frugal innovators from around the world , but the question is , how do you go about adopting frugal innovation ?
the forest is very important for climate regulation .
that 's the good news .
and also we work a lot on land tenure issues .
between climate change and forests .
it 's more or less what one small car , running 20 kilometers a day , will emit in one year .
second , we have to move the incentives to the right place .
that change is incredibly subtle , which is why , when you look at other people , when you look at the person sitting next to you , you don 't see their skin or their face changing color .
and as new parents , we all want to make sure our babies are healthy , that they 're breathing , that they 're alive , of course .
and i 'd like to show you just a couple of examples of what others have done with it .
those are motions that are not visible to us but are visible to a camera with the right processing .
i call it the visual microphone .
we 've only just begun exploring other possible uses for this new technology .
now there is another one .
now , sometimes people use this kind of rules-based grammar to discourage people from making up words .
so these are blend words , like " brunch " is a blend of " breakfast " and " lunch . "
so national aeronautics and space administration becomes nasa .
but if you get the grade " not yet " you understand that you 're on a learning curve .
they don 't engage with it .
creates kids who are hardy and resilient .
so the native kids outdid the microsoft kids .
kaggle puts up competitions to try and get them to solve previously unsolved problems , and it 's been successful hundreds of times .
now the key thing there is , and produce a text-to-speech system that takes chinese text and converts it into chinese language , and we 've used that to modulate again , the result 's not perfect .
this is also happening in china .
and , of course , we 've shown that they can understand what they hear .
we can now segment neurons about as accurately as humans can , but this system was developed with deep learning using people with no previous background in medicine .
you can see , it 's now started to fade some of these pictures out , sometimes , of course , even at this point it 's still difficult to separate out groups .
these are services .
the better computers get at intellectual activities , so this is going to be a kind of change that the world has actually never experienced before , so your previous understanding of what 's possible is different .
it could have been trayvon martin .
and i 'm like , " really ?
i 'm going to tell you what we have learned .
in fact , what they 're suggesting is , stare at awesome black people .
i don 't know why exactly i think that , but that 's what i think .
because , you know what ? just look around your periphery .
many of us , anyways , will be in holidays , and you 've got to listen to the conversations around the table .
they are doting grandpas , caring sons .
the government has hundreds of photos like this about mike going about his daily life .
fortunately , there are steps we can take .
we have to go back to 2009 , when one of my colleagues got a great idea .
the last downhill stretch before we reach our destination .
so when we sat in our editing room , we saw this journalist .
they made all the stories .
he 's doing fine . everything went well .
it 's 14 hours of birdwatching on a tv screen , actually 87 days on the web .
you don 't plan what 's going to happen .
the protesters who occupied maidan , as the square is known , prepared for battle , stockpiling homemade weapons and mass-producing improvised body armor .
there were lines of bodies laid in the street .
when i made these pictures , i believed that i was documenting the end of violent events in ukraine .
so it 's not good . it 's not really good .
we talked about -- they told us why they had joined the guerrillas , why the left the guerrillas , what their dreams were , what their frustrations were , and from those conversations came the underlying insight that has guided this whole campaign , which is that guerrillas are as much prisoners of their organizations as the people they hold hostage .
the problem is that it was working in the lower ranks of the guerrilla .
so rivers are the highways of the jungle , and this is something we learned , and most of the recruiting was being done in and around the river villages .
and then we decided to work with society .
as a matter of fact , 1964 was the year with the highest birth rate ever in germany : more than 1.3 million .
so germany will run into a major talent shortage very quickly .
now , the short answer would be that our numbers already include a significant growth in productivity driven by technology .
so what does this mean ?
the top four topics are all around culture .
employees are resources , are assets , not costs , not head counts , not machines , not even the germans .
[ " disruption of political meeting " ] for those who lie , saying they are back with [ the party ] , your time is running out .
i need them to hear what i heard , i need them to see what i saw , but i also understood , we need the palestinians themselves , the people that are suffering , to be able to tell their own stories , not journalists or filmmakers that are coming outside of the situation .
he is okay .
this is why we decided to take the operation undercover when necessary , and use mostly hidden cameras .
we work with them both to understand the situation on the ground and which images are missing to describe it , who are the ones that are influencing the situation , and when to release the material to advance the struggle .
i used to carry a big gun .
and by going nowhere , i mean nothing more intimidating than taking a few minutes out of every day or a few days out of every season , or even , as some people do , a few years out of a life in order to sit still long enough to find out what moves you most , to recall where your truest happiness lies and to remember that sometimes making a living and making a life point in opposite directions .
we have more and more time-saving devices , but sometimes , it seems , less and less time .
but as soon as i get to a place of real quiet , i realize that it 's only by going there that i 'll have anything fresh or creative or joyful to share with my wife or bosses or friends .
some people i know , just before they go to sleep , instead of scrolling through their messages or checking out youtube , just turn out the lights and listen to some music , and notice that they sleep much better and wake up much refreshed .
okay . what did you see ?
we presented many photographs of obama one at a time , so people did not realize that what we were changing from one photograph to the next was whether we had artificially lightened or darkened his skin tone .
some people may literally see exercise as more difficult , and some people might literally see exercise as easier .
they had a strong goal to make it to the finish line .
when we had them estimate the distance , was this strategy successful for changing their perceptual experience ?
if you 're not convinced yet that we all see the world through our own mind 's eye , let me leave you with one final example .
people tend to diagnose autism with really specific check-box descriptions , but in reality , it 's a whole variation as to what we 're like .
there 's the real world , the world that we all share , and there 's the world in my mind , and the world in my mind is often so much more real than the real world .
what does it mean ?
now , this problem is not only a huge problem for the military , but it 's also a huge problem that 's epidemic throughout the entire medical field , which is how do we actually look at wounds and how do we stop them quickly in a way that can work with the body ?
so if you have a bleeding wound like the one behind me , you can actually put our material onto this , and just like lego blocks , it 'll reassemble into the local tissue .
we were officially empty nesters , and we decided , let 's go on a family vacation .
als ?
six months after diagnosis , pete was given an award at a research summit for advocacy .
so for the next two years , we just watched my son be taken away from me , little by little every day .
by about day four , uncle dave , the webmaster , he isn 't on facebook , and i get a text from him , and it says , " nancy , what the hell is going on ? "
angela merkel , the chancellor of germany .
because the night pete was diagnosed , he told us that he was going to get als in front of philanthropists like bill gates , and he did it .
he walks the face of the earth right now and knows why he 's here .
from grizzly bear in the shower to sigur ros playing in a parisian cafe .
to do all those films , it would have been impossible with a big company behind me , with a structure or anything .
they 're going to think about it differently .
it 's research on the new spiritualities all around the country .
it 's correct ?

for her to tell me that something was the matter , i knew something had to be really wrong .
he even said , " what if they see mistakes and sue us ? "
so my two medical students , suhavi tucker and laura johns , literally took their research to the streets .
incentives matter .
dr. wen needs to move back to her own country . "
my parents and i trusted her because we knew who she was and what she stood for , and she had no need to hide from us .
we can get there , because we 've been there before , and we know that transparency gets us to that trust .
thank you .
i think it all started growing up in a fairly religious , moral family , eldest son of a rabbi , going off to university where i smoked some marijuana and i liked it . and i liked drinking too , but it was obvious that alcohol was really the more dangerous of the two , but my friends and i could get busted for smoking a joint .
but when hundreds of thousands of chinese started showing up in my country , working hard on the railroads and the mines and then kicking back in the evening just like they had in the old country with a few puffs on that opium pipe , that 's when you saw the first drug prohibition laws in california and nevada , driven by racist fears of chinese transforming white women into opium-addicted sex slaves .
will more people use marijuana ?
and ultimately , i think that boils down to the kids , and to every parent 's desire to put our baby in a bubble , and the fear that somehow drugs will pierce that bubble and put our young ones at risk .
so everybody 's understanding , the drug war 's not protecting anybody .
the u.s. economy was plummeting into the great depression and policy makers were struggling to respond .
it ignores the environment .
it 's a whole new way of looking at the world .
the country with the least social progress , i 'm sorry to say , is chad .
it 's got a level of social progress the same as some western european countries , with a much lower gdp .
it 's less than half a plan , because where does brazil want to go on social progress ?
imagine if we could hold politicians to account for really improving people 's lives .
now , what did that lead us to ?
the game is really one of coevolution , and coevolution is , in this particular picture , between cheetahs and gazelles .
now , there 's a lot that can be done on the supply side as well .
thousands of patients are dying because the second-line drugs are so expensive , and in some instances , even those don 't work and you have xdr tb .
now , we learned that favelas are informal communities .
so we quickly went ahead and we painted the boy , and then we thought we were finished , we were really happy , but still , it wasn 't good because the little kids started coming up to us , and they said , " you know , there 's a boy flying the kite , but where is his kite ? "
so we immediately said yes .
this article about angelo appeared .
they will come anyhow , but they will live in slums , favelas and informal settlements .
this is our last project in chile .
it 's not about technology .
where should i take them ? to the forest ?
so we thought that we had to produce a third alternative , and our approach was against geographical threats , have geographical answers .
when it comes to engagement , the data is very clear .
it sits somewhere in between the hdi of algeria and gabon .

i would argue that there has been a fundamental shift in the balance of power in the world .
and you see a whole set of characteristics that you can trace , whether it 's in media or politics or education .
and so , that experience tends to embolden you it tends to make you want more participation across more aspects of your life .
and it does not value , as a company , transparency .
what about if you 're new power ?
they 've raised more than a billion dollars in the capital markets .
when they arrived , they would all take off their skins .
it 's a tethered , flying camera .
and these guys are great . they 're professionals ; they 're really careful in what they do .
and the neat thing about it is , to fly it , there 's no joysticks , nothing like this .
now , i can tell you that it 's easy a lot , but i think a really good way to prove that is to grab a second one and launch it .
and if you watched afghanistan on the news , you may have this view that it 's a failed state .
several people heard about this story , and so they contacted me because they wanted to pay the $ 2,500 debt .
law as a point of leverage is crucial in protecting all of us .

quite literally right there i am skyping in the classroom with one of the six continents and some of the 70,000 students that we connected every single day to some of these experiences .
we are not passive consumers of data and technology .
my son isaac , when he was two , was diagnosed with autism , and he was this happy , hilarious , loving , affectionate little guy , but the metrics on his developmental evaluations , which looked at things like the number of words — at that point , none — communicative gestures and minimal eye contact , put his developmental level at that of a nine-month-old baby .
why ?
three years ago , when i found out that my father had suffered a severe stroke in his brain stem , i walked into his room in the icu at the montreal neurological institute and found him lying deathly still , tethered to a breathing machine .
as a rabbi and spiritual man dangling between mind and body , life and death , the paralysis opened up a new awareness for him .
at first , i thought it was my own hallucination , having spent so much time tending to this one body , so desperate to see anything react on its own .
we never stagnate .
who killed your son ?
and that day , they joined the biggest population of refugees in the world , in a country , lebanon , that is tiny .
communities will need teachers and lawyers and politicians interested in reconciliation and not revenge .
americans and europeans have the impression that proportionally that 86 percent , the vast majority of refugees , are living in the developing world , in countries struggling with their own insecurity , with their own issues of helping their own populations and poverty .
and i also thought , what a waste .
hany 's story is a tragedy , but it doesn 't have to end that way .
it is said today that biotech is advancing at least six times faster than the growth rate of the processing power of computers .
a smartphone is a connected computer and it 's also a camera , good enough for our purpose .
it is too expensive for our families .
so the circulatory system solves the nutrient delivery problem by sending blood vessels to supply nutrients and oxygen to every corner of our body .
the csf fills the space that surrounds the brain , and wastes from inside the brain make their way out to the csf , which gets dumped , along with the waste , into the blood .
so it 's actually a little bit like how you or i , we put off our household chores during the work week when we don 't have time to get to it , and then we play catch up on all the cleaning that we have to do when the weekend rolls around .
bad people are those who plot terrorist attacks or who engage in violent criminality and therefore have reasons to want to hide what they 're doing , but by contrast , good people or to plan their kids ' little league games , and those people are doing nothing wrong and therefore have nothing to hide and no reason to fear the government monitoring them .
the range of behavioral options that we consider when we think we 're being watched severely reduce .
even if you 're somebody who decides that you never want to , the fact that there are other people who are willing to and able to resist and be adversarial to those in power — dissidents and journalists and activists and a whole range of others — is something that brings us all collective good that we should want to preserve .

conflict is bound to happen between a system and citizens that are increasingly used to representing themselves .
marshall mcluhan once said that politics is solving today 's problems with yesterday 's tools .
because the challenges that we face , they 're not technological , they 're cultural .
and in my heart , it 's most definitely worth trying .
so you can see that one century ago , it was between 45 and 50 percent in europe and a little bit above 40 percent in the u.s. , so there was more inequality in europe .
let me first say that probably the best model to explain why wealth is so much more concentrated than income is a dynamic , dynastic model where individuals have a long horizon and accumulate wealth for all sorts of reasons .
growth was maybe 0.1 , 0.2 , 0.3 percent , but very slow growth of population and output per capita , whereas the rate of return on capital of course was not zero percent .
well , we are very far from this , and from now , what 's going on in the real estate sector , the energy sector , is much more important for the total capital stock and capital share .
how likely do you think that it is that they will be implemented ?
having a decent share of the national wealth for the middle class is not bad for growth .
i also drove along the streets of amsterdam , again playing music by this same composer .
very effectively .
the striking thing about it is that only face recognition is impaired ; everything else is just fine .
so i was the first subject .
brain imaging can never tell you if a region is necessary for anything .
that was a trip .
okay . next to the pitch region is another set of regions that are selectively responsive when you hear the sounds of speech .
and his region responded the same to both sets of images .
third , how does all of this very systematic structure get built , both over development in childhood and over the evolution of our species ?
new doctors were needed to make care sustainable , but where would they come from ?
elam 's faculty had no handy evidence base to guide them , so they learned the hard way , by doing and correcting course as they went .
the subjects are familiar — basic and clinical sciences — but there are major differences .
overwhelming .
elam 's graduates , some from right here in d.c. and baltimore , have come from the poorest of the poor to offer health , education and a voice to their communities .
so what tonya doesn 't realize is that there 's a missing 33 percent of the career success equation for women , and it 's understanding what this missing 33 percent is that 's required to close the gender gap at the top .
so i asked , " well , what about people who understand your business , where it 's going , and their role in taking it there ?
so what 's women 's experience as it relates to mentoring ?
so let me close with the latest chapter in tonya 's story .
so the united nations estimates that every year , there are 1.5 million child deaths because of inadequate sanitation .
because essentially , what you 're doing is you 're using clean water and you 're using it to flush your toilet , convey it to a wastewater treatment plant which then discharges to a river , and that river , again , is a drinking water source .
and our idea is to make this a professionalized pit-emptying service so that we can create a small business out of it , create profits and jobs , and the hope is that , as we are rethinking sanitation , we are extending the life of these pits so that we don 't have to resort to quick solutions that don 't really make sense .
shenzhen didn 't even exist as a city .
and most important , permeable , open .
the " no " sign was pretty clear .
i became a witness with a choice : to run away or stand still .
it allows us to see better .
in this respect , the data has gone from a stock to a flow , from something that is stationary and static to something that is fluid and dynamic .
and then what we will have datafied is driver fatigue , and the service would be when the car senses that the person slumps into that position , automatically knows , hey , set an internal alarm that would vibrate the steering wheel , honk inside to say , " hey , wake up , pay more attention to the road . "
and then arthur samuel leaves the computer to play itself .
that makes sense , but the problem , of course , is that it 's not simply going to stop on location data , it 's going to go down to the level of the individual .
we are just at the outset of the big data era , and honestly , we are not very good at handling all the data that we can now collect .
how did this come about ?
this is profound structural change .
surely we recognize that in many of our cities around the world . now , with cities , like life but particularly cities , you have to think ahead .
you can see that the two transformations i 've described , the structural and the climate , come very much together .
forests are the hosts to valuable they hold water in the soil and they take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere , fundamental to the tackling of climate change .
but , and it 's a big but , is moving far too slowly .
i can 't move my body to the beat , and after a scientist who became a philosopher , i have to talk about hard science .
there 'll be no music in my presentation , i 'm going to talk about physiology — not about lungs , but other analogies with human physiology , especially the heart .
there are 600 billion trees in the amazon forest , 600 billion geysers .
if you look at the world map — it 's easy to see this — you 'll see that there are forests in the equatorial zone , and deserts are organized at 30 degrees north latitude , 30 degrees south latitude , aligned .
that 's why we also talk about the heart .
you can rest assured that you are breathing the purest air on earth , here in the amazon , because the plants take care of this characteristic as well .
it 's a mighty river that irrigates south america , among other things .
once , about four years ago , i attended a declamation , of a text by davi kopenawa , a wise representative of the yanomami people , and it went more or less like this : " doesn 't the white man know that , if he destroys the forest , there will be no more rain ?
the universe is wonderful , but we have a practical reality , which is we live in an unknown cosmos , and we 're ignorant about it .
but go and look at what is in there .
this function of the morpho butterfly — it is not blue ; it does not have blue pigments .
but the thing that i want to talk to you about today , the big idea that i want to discuss with you , is not that 3d printing is going to catapult us into the future , but rather that it 's actually going to connect us with our heritage , and it 's going to usher in a new era of localized , distributed manufacturing that is actually based on digital fabrication .
millions of people are served today from these devices .
that will take new tools .
so what is the next window into our universe ?
this swarm of objects you see streaming across the sky are asteroids as they orbit our sun , and it 's these changes and the motion and it 's the dynamics of the system that allow us to build our models for our universe , to predict its future and to explain its past .
so what does this tell us ?
three years to find 42 supernovae by searching through tens of thousands of galaxies .
this will increase by 1,000 within the first four months : 1.5 million supernovae by the end of its survey , each supernova a roll of the dice , each supernova testing which theories of dark energy are consistent , and which ones are not .
a , b or c ? please answer .
you were beaten by the chimps .
now , we miss the majority .
still it 's appalling that so many remain in extreme poverty .
ola rosling : yes , i have an idea , but first , i 'm so sorry that you were beaten by the chimps .
and they are exaggerated , and especially things we 're afraid of .
so we get a shorter list with the terrible results , like some few examples from hans , and we have no problem finding these kinds of terrible results .
the other way to think is , most things improve .
that 's a rule of thumb .
so first , let 's look at the change up till today , 2014 .
now , why would someone want to build an underground park , and why in new york city ?
it 's kind of hard to imagine the unbelievably magical feeling that you have when you get in this space .
so what we 're proposing is really something that will add one football field of green space underneath this neighborhood , but more importantly will introduce a really community-driven focus in a rapidly gentrifying area .
but to make afforestation as a mainstream business or an industry , we had to standardize the process of forest-making .

this satellite measures whether there were clouds or not , because think about it : if there are clouds , then you might have some rain , but if there are no clouds , then it 's actually impossible for it to rain .

they were patient with me .
it was easier to detect conflict and intervene before it escalated .
this initiative has led to many projects that have had huge system-wide impact , not just in our system , but in other state systems as well , small experiments making a big difference to science , to the community .
in fact , they needed intensive programming .
our strategy is hundreds of small changes that take place in days or months , not years .
my friends and i , we own a bank .
and if wealth , power , and income continue to concentrate at the very tippy top , our society will change from a capitalist democracy to a neo-feudalist rentier society like 18th-century france .
this 21st-century perspective allows you to clearly see that capitalism does not work by [ efficiently ] allocating existing resources .
henry ford was in a different time .
i know that most people think that the $ 15 minimum wage is this insane , risky economic experiment .
it is the claim made by those who oppose any increase in the minimum wage that if the poor get richer , that will be bad for the economy .

medical doctors , they 're experts on the population , but you are the expert on yourself .
and the thing is that i have a stutter .
it 's clunky , but you can get away with it , because over time i 've developed this loophole method of using speech where right at the last minute you change the thing and you trick your brain .

i and the other designers who work on these kinds of products have had to invent it as we go along , and we are teaching ourselves the emerging best practices of designing at scale , and today i 'd like share some of the things that we 've learned over the years .

when you do the crossword puzzle or when you watch a magic show , you become a solver , and your goal is to try to find the order in the chaos , the chaos of , say , a black-and-white puzzle grid , a mixed-up bag of scrabble tiles , or a shuffled pack of playing cards .
and how about this puzzle invented in 18th-century england : the jigsaw puzzle .

we also found some interesting things about the symbols people use in passwords .
they 'll start with aaaaa and move on to aaaab , and this is going to take a really long time before they get any passwords that people are really likely to actually have .
what we found was that password meters do work .
and these seemed a little bit more memorable , and maybe people would like those a little bit better .
so we found that the passwords created by people affiliated with the school of computer science were actually 1.8 times stronger than those affiliated with the business school .
there 's a lot of love in these passwords .
the actual events are pretty straightforward .
and anytime i would get a letter from my son , it was like a ray of light in the darkest place you can imagine .

the stuff of the other world can 't .
here 's where i stand .

i do not write dictionaries .
now i get to hang out with dictionary editors , and you might be surprised by one of the places where we hang out .
the list by lake superior state university continues a fairly long tradition in english of complaints about new words .
they then have , as the second definition , skim , and next to that , they say " usage problem . "
now here 's what i do to fill out the ballot .
so how does a word get into a dictionary ?

it propelled me to go on and to co-lead a team that discovered the first cancer susceptibility gene , and in the intervening decades since then , there has been literally a seismic shift in our understanding of what goes on , what genetic variations are sitting behind various diseases .
what we 're asking and looking for is , are there a very few set of individuals who are actually walking around with the risk that normally would cause a disease , but something in them , something hidden in them is actually protective and keeping them from exhibiting those symptoms ?
we 've realized that we should do this in a systematic way , so we 've said , let 's take every single childhood inherited disease .
and so we started asking people such as hakon at the children 's hospital in philadelphia .

we signed up because we love this country we represent .
what i didn 't know then , and do know now , is that avoidance and endurance can be the entryway to forging meaning .
forging meaning and building identity does not make what was wrong right .
but the radicalism in their work actually lay in reinserting humanity into a society that was annihilating humanity itself , as , in some senses , russian society is now doing again .
people narrow the world and function in discrete groups without empathy for one another .
meeting john had been the discovery of great happiness and also the elimination of great unhappiness , and sometimes , i was so occupied with the disappearance of all that pain that i forgot about the joy , which was at first the less remarkable part of it to me .
and daddy , if you were little , i 'd be your friend . "
and it goes on , but as soon as i read this poem , i fell for it hard , so hard , i suspected we must have met somewhere before .
that 's how we did it in the pre-ted.com days .
rives : so that 's " close encounters , " and the main character is all worked up because aliens , momentously , have chosen to show themselves to earthlings at four in the morning , which does make that a very solid example .
take a look .
in " measure for measure , " it 's the call time for the executioner .
i got my curator on . i started fact checking , downloading , illegally screen-grabbing .
i received a poignant tweet .
" 7000 " series polish literature .
at the same time , though , we spend about as much money taking the smells off us as putting them back on in perfumes , and perfumes are a multi-billion-dollar business .
what about humans ?
you 're part of the in-group .
they simply don 't secrete those odorless precursors that the bacteria love to use to produce the smells that in an ethnocentric way we always thought of as characteristic of armpits .
so this is a sleeping baby , and under its nose , we 've put a clean glass rod .
there 's lots to find .
during the savings and loan debacle in 1984 , we looked at every single failure , and we looked for common characteristics , and we discovered this recipe was common to each of these frauds .
and our examiners said , they are making loans without even checking what the borrower 's income is .
what happened in the governmental sector ?
flash forward to the current crisis .
these are the so-called too-big-to-fail institutions .
mark applebaum : i 'm going to -- kate stone : -- mix some music .
ryan holladay : blend seamlessly .
that 's the major thread .
i was involved in a heavy love affair with the music of duran duran , as you can probably tell from my outfit .
you have to take an element of those things and then bring something fresh and new to it , which was something that i learned when i was working with the late , amazing amy winehouse on her album " back to black . "
let 's hear that ted sound again , right ?
and i 've tried , i 've met them a few times , tried asking them , and they aren 't revealing anything .
the math is not all that advanced , and really it 's like nothing more than solving a sudoku puzzle .
and on these punch cards , there are a bunch of holes , and i said , thank you , thank you , okay , so what 's on here ?
edi : robot . a word coined in 1921 in a science fiction tale by the czech playwright karel čapek .
when someone hands an object to you , you can read intention in their eyes , their face , their body language .
alan turing , a pioneer of artificial intelligence , spoke about creating the illusion that a machine could think .
my friend harold ford calls me .
i mean , why would anyone treat me differently ?
but still , as i grapple with this issue , my mother 's question hangs in the air for me : how did they treat you ?
we cannot afford to be color blind .
and i 'm telling you , you can be color brave .
and i want them to know that anything is possible , that they ever imagined , that they will be welcome in any corporate boardroom , or they can lead any company .
i don 't know what 's coming , and all i can do is remind myself that i told chris i 'd fly by the seat of my pants , and now that i 'm up here it sort of feels like that dream where you don 't have any pants on , and so i suppose i 'm going to be flying by the seat of my ass .
but i also , i just need to acknowledge that ted is an incredible experience right now in the present , like , i just need to say , like , isabel allende . isabel allende !
i think , sarah jones , maybe she didn 't want me to come out last time .
enjoy the rest of it .
you guys are a-mazing , by the way .
i don 't know what to call myself now , because i have really my chinese identity , but my kids , they are american-chinese , but it 's difficult to try to express myself in front of audience of people like this .
who 's here ?
find it and try to find yourself in there .
okay , well if you think about how you can calculate these things , you can take what you can see , okay , i 'm going to chop it up and that 's the result of physics , right ?
we can look at all of the different equations that go into making the ice grow or melt or change shape .
this is all very good . this is all great .
the eruption of mount pinatubo in 1991 put an enormous amount of aerosols , small particles , into the stratosphere .
the second one are the observations .
thank you .
traditionally , this requires expensive equipment to examine an area called the retina .
so for patients like mama wangari , who have been blind for over 10 years and never seen her grandchildren , for less than 40 dollars , we can restore her eyesight .
in 1936 , jesse owens held the world record in the 100 meters .
biomechanical analysis of the speed of owens ' joints shows that had been running on the same surface as bolt , he wouldn 't have been 14 feet behind , he would have been within one stride .
this first cliff , in 1956 , is the introduction of the flip turn .
there 's some dispersal , but it 's kind of grouped around that average body type .
had leonardo wanted to draw the vitruvian nba player , he would have needed a rectangle and an ellipse , not a circle and a square .
it 's the same reason that a radiator has long coils , to increase surface area compared to volume to let heat out , and because the leg is like a pendulum , the longer and thinner it is at the extremity , the more energy-efficient it is to swing .
and we have big old butt muscles that keep us upright while running .
it 's actually a spectrum of disorders , a spectrum that ranges , for instance , from justin , a 13-year-old boy who 's not verbal , who can 't speak , who communicates by using an ipad to touch pictures to communicate his thoughts and his concerns , a little boy who , when he gets upset , will start rocking , and eventually , when he 's disturbed enough , will bang his head to the point that he can actually cut it open and require stitches .
the institute of medicine , the centers for disease control , have repeatedly investigated this and there is no credible evidence that vaccines cause autism .
remarkably , though , it 's not 100 percent .
our genetic information is organized into a set of 46 volumes , and when we did that , we had to be able to account for each of those 46 volumes , because in some cases with autism , there 's actually a single volume that 's missing .
instead of the eyes focusing in and having that social connection , looking at the mouth , looking at the nose , looking off in another direction , but not again socially connecting , and being able to do this on a very large scale , screen infants , screen children for autism , through something very robust , very reliable , is going to be very helpful to us in terms of being able to intervene at an early stage when we can have the greatest impact .
a computer is an incredibly powerful means of creative expression , but for the most part , that expression is confined to the screens of our laptops and mobile phones .
they 're these special wheels that can move equally easily in all directions , and when you couple these robots with a video projector , you have these physical tools for interacting with digital information .
but when we want to have a video chat or play a game or lay out the slides to our next ted talk , the objects on the table come alive .
on the human side , walter starck , an oceanographer , has been painting his wetsuit since the 1970s , and anthropologically , pacific island tribes painted themselves in bands in a sea snake ceremony to ward off the shark god .
so this is what i call a " don 't eat me " wetsuit .
now that exact same shark had engaged , or encountered this sams rig , which is the elude sams rig , about eight minutes before , and spent six minutes circling it , hunting for it , looking for what it could smell and sense but not see , and this was the final engagement .

it has that spark of life from the human hand that the machine or the program can never capture .
this brought some benefits but also one particular drawback : a spacing system that only provided 18 discrete units for letters to be accommodated on .
remember this reading experience ?
so the sans serif , in the middle , sans the serifs , was much more economical , 81 to 151 .
in other words , i had come to like this typeface .
it was only a stopgap .
for a certain kind of temperament , there is a certain kind of satisfaction in doing something that cannot be perfect but can still be done to the best of your ability .
i want us , in the next decade , to build a space telescope that 'll be able to image an earth about another star and figure out whether it can harbor life .
now we 're at alpha centauri , our nearest neighbor star , and the planet is gone .
it 's like water bending around a rock in a stream , and all that light just destroys the shadow .
last summer , we did a really cool test out in california at northrop grumman .

this wasn 't rocket science .
they were treating young adolescents after giving them the most intense psychometric testing of gender , and they were treating them by blocking the puberty that they didn 't want .
well , where were these kids before ?
and on the far right , there she is .
and then they finally got it .
there are guides to raising an eco-friendly kid , which , if you ask me , is a little bit creepy .
something about parenting right now at this moment is the problem .
today , extracurricular activities are a kid 's new work , but that 's work for us too , because we are the ones driving them to soccer practice .
i pay my taxes .
they work more paid hours , on average , than their wives , and they genuinely want to be good , involved dads .
and happiness is an even more unfair burden to place on a kid .
but it occurs to me now that the hippocratic oath is a much more realistic aim than happiness .
adam ii is the humble side of our nature .
we happen to live in a society that favors adam i , and often neglects adam ii .
you were both doing the work that you love .
i don 't know anybody that 's as tough as my wonderful wife right here .
pm : that seems to be the number one characteristic of gabby giffords , wouldn 't you say ? gabby 's always been really optimistic .
a good friend .
in our case , it was washington , d.c. , houston , tucson .
pm : and yet i 'm trying to imagine , mark , what that was like , going off onto a mission , one presumes safely , but it 's never a guarantee , and knowing that gabby is — well not only was she still in the hospital , on the third day of that flight , literally while i was rendezvousing with the space station , and you 've got two vehicles moving at 17,500 miles an hour , i 'm actually flying it , looking out the window , a bunch of computers , gabby was in brain surgery , literally at that time having the final surgery to replace the piece of skull that they took out on the day she was injured with a prosthetic , yeah , which is the whole side of her head .
it has to be . you 're together all the time now .
we 're gun owners , we support gun rights .
gg : thank you .
the prosthetic socket is the part in which the amputee inserts their residual limb , and which connects to the prosthetic ankle .
and i love to use film to take us on a journey through portals of time and space , to make the invisible visible , because what that does , it expands our horizons , it transforms our perception , and it touches our heart .
we 're giants , and we 're unaware of things that are too small for us to see .
we are on the threshold of extraordinary advances , born of our drive to unveil the mysteries of life .
and that to me is sad .
and when they try to describe what that is , they just say , " he has that magic . "
so even more important than buildings in a city are the public spaces in between them .
this is how plazas have been designed for generations .
instead of building a park as a complement to future development , why don 't we reverse that equation and build a small but very high-quality public open space first , and see if that made a difference .
but we had never before thought of how we could make the most of it .
now the zoning here was massive , so i felt an obligation to create magnificent parks on these waterfronts , and i spent an incredible amount of time on every square inch of these plans .
so what 's the trick ?
and when i was appointed , saving the first two sections of the high line from demolition became my first priority and my most important project .
it 's not just the number of people using them , it 's the even greater number of people who feel better about their city just knowing that they are there .
around the height of the nazi period , he started repeating the verse , " first they came for the communists , and i did nothing , did not speak out because i was not a communist .
i was so proud . i was telling him about my talk , " laws that choke creativity . "
i couldn 't begin to describe the sadness .
and it 's this gap between 96 and 91 that explains our politics of resignation .
indeed yesterday , merriam announced so on may 1 , aka may day , we 're going to try an experiment .
so facebook is not the only place you can do this , but it 's the biggest , and it serves to illustrate the numbers .
and again , it doesn 't come from what you might think of as obvious information .
how do you know that you 've liked something that indicates a trait for you that 's totally irrelevant to the content of what you 've liked ?
so i think the other path that we can go down that 's going to be more effective is one of more science .
we were already engaged to be married .
well , we decided that we 'd pick two causes , whatever the biggest inequity was globally , and countries that were really stuck , because with that level of death , and parents would have so many kids that they 'd get huge population growth , and that the kids were so sick so that was our global thing , and then in the u.s. , both of us have had amazing educations , could live up to its promise of equal opportunity is by having a phenomenal education system , and the more we learned , the more we realized we 're not really fulfilling that promise .
well , my graph has numbers on it .
now that the millennium development goals we are seeing some increased generosity , which should be possible in our lifetime .
but now you are , and we 're very happy that you are .
we 'll take the different trips she described .
fortunately , we found out that if you go kill the sand flies , you probably can have success there , but we spent five years , you could say wasted five years , and about 60 million , very modest benefit when we got there .
and when we 'd go out to chop wood and do all the things that grace and her mother would do , grace was not a child , she was an adolescent , but she wasn 't an adult .
is that your plan for them ?
people give to some things . we look and go , " wow . "
in the u.s. , we 're trying to change the education system so it 's just for everybody and it works for all students .
it 's the same for other companies dealing at this sort of scale .
let 's look at spam .
it 's an issue for anybody who 's building or creating something that you think is going to be amazing and will let people do awesome things .
there 's geodata .
these shrimp are infected with a tapeworm .
they are part of an entire cavalcade of mind-controlling parasites , of fungi , viruses , and worms and insects and more that all specialize in subverting and overriding the wills of their hosts .
we have a lot to get through . i only have 13 minutes . now , some of you are probably just desperately clawing for some solace in the idea that these things are oddities of the natural world , that they are outliers , and that point of view is understandable , because by their nature , parasites are quite small and they spend a lot of their time inside the bodies of other things .
now i would argue that , once stung , the cockroach isn 't a roach anymore .
you 're very charitable , generous people .
and i think that this capacity to constantly subvert our way of thinking about the world makes parasites amazing .
i had no interest in becoming an artist , certainly not a painter .
as we walked to the center of the room , i looked up at the heavens through the oculus .
i mean , to me , the pyramids at giza , we visited those the year before , and sure they 're impressive , nice enough design , but look , give me an unlimited budget , 20,000 to 40,000 laborers , and about 10 to 20 years to cut and drag stone blocks across the countryside , and i 'll build you pyramids too .
so then how do these projects of unprecedented creative vision and technical complexity like the pantheon actually happen ?
so what came after the moon ?
although perhaps not obvious today , autonomous vehicles will be the key technology that enables us to redesign our cities and , by extension , civilization .
occasionally , humans will need to do sense-making .
and several of you have written to me with questions to ask our guest here from the nsa .
if folks aren 't comfortable with that , there are a number of inspectors general .
but it 's also used by people who are working against us and our allies .
it is a global telecommunications system .
and they 're actually using that to counter the very large technological edge that u.s. companies have in areas like the cloud and internet-based technologies .
rl : they do . they do , in the sense of , the only way that we are able to compel one of those companies to provide us information is when it falls into one of three categories : we can identify that this particular person , identified by a selector of some kind , is associated with counterterrorist or proliferation or other foreign intelligence target .
and so you have a lot of those arcs of instability in the world right now , in places like syria , where there 's a civil war going on and you have massive numbers , thousands and thousands of foreign fighters who are coming into syria to learn how to be terrorists and practice that activity , and lots of those people are westerners who hold passports to european countries or in some cases the united states , and so they are basically learning how to do jihad and have expressed intent to go out and do that later on in their home countries .
i mean , first of all , a lot of people who look at risk and look at the numbers don 't understand this belief that terrorism is still the number one threat .
you think about on television , you watch a murder mystery .
and the other one is that the nsa has both of those missions , and we are heavily biased towards defense , and , actually , the vulnerabilities that we find in the overwhelming majority of cases , we disclose to the people who are responsible for manufacturing or developing those products .
but there is a strong tradition in american jurisprudence of having discussions with people who have been charged with crimes in order to , if it benefits the government , to get something out of that , that there 's always room for that kind of discussion .
look at the data .
but why do i have to respect the teachers and authority ?
we secretly filmed some of the family of the former chief minister and a lawyer as they told our undercover investigator exactly how these dubious deals are done using such companies .
and the other , even better , i 'm afraid that 's america .
you can have hundreds of layers with hundreds of companies spread across lots of different countries , like a giant web , each layer adds anonymity .
why should this secrecy be such an accepted business practice ?
it 's going to be a springboard for our global campaigning .
and why did you do it ?
it 's like you 're in the jaws of some enormous dog and there 's a foot in the small of your back pushing you into space , accelerating wildly straight up , shouldering your way through the air , and you 're in a very complex place -- paying attention , watching the vehicle go through each one of its wickets with a steadily increasing smile on your face .
and you 're holding on with one hand , looking at the world turn beside you .
and that spider -- not only that , but that spider has beautiful markings on it , it 's like " i 'm dangerous . i got a big radiation symbol on my back , it 's the black widow . "
so when you finally actually get outside on a spacewalk , it feels much different than it would if you just went out first time .
the only part that survives is the little bullet that we 're riding in , and it falls into the atmosphere , and in essence you are riding a meteorite home , and riding meteorites is scary , and it ought to be .
i 'd like you to imagine this place .
i sat down .
normally , the more empathic a person is , the larger and more active their amygdala is .
for over 100 years , neuroanatomists and later neuroscientists held the view that after initial development in childhood , no new brain cells could grow in the adult human brain .
our research does not suggest that criminals should submit their mri scans as evidence in court and get off the hook because they 've got a faulty amygdala .
finally , i believe we need to change our own amygdalae , because this issue goes to the heart not just of who joe is , but who we are .
and from the wright brothers to steve jobs , hacking has always been at the foundation of american democracy .
it would have taken the three of them a very long time , especially given that none of them are actually from honolulu .
they asked programmers in mexico to build something better and cheaper , and they offered a prize of 9,300 dollars -- 10,000 times cheaper than the government contract , and they gave the entrants 10 days .
could be the neighbors , hotel room , your parents . sorry .
generally we 're talking about meat , shelter , status , protection , things like that .
and i 'm not saying there was no pair-bonding going on .
that indicates female copulatory vocalization .
it doesn 't matter . nobody cares . nobody gossips . it 's not an issue .
so a question .
i think it 's reckless to ignore these things , because doing so can jeopardize future long-term returns .
they started to see sustainability not just as important but crucial to business success .
the data shows that stocks with better esg performance perform just as well as others .
and the sixth largest in the world .
the global bond market , 78 trillion .

generally a duty of care arises when one individual or a group of individuals undertakes an activity which has the potential to cause harm to another , either physically , mentally or economically .
obviously this is not a mandated duty , but for the gifted filmmaker and the responsible journalist or even blogger , it strikes me as being utterly inescapable .
the first led almost immediately to the nuclear test ban treaty , and the second led to the 1964 civil rights act , both of which represented giant leaps forward .
then comes a perturbation : milk .
i wanted to understand complexity , the complexity of the world around us and especially in the animal kingdom .
so how could it be that the bats maintain this complex , stable social structure with such limited cognitive abilities ?
what we do is put very small gps collars on these animals to study how they move together , and what this has to do with their social structure .
in fact , the dominant female is extremely important for the cohesion of the group .
the last year has seen the invention of a new four-letter word .
this is a classroom at the obafemi awolowo university in nigeria .
if i were to teach at mit two semesters every year , i would have to teach for 40 years before i could teach this many students .
i text her , she responds .
we were also doing other pilots .
now , when i went to a lecture hall , and if you were like me , by the fifth minute i would lose the professor .
my colleague ed bertschinger , who heads up the physics department at mit , has this to say about instant feedback : he indicated that instant feedback turns teaching moments into learning outcomes .
boom , boom , boom , boom , the students were discussing and interacting with each other , and by 4 a.m. that night , i 'm totally fascinated , having this epiphany , and by 4 a.m. in the morning , they had discovered the right answer .
i have spent the last years trying to resolve two enigmas : why is productivity so disappointing in all the companies where i work ?
i forgot all the metrics , incentives , committees , middle offices and interfaces .
twenty percent at most , divided by 26 kpis , repairability makes a difference of 0.8 percent .
how do the hard and the soft try to foster cooperation ?
definitely , these approaches are obsolete .
create feedback loops that expose people to the consequences of their actions .
the real battle is not against competitors .
as i found , if you really want to know a people , you start by looking inside their bedrooms .
faiza was living proof of this .
and then there are men and women who cross the heterosexual line , who have sex with their own sex , or who have a different gender identity .
the encyclopedia is just one in a long line of arabic erotica , much of it written by religious scholars .
social change doesn 't happen in the arab region through dramatic confrontation , beating or indeed baring of breasts , but rather through negotiation .
would it open up beneath my bed and swallow me as i slept ?
and so i believed it anyway , even though it didn 't make much sense .
now , the theory behind this bias in the over 400 studies is called terror management theory , and the idea is simple . it 's just this .
that 's the idea that when you die , you can have yourself frozen , and then , at some point when technology has advanced enough , you can be thawed out and repaired and revived and so resurrected .
well the greek philosopher epicurus thought we could .

now the crazy thing about glacier caves is that each year , new tunnels form .
we named this cave snow dragon cave because it was like a big dragon sleeping under the snow .
for example , this is a noble fir seed we found .
africa is a place where people still sit under starlit skies and around campfires and tell stories , and so what i have to share with you today is the simple medicine of a few campfire stories , stories about heroes of heart .
solly grew up tending to his father 's cattle .
the water was clear running over sand , and we turned and we began to make our way upstream .
as i come out of the water , solly arrives at a deep section , a channel between us .
and then i met this young lady .
halfway up the bank , a young teenage elephant came in behind her , and he propped his trunk underneath her , and he began to shovel her up the bank .
anywhere he went , things went well .
the first one is equality of quality of life , especially for children , that all children should have , beyond the obvious health and education , access to green spaces , to sports facilities , to swimming pools , to music lessons .
there is a really enormous conflict , when we are talking about developing country cities , between pedestrians and cars .
and we are living in a unique moment in history .
they could go for dozens of kilometers safely without any risk in wonderful greenways , sort of bicycle highways , and i would invite you to imagine the following : a city in which every other street would be a street only for pedestrians and bicycles .
the cities we are going to build over the next 50 years will determine quality of life and even happiness for billions of people towards the future .
i bring up this example to begin , because it emphasizes how little we know about nature .
now i created the cao in order to answer questions that have proven extremely challenging to answer from any other vantage point , such as from the ground , or from satellite sensors .
we can go to an area of utter devastation caused by deforestation in blue , and the virus of deforestation spreading out in orange .
so what we think , as earth scientists , is species are going to have to migrate with climate change from the east in brazil all the way west into the andes and up into the mountains in order to minimize their exposure to climate change .
this tells us where the big biodiversity changes occur from habitat to habitat , and that 's really important because it tells us a lot about where species may migrate to and migrate from as the climate shifts .
until then , you 're going to find me flying in some remote place that you 've never heard of .
this is really important . you can 't , like , wait while they fight it out and then swoop in at the last minute .
any star wars fans ?
well done . thank you . thank you very much .
and it 's truly awesome and wondrous .
get ready to update your twitter or facebook status .
i am constantly swimming in numbers and formulas and charts .
so online dating is the second most popular way that people now meet each other , but as it turns out , algorithms have been around for thousands of years in almost every culture .
so steve the i.t. guy invited me out to one of philadelphia 's white-table-cloth , extremely expensive restaurants .
see , the real problem here is that , while the algorithms work just fine , you and i don 't , when confronted with blank windows where we 're supposed to input our information online .
i broke it into a top tier and a second tier of points , and i ranked everything starting at 100 and going all the way down to 91 , and listing things like i was looking for somebody who was really smart , who would challenge and stimulate me , and balancing that with a second tier and a second set of points .
at this moment i knew , clicking after profile after profile after profile that looked like this , that i needed to do some market research .
so this is a word cloud highlighting the most popular words that were used by the most popular women , words like " fun " and " girl " and " love . "
they said , " what ? you 're still being too damn picky . "
so i wanted to tell a story that really obsessed me when i was writing my new book , and it 's a story of something that happened 3,000 years ago , when the kingdom of israel was in its infancy .
it was a way of settling disputes without incurring the bloodshed of a major battle .
that 's all he 's carrying .
that 's substantially faster than a baseball thrown by even the finest of baseball pitchers .
so why do we keep calling david an underdog , and why do we keep referring to his victory as improbable ?
there have been many articles written .
come to me because i can 't see you .
just imagine , if you have a computer and a printer and you want to transmit , to input to print out a document , but the printer doesn 't have the right drives , so the same is for mario .
we started physiotherapy , we started the rehabilitation , and one of the paths that we were following in terms of rehabilitation is the mirror neurons pilot .
and this is the message that we want to share with you .
i ended up on a farm in the middle of nowhere .
and i was determined , and i managed to show that i could do that .
and when you touch it , you can hear the music that 's described on the top , which is something you can 't read .
and there 's a couple of other things .
what happened , that is , on the night in the year 610 when muhammad received the first revelation of the koran on a mountain just outside mecca ?
and that panicked disorientation , that sundering of everything familiar , that daunting awareness of something beyond human comprehension , can only be called a terrible awe .
they found the perfect antidote to thought and the ideal refuge of the hard demands of real faith .
in fact , most of us do , whether we 're atheist or theist or anywhere in between or beyond , for that matter , what drives us is that , despite our doubts and even because of our doubts , we reject the nihilism of despair .
so the understanding of this great recession was that this was completely surprising , this came out of the blue , this was like the wrath of the gods .
from the dragon-king concept i propose , which is exactly the opposite , that most extreme events so we can be empowered and take responsibility and make predictions about them .
the biggest one was the " new economy " internet bubble in 2000 , crashing in 2000 , the real estate bubbles in many countries , financial derivative bubbles everywhere , stock market bubbles also everywhere , commodity and all bubbles , debt and credit bubbles -- bubbles , bubbles , bubbles .
the chinese market collapsed , but it rebounded .
but with modern encrypting techniques , we have a hash , we publish a public key , and six months later , we release the report , and there is authentication .
this will not be a speech like any one i have ever given .
so in 1967 , elections were coming , things were going well in the campaign , the house was electric .
negotiations are difficult , the tensions are high , progress is slow , and then , 10 minutes to 2 , a prime minister shouts out , " we have to finish in 10 minutes . "
instead of reaching out to the common or the collective wisdom in our societies , investing in it to find more creative solutions , we reverted to political posturing .
let 's see how we can bring people back to the process .
well , this is exactly where i think europe fits in .
george papandreou : well , obviously there were constraints which didn 't allow me or others to make the types of decisions we would have wanted , and obviously i had hoped that we would have the time to make the reforms which would have dealt with the deficit rather than trying to cut the deficit which was the symptom of the problem .
they are inherently unstable , and they need some form of automatic feedback control in order to be able to fly .
how did we design the algorithms to do this ?
balancing a pole is hard .
this quad has a racket strapped onto its head with a sweet spot roughly the size of an apple , so not too large .
interaction doesn 't have to be virtual . it can be physical .
what impact will the speed of machines have on our way of life ?
well , it 's two things . first , it 's time .
how do you get somebody who is too busy to star in a movie ?
so that 's kind of a big problem too .
but then , you know , eventually you have to turn all these drawings into reality .
they had large tusks , and we seem to have a very deep connection with them , like we do with elephants .
so those bacteria , along with the environmental bacteria , free water and oxygen , actually break apart the dna into smaller and smaller and smaller dna fragments , until all you have are fragments that range from 10 base pairs to , in the best case scenarios , a few hundred base pairs in length .
there 's no climates or habitats suitable .
now obviously , they 're also women 's issues , so i appreciate that , but calling gender violence a women 's issue is part of the problem , for a number of reasons .
it starts with a very basic english sentence : " john beat mary . "
this is victim blaming , and there are numerous reasons for it , but one of them is that our whole cognitive structure is set up to blame victims . this is all unconscious .
that 's a naive way to understanding what is a much deeper and more systematic social problem .
now , i appreciate that that 's a problem . it 's sexism .
but instead of seeing it in the binary fashion , we focus on all of us as what we call bystanders , and a bystander is defined as anybody who is not a perpetrator or a victim in a given situation , so in other words friends , teammates , colleagues , coworkers , family members , those of us who are not directly involved in a dyad of abuse , but we are embedded in social , family , work , school , and other peer culture relationships with people who might be in that situation . what do we do ?
in the end , what will hurt the most is not the words of our enemies but the silence of our friends .
you know , for example , i work a lot in college and university athletics throughout north america .
we also owe it to young men who are growing up all over the world in situations where they didn 't make the choice to be a man in a culture that tells them that manhood is a certain way .
the reason why we forgot that is because the times in history when architecture did the most to transform society were those times when , actually , the one percent would build on behalf of the 99 percent , for various different reasons , whether that was through philanthropy in the 19th century , communism in the early 20th , the welfare state , and most recently , of course , through this inflated real estate bubble .
and the problem is that , like a lot of design professions , we got fixated on the idea of providing a particular kind of consumer product , and i don 't think that needs to be the case anymore .
or the same idea here , which is for a cnc machine , which is like a large printer that can cut sheets of plywood .
with the cnc machine , you can make new parts for it over its life or even use it to make the house next door .
they 're self-made cities in one form or another .
and so , about 20 years later , i didn 't realize the full effect of this , but i went to costa rica and i stayed with these guaymí natives there , and they could pull leaves off of trees and make shingles out of them , and they could make beds out of trees , and they could -- i watched this woman for three days .
so his hands know and his intuition knows , but sometimes what we know gets in the way of what could be , especially when it comes to the human-made , human-built world .
a pencil is not just a pencil .
and so i just want to do a quick demo .
get a bowl of water . this is just photo booth on your mac os .
like this dad who wrote us , his son has cerebral palsy and he can 't use a normal keyboard .
it doesn 't have air conditioning .
that last downward notch in the red line is not actual data .
it 's a truism that your standard of living rises faster than productivity , rises faster than output per hour , if hours per person increased .
so let 's see what some of those inventions were .
in america , before the motor vehicle , transportation depended entirely on the urban horse , which dropped , without restraint , 25 to 50 pounds of manure on the streets every day together with a gallon of urine .
by 1960 we had telephone bills , bank statements were being produced by computers .
it 's been around for about 7,000 years .
so what i 'm going to tell you about is using the circuitry of the brain to implant electrodes and turning areas of the brain up and down to see if we can help our patients .
and we do that with electricity .
this boy is now in university and leads quite a normal life .
i 've shown you that we can use it to treat a mood circuit in cases of depression .
and indeed , at the top , you 'll see before the surgery , the areas in blue are the areas that use less glucose than normal , predominantly the parietal and temporal lobes .
thank you very much .
em : sure . so , in order to accelerate the advent of electric transport , and i should say that i think , actually , all modes of transport will become fully electric with the ironic exception of rockets .
i mean , this is a beautiful but expensive car .
wait for an hour , but the good news is , you 're helping save the planet , and by the way , the electricity is free . you don 't pay anything .
most people choose to lease .
but you yourself get a long-term commercial benefit from that power .
and so i tell people , well , i was trying to figure out the fastest way to turn a large fortune into a small one .
but the big innovation is still ahead , and you 're working on it now . tell us about this .
so progress on this " let 's make it reusable , " how is that going ? that was just a simulation video we saw .
is that -- could we have some of that secret sauce ?
thank you so much .
so , what 's great about this is it isn 't just a faster , more convenient way to get information in the real world , but there are times when actually using this medium allows you to be able to display information in a way that was never before possible .
move away from it and come back to it .
oh , there we are . we can save it now .
so when we 're talking about authenticity , it 's a little more fractal than it appears and that 's a good example to show it .
they know the name , from the name they can find the address , and then they can go off and buy stuff online .
so i want to know who all the people in the chatroom are .
it 's an outrageous imposition on my 4th amendment right to privacy , and you 're going to be sued for all the money you 've got . "
if i don 't want to inflame the protestors , the obvious thing to do is go dressed as a protestor .
it 's just like the nurse in the hospital reporting the drunk surgeon .
you 're not nerds if you say yes .
it has to be a utility that you can use everywhere .
the technology already exists .
so — click ! — you put it into your shopping cart .
in this particular instance we were trying to assemble 30 items of inventory into a few totes , onto a van to deliver to the home .
and say , labor is cheap , land is cheap .
and they made some fabulous art .
and they feel a little bit more in control of their environment .
in this example you see that the inventory has now occupied all the perimeter of the building because that 's where the pick stations were .
and now i think next time you go to your front step and pick up that box that you just ordered online , you break it open and the goo is in there , you 'll have some wonderment as to whether a robot assisted in the picking and packing of that order .
and of course , the popular fascination with this is enormous .
we have sensations and experiences as well .
now those parts are also physical parts , of course , brains , bodies and legs and things , but they aren 't so important , actually .
why think of ourselves as somehow not just being a collection of all our parts , but somehow being a separate , permanent entity which has those parts ?
but i don 't think this is a very helpful way of looking at it .
because unlike the the waterfalls , we actually have the capacity to channel the direction of our development for ourselves to a certain degree .
but before i do that , we have to go over the definition of what green is , ' cause a lot of us have a different definition of it .
because crops are already growing on that land that 's very scarce around the world .
we use open pond systems . now , around the world they are growing algae , with this racetrack design that you see here . looks like an oval with a paddle wheel and mixes really well , but when it gets around the last turn , which i call turn four — it 's stagnant .
we have a natural solution : fish .
this is a 100 percent usable plant . the seeds : biofuels . the rest : cattle feed .
so , water , fuel and food .
so , greenlab research facility .
they weren 't sued because there was carcinogens in the chicken , but they were sued because of california 's proposition 65 , which stated that if there 's anything dangerous in the products then the companies had to give a clear warning .
another important factor that i didn 't take into account initially was the time cooked .
and i remember watching my family go through that and thinking that i never wanted another family to feel that kind of loss .
so that 's what we set out to do .
1.6 million deaths worldwide .
and all of julie 's data has been pre-entered into my interactive software model .
so i 'm very passionate about this research and i really want to continue it and expand it to more disorders besides asthma , more respiratory disorders , as well as more pollutants .
with this job all i needed were my hands and my massage table by my side and i could go anywhere .
and if i snowboarded again , my feet aren 't going to get cold .
and just this past february , i won two back-to-back world cup gold medals — — which made me the highest ranked adaptive female snowboarder in the world .
i 'm colorblind .
being a diplomat , then and now , is an incredible job , and i loved every minute of it -- i enjoyed the status of it .
i negotiated for my country the resolution in the security council of the 12th of september 2001 condemning the attacks of the day before , which were , of course , deeply present to us actually living in new york at the time .
and indeed , our own internal assessment was very clear that iraq 's wmd did not pose a threat to its neighbors , let alone to us .
a second thing happened in kosovo , which kind of delivered the answer , which i couldn 't really answer , which is , " what do i do with my life ? "
and funnily enough , they were frustrated about that .
independent diplomat is now established in five diplomatic centers around the world , and we 're advising seven or eight different countries , or political groups , depending on how you wish to define them -- and i 'm not big on definitions .
the personal one is falling off a cliff is actually a good thing , and i recommend it .
there aren 't neat examples , but one example is this : the way the world is changing is embodied in what 's going on at the place i used to work -- the u.n. security council .
the security council does its business in exactly the same way today that it did x number of years ago , when i was there 10 years ago .
in fact , we 're in a phase where transformative change is necessary , which opens the window for innovation , for new ideas and new paradigms .
now , you would have wished the climate pressure to hit a strong planet , a resilient planet , but unfortunately , the third pressure is the ecosystem decline .
the system suddenly , very surprisingly , loses 30 to 40 percent of its summer ice cover .
but we also include , what we call , the slow variables , the systems that , under the hood , regulate and buffer the capacity of the resilience of the planet -- the interference of the big nitrogen and phosphorus cycles on the planet , land use change , rate of biodiversity loss , freshwater use , functions which regulate biomass on the planet , carbon sequestration , diversity .
but it changes fundamentally our governance and management paradigm , from the current linear , command and control thinking , looking at efficiencies and optimization towards a much more flexible , a much more adaptive approach , where we recognize that redundancy , both in social and environmental systems , is key to be able to deal with a turbulent era of global change .
we cannot expand anymore , because it erodes the planetary boundaries .
now , science indicates that , yes , we can achieve a prosperous future within the safe operating space , if we move simultaneously , collaborating on a global level , from local to global scale , in transformative options , which build resilience on a finite planet .
and it 's been used most famously in haiti in the aftermath of the earthquake .
and using cognitive surplus , we 're starting to see truly incredible experiments in scientific , literary , artistic , political efforts .
it is one of the curiosities of our historical era that even as cognitive surplus is becoming a resource we can design around , social sciences are also starting to explain how important our intrinsic motivations are to us , how much we do things because we like to do them rather than because our boss told us to do them , or because we 're being paid to do them .
and so the parents , quite sensibly , said , " 10 shekels to pick my kid up late ?
ushahidi , by contrast , it 's value created by the participants but enjoyed by society as a whole .
let 's look at a specific video so you can see how it works .
and then they benefit through the exposure , advertising and linked sales .
so why has no one ever solved this problem before ?
and actually , chris called me a week after i 'd given my talk and he said , " we 're going to start putting them online .
i meet all kinds of people who don 't think they 're really good at anything .
and you might imagine education would be the way that happens , but too often it 's not .
we must disenthrall ourselves , and then we shall save our country . "
they see no reason to do this .
there was this guy buying a book , he was in his 30s .
about nine years ago , i came across a policy statement -- very well-intentioned -- which said , " college begins in kindergarten . "
i think we have to recognize a couple of things here .
we have to recognize that human flourishing is not a mechanical process ; it 's an organic process .
he says this : " had i the heavens ' embroidered cloths , enwrought with gold and silver light , the blue and the dim and the dark cloths of night and light and the half-light , i would spread the cloths under your feet : but i , being poor , have only my dreams ; i have spread my dreams under your feet ; tread softly because you tread on my dreams . "
but it 's alive with life ; it 's hardly uninhabited .
these are the rarest penguins in the world .
when we have extreme el nino events , you see all this red , and you see no green out here around the galapagos .
and science is important in informing decision makers , and also in changing how we do and knowing the direction of change that we 're going in .
and you can see , in some years over 60 percent of the fledglings were oiled .
and they 're going about , on average now , 40 kilometers farther than they did a decade ago .
and you see , turbo 's pretty intent on his flipper patting .
he unplugs the wire ; we have no data .
and this discovery profoundly changed my view on how i thought the world worked , and it even profoundly changed the way in which i operate in it .
it 's obvious . we go from the clearest thing to the fuzziest thing .
all i did was reverse the order of the information .
here 's the best part : none of what i 'm telling you is my opinion .
again , the goal is not just to sell to people who need what you have ; the goal is to sell to people who believe what you believe .
they believed that if they could figure out this flying machine , it 'll change the course of the world .
the next 34 percent are your early majority , your late majority and your laggards .
people don 't buy what you do ; they buy why you do it .
what if they had said , " if you 're the kind of person who likes to have total control over every aspect of your life , boy , do we have a product for you .
it 's what they believed , and it wasn 't about black versus white : 25 percent of the audience was white .
the good guys arrived , took the cute , mistreated animals and everyone lived happily ever after . "
and on the bottom , my personal favorite , the little male over there , four hours after his release he was together with a wild female .
because that moment when you answer the phone is a cognitive test every time that you do it .
and then wow , what a radical idea , we -- except in the united states -- might be able to use this newfangled technology to actually interact with a nurse or a doctor on the other end of the line .
it was right around new years .
andy grove , about six or seven years ago , he doesn 't even know or remember this , in a fortune magazine article he used the phrase " mainframe healthcare , " and i 've been extending and expanding this .
we are wired , in our imagination , to think about healthcare and healthcare innovation as something that goes into that place .
raise your hand if you had a serious fall in your household , or any of your loved ones , your parents or so forth . right ?
there is all kinds of sort of plug-and-play kind of legos that you can do to capture , in the wild , in the real world , things like tremor , gait , stride length and those kinds of things .
the problem is , intel is still one of the largest funders in the world of independent living technology research .

again though , to make it come alive you need , somehow , to add the human element .
nature is my greatest inspiration .
they scan each individual x-ray .
but people do donate their bodies to art and science .
it 's a surprise that it has humanity , but also man-made , future , alien associations .
not that that is particularly beautiful when you look at it with the human eye , the way the leaves form . they 're curling back on each other .
well , this year is the 50th anniversary of issigonis 's mini , which is one of my favorite cars .
gordon brown : i think it is about global citizenship . it 's about recognizing our responsibilities to others .
there is a great story , again , told about richard nixon .
and at the other end of the beach there is a single brit .
so you 're building on something that is not pure self-interest .
even if , as a human being , you believe that , you can 't say that . you 're elected for britain 's interests .
gb : yes , but i think europe has got a position , which is 27 countries have already come together .
and god shook his head and said , " not this year , not this decade , perhaps not even in your lifetime . "
and the sphere has that balance property that it always sort of stays still and looks the same from every direction .
that 's the sun at that end .
this is another species of work that i do .
so it 's a floating island with water , fresh water , that can fly from place to place .
here the legs are retracting .
it would be forum for people 's ideas about what they would like to see on a giant screen of this type .
who wants to be illogical ?
the difference between arts and sciences is not analytical versus intuitive , right ?
let me say it again another way : science provides an understanding of a universal experience , and arts provides a universal understanding of a personal experience .
where do we want the world to be ?
i want to tell you what i 've been doing a little bit since ... i feel this need to sort of integrate some of the ideas that i 've had and run across over time .
we need to revitalize the arts and sciences of today , we need to take responsibility for the future . we can 't hide behind saying it 's just for company profits , or it 's just a business , or i 'm an artist or an academician .
that soldier had been on top of the bomb .
and so what that means is the kind of things that we used to only talk about at science fiction conventions like comic-con have to be talked about in the halls of power and places like the pentagon .
during the war between israel , a state , and hezbollah , a non-state actor , the non-state actor flew four different drones against israel .
soldiers have a name for these clips .
" you 're going to war for 12 hours , shooting weapons at targets , directing kills on enemy combatants , and then you get in the car and you drive home and within 20 minutes , you 're sitting at the dinner table talking to your kids about their homework . "
but robots are emotionless .
i 'm the weekly tech critic for the new york times .
it 's not your phone -- it 's your computer .
" hi , we have an announcement to -- wah ! ! ! "
jp : oh , it sounds pretty good .
i have two cell phones , so this going to be very odd , if it works .
and then your wife calls , and , " hi honey , leave me a message . "
it works with weather , too .
number two : bagel bakery , commissary department .
" which actors have played james bond ? "
" you may begin speaking at the tone .
the executives at these companies told me , " well we use a proprietary b-to-b , best-of-breed , peer-to-peer soluti -- " you know .
what the f -- ?
dp : oh -- sorry i forgot .
and they said , " oh my gosh , maybe we 've been doing it wrong .
of course . you shake it .
of course , its not just about the iphone .
i too will join the cult .

the next breakthrough is to cut that 10 million in half again .
1970 , the u.s. and most of europe have gotten rid of it .
and that 's happened now in a number of countries .
of course we need drug companies to give us their expertise .
and if you look at the economy , it really is only providing opportunities now to people with a better education .
and we hooked up with some people studying how much variation is there between teachers , between , say , the top quartile -- the very best -- and the bottom quartile .
this chart takes four different factors and says how much do they explain teaching quality .
they take the poorest kids , and over 96 percent of their high school graduates go to four-year colleges .
even a teacher who wants to improve doesn 't have the tools to do it .
it gave you a sense of what a good teacher does .
but the serious part is what threw me , and i couldn 't quite get a handle on it until i remembered an essay .
solemn design is often important and very effective design .
and in my 35 years of working experience , i think i was really serious four times .
and i made these very lush , very elaborate record covers , not because i was being a post-modernist or a historicist -- because i didn 't know what those things were .
and i had that moment in 1994 when i met a theater director named george wolfe , who was going to have me design an identity for the new york shakespeare festival , then known , and then became the public theater .
the high point of the public theater , i think , was in 1996 , two years after i designed it , which was the " bring in ' da noise , bring in ' da funk " campaign that was all over new york .
this is symphony space on 90th street and broadway , and the type is interwoven into the stainless steel and backlit with fiber optics .
people wanted it in big , expensive places .
we made idiotic presentations showing how the citi logo made sense , and how it was really derived from an umbrella , and we made animations of these things , and we came back and forth and back and forth and back and forth .
so , the gallery wanted me to have another show in two years , which meant that i really had to paint these paintings much faster than i had ever done them . and i -- they started to become more political , and i picked areas that sort of were in the news or that i had some feeling about , and i began doing these things .
so , a first idea is to use it on cabinet doors .
so i just wanted to let you know , it 's not actually coming out , just the concept is .
they can be made to automatically roll up , or they can be made stable , like zach 's , to hold any position in between .
zk : i 'd just like to let you all know that this presentation has been brought to you by target .
again , it 's perfectly safe for people . it puts out the fires , doesn 't hurt anything .
for our last technology , we worked again with roman and his team at the directors bureau to develop a commercial from the future to explain how it works .
by detecting the odor of particular bacteria , or viruses , or even lung cancer , the dots will change and they can use software to analyze the results .
who talked about absorption and refrigeration .
it looks like this . this is the fifth prototype . it 's not quite done .
audience : no .
there 's one word i love on that slide .
and this is what richard dawkins was on about in his 1976 bestseller , " the selfish gene . "
but a lot of these problems can be avoided by remembering the definition .
some , it 's quite hard to tell why .
i suppose it 's there to tell you that somebody 's cleaned the place , and it 's all lovely .
so , the big brain , on this theory , is driven by the memes .
we 're at this extraordinary point where we 're nearly there , that there are machines like that .
a very simple equation .
you know all about big brains .
they 're just information , why would they ?
so , those are the two possibilities .
we reached a tipping point this year where living , acting , designing , investing and manufacturing green came to be understood by a critical mass of citizens , entrepreneurs and officials as the most patriotic , capitalistic , geo-political and competitive thing they could do .
people who were really design conscious were inspired by the work of dieter rams , and the objects that he would create for the company called braun .
for example , if you take , and you make a comparison between a recent kind of city , what i 'll call , simplistically , a north american city -- and detroit is not a bad example , it is very car dependent .
and particularly , how can it lead to the creation of buildings which consume less energy , create less pollution and are more socially responsible ?
we were fortunate , because in a way our building was future-proofed .
and on the left are the cutting machines , which then , in the factory , enable those individual pieces to be fabricated and plus or minus very , very few millimeters , to be slotted together on site .
it 's not that long ago , 17 years , and here we are now .
there is an evolution here between the projects , and swiss re again develops that a little bit further -- the project in the city in london .
what if it is the equivalent , depending on where you are , of the grand canal , in terms of tourists , habitation , desalination , agriculture ?
the way in which somebody like kennedy inspirationally could say , " we put a man on the moon . "
and when you look at the brain , it 's obvious that the two cerebral cortices are completely separate from one another .
it 's that ongoing brain chatter that connects me and my internal world to my external world .
and at first i was shocked to find myself inside of a silent mind . but then i was immediately captivated by the magnificence of the energy around me .
and the next thing my brain says to me is , " wow !
and what comes out of my voice is , " woo woo woo woo woo . "
i am the life-force power of the universe .
well , let 's click the zoom lens down one order of magnitude , and look at the century scale .
there 's guilt about our treatment of native peoples in modern intellectual life , and an unwillingness to acknowledge there could be anything good about western culture .
the result is that other people become more valuable alive than dead , and violence declines for selfish reasons . as wright put it , " among the many reasons that i think that we should not bomb the japanese is that they built my mini-van . "
my late , lamented friend bob nozick , a fine philosopher , in one of his books , " philosophical explanations , " is commenting on the ethos of philosophy -- the way philosophers go about their business .
that 's the order of the day here .
it speaks so eloquently to the problem .
you see , the magician doesn 't really saw the lady in half . "
now , this is an example -- one of many -- of a phenomenon that 's now being studied quite a bit .
and as i got closer and closer , i actually screamed .
how many of you did it by rotating the one on the left in your mind 's eye , to see if it matched up with the one on the right ?
can you see the four ways of seeing the cube ?
what you 're going to see is two pictures , one of which is slightly different from the other .
this one because it 's so large and yet it 's pretty hard to see .
when you have 21 minutes to speak , two million years seems like a really long time .
so , just give it a moment of thought .
a system of cognitive processes , largely non-conscious cognitive processes , that help them change their views of the world , so that they can feel better about the worlds in which they find themselves .
" i don 't have one minute 's regret . it was a glorious experience . "
why do we have that belief ?
" the one i got is really better than i thought !
" no problem , jim . all i want you to do is rank these for me from the one you like the most to the one you like the least . "
you 're reading the cartoon as i 'm talking .
and they blow two of them up , and they have two gorgeous eight-by-10 glossies of meaningful things to them , and we say , " which one would you like to give up ? "
have i gotten the right one ? maybe this isn 't the good one ?
but when those preferences drive us too hard and too fast because we have overrated the difference between these futures , we are at risk .
that led to 550 entries from 53 countries .
so , and that means , you know , somebody who is based in mississippi knows more about mississippi than i do . so what happened is , we used meetup and all these other kind of internet tools , and we ended up having 40 chapters starting up , thousands of architects in 104 countries .
so we 've engaged not just designers , but also , you know , a whole variety of technology-based professionals .
this looked at setting up trade routes and economic engines within the community , so it can be a self-sustaining project .
i 'm a consultant and i 'm also the national football player for south africa , bafana bafana , and i also play in the vodacom league for the team called tembisa , which has now changed to siyathemba .
this was raised by hot chocolate sales in atlanta .
and we 're helping , working with them to create a new building .
chris luebkeman will tell you why .
my role is not as a designer ; it 's as a conduit between the design world and the humanitarian world .
we talk about leapfrog technologies . i write with worldchanging , and the one thing we 've been talking about is , i learn more on the ground than i 've ever learned here .
thank you .
