here 's a jelly .
they 're very little understood .
and we 're over the atlantic -- that 's the ridge right there -- but we 're going to go across the caribbean , central america , and end up against the pacific , nine degrees north .
we weren 't really aware that it would be so rich with sulfides , hydrogen sulfides .
now , they normally retract as soon as a crab touches them .
you can see this shrimp is harassing this poor little guy here , and he 'll bat it away with his claw . whack !
all this stuff is happening along that 40,000-mile long mountain range that we 're calling the ribbon of life , because just even today , as we speak , there 's life being generated there from volcanic activity .
there are a number of groups that are proposing that life evolved at these vent sites .
the continents move apart . they come back together .
i 'm sick and tired of us being last .
so it 's no surprise , guys , that 62 percent of bulgarians are not optimistic about the future .
social : 45 years of what ?
i 'm going to give bebko to baba .
autocratic -- do what i say because i 'm the chef .
throughout the animal kingdom , for example : ants . ants play .
and who are the biggest neotenists ?
little exercise just for a second : close your eyes and try to imagine a world without play .
it increases our openness to change .
no way . we 're different . "
there 's nothing holding us back , except our own mentality about play .
you know what , let them use their mobile phone for personal calls -- heaven forbid .
thank you .
we were less interested in whether students can simply reproduce what they have learned in school , but we wanted to test whether they can extrapolate from what they know and apply their knowledge in novel situations .
nobody , and no country , can afford to be there , where performance is poor and there are large social disparities .
they invest in professional development and collaboration and many other things .
but there are some countries which have seen impressive improvements .
a major overhaul of poland 's education helped to dramatically reduce between variability among schools , turn around many of the lowest-performing schools , and raise performance by over half a school year .
but placing a high value on education is just part of the picture .
in bureaucratic school systems , teachers are often left alone in classrooms with a lot of prescription on what they should be teaching .
they make them coherent over sustained periods of time , and they ensure that what they do is consistently implemented .
and all of those pages were reviewed by another 400-plus scientists and reviewers , from 113 countries .
we also fly all over the world looking for this thing .
and each one of the 11 chapters of the ipcc has six to ten subsections .
we will be able to fly into the anatomy of peter 's brain -- literally , fly into his body -- but more importantly , we can look into his mind .
when they control their brain , they can control their pain .
we are increasingly offered a diet in which sensation , not story , is king .
but for my father , the emotional and artistic importance of de sica 's vision was so great that he chose to celebrate his half-century with his three teenage children and 30 of their friends , " in order , " he said , " to pass the baton of concern and hope on to the next generation . "
six thousand reviews each school week vying for the honor of being review of the week .
i was past 40 when my father died .
what we could not have foreseen was the measurable improvements in behavior , confidence and academic achievement .
putting technology in the hands of the end user is usually a good idea because they 've got the best idea of what their needs are .
we genetically engineer bacteria .
i signed up for something called the personal genome project .
you can make some sort of a biofuel cell .
my dad was always whistling around the house , and i just thought that 's part of communication in my family .
and i would have lost my face .
why ? can i go away ? "
okay .
when you have nanotechnology and nanoscience , what 's occurred is that we 're able to now look at atoms and molecules and actually control them for great benefits .
it could be anything that 's anti-icing , because if you don 't have water , you don 't have ice .
and because i had 70 percent of my body burned , it would take about an hour .
i moved to sounds , electrical shocks -- i even had a pain suit that i could get people to feel much more pain .
when the five minutes were over , i would say , " please shred the piece of paper .
again , a lot of people cheated by just by a little bit , and they were insensitive to these economic incentives .
what about increasing the fudge factor ?
in fact , every day when we open the news we see examples of people cheating .
we ran this at carnegie mellon and pittsburgh .
what happens when you do other things , like you remove things from money ?
and she said , " given the fact that i thought my intuition was right ... " -- she thought her intuition was right -- it was very difficult for her to accept doing a difficult experiment to try and check whether she was wrong .
now , those programs can make sense if they in fact induce new location decisions , and the way they can make sense is , by creating more and better jobs , they raise employment rates , raise per capita earnings of state residents .
one of the very interesting facts is that , in addition , we find that even once we hold constant , statistically , the effect of your own education , the education of everyone else in your metropolitan area also affects your wages .
well , the reality is , if you look at the data , americans aren 't as hyper-mobile as people sometimes assume .
now , that 's one barrier .
great idea , but it doesn 't work at all .
it can change the way you communicate with others , it can change your body , it can change your mind . so , we 're trying to go to the next step of how you build on top of something like guitar hero .
to get their hands on music , to shape it themselves , change it , to experiment with it , to make their own music .
every single book is robotic , so they all move , they all make sound , and when you put them all together , they turn into these walls , which have the gesture and the personality of simon powers . so he 's disappeared , but the whole physical environment becomes this person .
he 's very shy , too .
tm : so let 's do it . so dan do you want to tell everyone about what you 're going to play now ?
tm : bravo .
we managed , but sometimes those halls didn 't seem exactly suited to the music i was making or had made .
this is a little bit later .
the halls got bigger . carnegie hall 's fair-sized .
and a new form of music was born .
and they no longer have to be exactly the same .
the music that , i would say , is written for automobile sound systems works perfectly on it .
it 's adaptive .
if you were to ask my friends and family to describe me , that 's what they would tell you .
but the severity of it and the seriousness of it is this : every 30 seconds , every 30 seconds , somewhere , someone in the world takes their own life because of depression , and it might be two blocks away , it might be two countries away , it might be two continents away , but it 's happening , and it 's happening every single day .
you don 't beat it once and it 's gone forever .
it has to start with me , it has to start with you , it has to start with the people who are suffering , the ones who are hidden in the shadows .
and i believe that we can .
we don 't know people from iran .
so for a few days , that 's how my living room was .
who is everybody ? " " everybody . "
they see images of us , and they see bad images .
some girl that we met on facebook never been in israel , born and raised in iran , lives in germany , afraid of israelis because of what she knows about us , decides after a few months of talking on the internet with some israelis to come to israel , and she gets on the plane and arrives at ben gurion and says , " okay , not that big a deal . "
just raise that . exactly .
here is the accumulation at biona creek next to the l.a. airport .
this is mae west , still alive at a zookeeper 's home in new orleans .
we wanted to see if the most common fish in the deep ocean , at the base of the food chain , was ingesting these poison pills .
it 's one of the great questions of our time .
it takes about 10 calories to produce every calorie of food that we consume in the west .
so , if you like , the whole spiritual and physical life of these cities was dominated by the grain and the harvest that sustained them .
and of course billingsgate , famously , was london 's fish market , operating on-site here until the mid-1980s .
and as you can see , some of the earliest train passengers were pigs and sheep .
and we don 't value food . we don 't trust it .
because it 's an ideal . it 's an imaginary thing . we can 't have it .
cows with a view .
and i want us to ask now , what would ambrogio lorenzetti paint if he painted this image today ?
i decided i had to do some research and really figure out what had gone wrong somewhere along the history of airstream .
that trailer led to another commission , to participate in whats called tokyo designers block .
they didn 't want to go to a componentized system .
that was the experience of my patient , chandler , whom you see in the photograph .
and when you turn the switch off , the light goes off .
and we support all of that with an intensive psychotherapy program to address the despondency , despair and depression that always accompanies severe , chronic pain .
so here is a picture of the high seas as seen from above -- that area in the darker blue .
in 2009 , when the u.n. reviewed progress , they discovered that almost 100 million square-kilometers of seabed had been protected .
but unfortunately , ccamlr , the regional commission in charge of conserving and managing fish stocks and other living marine resources , is unfortunately starting to give in to fishing interests and has authorized the expansion of toothfish fisheries in the region .
these happen to go down to a vast south pacific gyre , where they spend most of their time and often end up getting hooked like this , or as bycatch .
many already have transponders on board that allow us to find out where they are and even what they 're doing .
actually , it 's a really big idea .
it was hailed as a scientific miracle in the late 1950s .
and not only that , but when they came into these countries , then they got on commercial jetliners probably and they traveled even farther to other places like russia , where , for the first time in over a decade last year , children were crippled and paralyzed by a disease that they had not seen for years .
it 's been tried six times in the last century , and it 's been successful exactly once .
there 's over 10 million people , probably 20 million people , largely volunteers , who have been working over the last 20 years in what has now been called the largest internationally-coordinated operation in peacetime .
last year , it was 1,000 .
umar also has polio .
we 're working closely with the international committee of the red cross to ensure that we can reach every child .
ladies and gentlemen , with a combination of smart people , smart technology and smart investments , polio can now be eradicated anywhere .
where would you say we need to be the smartest ?
so good luck . we 're all in this with you .
they can connect us to our deepest humanity or with people we 'll never meet .
i feel like the happiest person on earth " " one of these men is the father of my son .
and when she saw him , he was down on one knee , he had the ring out .
he turns four tomorrow . "
i think in some ways , the reason i started the project , even though i didn 't know it at the time , was because i was struggling with my own secrets .
hold your head up . look at me .
he didn 't want cry in front of me , but he knew he wasn 't going to make it back to the city , and it was better me than to allow himself to express these feelings and emotions in front of the women .
his grandmother had two jobs .
for everybody else , we go around like we 've been having sex since we were two .
so now i 'm no longer trying to figure out what i 'm going to do ; i 'm trying to figure out how i 'm going to get out of this room .
i remember asking a nine-year-old boy , i asked a nine-year-old boy , " what would life be like for you , if you didn 't have to adhere to this man box ? "
you sit there , ok .
the first thing you do is lock into a tight body position -- head down in your chest , your arms extended , put over your reserve parachute .
and as soon as i hit , the first thing i did is i 'd see if i 'd broken anything that i needed .
and i 'm not sure that was real interaction .
i have to have trust in them and vice versa .
and one young ranger in the back -- his hair 's tousled and his face is red and windblown from being in combat in the cold afghan wind -- he said , " sir , i was in the sixth grade . "
and it 's a new cumulative pressure on leaders .
i hope it 's not over .
she replied , i also know about [ sanitary pads ] , but myself and my sisters , if they start using that , we have to cut our family milk budget .
close your eyes . "
you need first funds .
play video one .
not in front pocket . i 'm a back pocket man .
this was the big bang , the beginning of the universe .
we have two pieces of observational evidence on the probability of life appearing .
the answers to these big questions show that we have made remarkable progress in the last hundred years .
what a gift it was to the eager , young foreign correspondent that i was then .
the surgeon emerged from the surgery .
they 're exotic . they 're experimental .
and for me , for us , we pushed the fight right over the edge , and i never got the chance to say to him what i say to him now almost every day : " hey , buddy , it was a hell of a ride . "
they say it 's denial .
it 's not a bug .
you know mark antony , the conquering hero , cleopatra 's guy ?
and why not ?
the small farmer in africa today lives a life without much choice , and therefore without much freedom .
we know from our work around the continent that transaction costs of reaching the market , and the risks of transacting in rural , agriculture markets , are extremely high .
this made it unprofitable for some farmers to even harvest the grain from the fields .
that was , of course , the birth of the chicago board of trade , which is the most famous commodity exchange in the world .
in the design of our commodity exchange in ethiopia , we 've done something rather unique , which is to take the approach of an integrated perspective , or what we call the ecx edge .
it will stop them from doing simple , back-to-back , limited arbitrage to really thinking strategically about how to move grain across long distances from [ surplus regions ] to [ deficit areas ] .
i was two years older than my sister at the time -- i mean , i 'm two years older than her now -- but at the time it meant she had to do everything that i wanted to do , and i wanted to play war .
and the latter won out .
and then we tailor the class right towards the average .
and if we can change the lens , not only can we change your happiness , we can change every single educational and business outcome at the same time .
what we found is that only 25 percent of job successes are predicted by i.q.
and the problem is it 's scientifically broken and backwards for two reasons .
we 've done these things in research now in every single company that i 've worked with , getting them to write down three new things that they 're grateful for for 21 days in a row , three new things each day .
" instead , let me sit on a beach somewhere drinking mojitos . "
and to start with , we created a little experiment in which we gave people legos , and we asked them to build with legos .
we asked people , " would you like to build one bionicle for three dollars ? "
so people understand that meaning is important , they just don 't understand the magnitude of the importance , the extent to which it 's important .
i said , " how many of you now go home earlier than you used to ? "
in the first condition , people wrote their name on the sheet , found all the pairs of letters , gave it to the experimenter .
it turns out it was almost like the shredder .
and they thought about all kinds of reasons for that .
how much do you want to pay for it ? "
why ? because now the builders loved it even more .
let me say one last comment .
so i did a spot on cnn the other day where i actually spent more time in makeup than i did talking on air .
or maybe a relationship goes up in smoke because we haven 't had the time , or the patience , or the tranquility , to be with the other person , to listen to them .
but i think if you cut through those forces , you get to what might be the deeper driver , the nub of the question , which is how we think about time itself .
and it 's driven by a very simple and sensible message , which is that we get more pleasure and more health from our food when we cultivate , cook and consume it at a reasonable pace .
i mean , the pointer sisters said it most eloquently , didn 't they , when they sang the praises of " a lover with a slow hand . "
and even if they sometimes do nothing at all .
but the new idea , the sort of revolutionary idea , of the slow movement , is that there is such a thing as " good slow , " too .
i feel like i 'm living my life rather than actually just racing through it .
in october , i spent some time in the democratic republic of congo , which is the [ second ] largest country in africa .
and so i started to look at what the marketing looked like .
half the city is already below sea level .
look no further than the insurance industry as they struggle to cope with mounting catastrophic losses from extreme weather events .
in ethiopia , 70 percent , that 's 7-0 percent of the population , depends on rainfall for its livelihood .
but there might be some changes in store that you might not imagine . for example , planes require more runway for takeoff because the heated , less dense air , provides for less lift .
there are no quick fixes .
so , this is the promise of high modernism : within a single space , actually , any kind of activity can happen .
and in this case , what was getting engulfed were these social responsibilities by the expansion of the book .
we sized them into five compartments .
and it was defended , believe it or not , by the librarians . they said , " look , we don 't know what it is , but we know it 's everything that we need it to be based on the observations that we 've done about the program . "
it allows you to , on one city block , go up one full floor , so that it 's on a continuum .
any portion around the theater actually can be opened discretely .
so now i 'm going to -- this is louisville 's skyline -- and i 'm going to take you through various constraints that led to the project .
so it creates a situation like this , where you have artists who can operate within an art space that also has an amazing view on the 22nd floor , but it also has proximity that the curator can either open or close .
and then i 'm going spend perhaps the second half of the talk talking about , you know , how we might actually be able to prove that fatalism is wrong , namely , by actually doing something about it .
it 's ecologically sound ; it stops the population explosion of foxes . "
i don 't agree with those answers . i think they basically don 't work .
a very simple definition .
just suppose , as i said , that we do acquire -- let 's say we do it today for the sake of argument -- the ability to confer 30 extra years of healthy life on people who are already in middle age , let 's say 55 .
so i think that actually step two , that i called a step a moment ago , isn 't a step at all .
and that 's quite a thought .
15 years from the robust mouse .
the engineering approach does not intervene in any processes .
the answer is : long-lived molecules , because if a short-lived molecule undergoes damage , but then the molecule is destroyed -- like by a protein being destroyed by proteolysis -- then the damage is gone , too .
this is what 's going to take a bit of money .
that means that i 'm one of your subjects to become a 1,000-year-old ?
and then i said to myself , i 've just got to get this thought out of my mind as quickly as possible .
i feels like you 've got a man standing behind you with a hammer just hitting your head all the time .
i have never , ever heard such utter bollocks .
the first one is that just because something has worked in the past so well , doesn 't mean it 's going to work in the future .
ah yes , a table .
no , i have an iphone . of course i do .
it 's inevitable , terrible , but really what i want to talk about is , i 'm just fascinated by the legacy people leave when they die .
as i witnessed my father 's body being swallowed by fire , i sat by his funeral pyre and wrote .
it 's always reminded me of the apollo image of the earth , the blue marble picture , and it 's similarly meant to suggest , i think , that we can 't really understand it as a whole .
and i was embarrassed . i was looking for this thing that only fools seem to look for .
now there are six cables and more coming , three down each coast .
and then once that cable was on shore , they began to prepare to connect it to the other side , for the cable that had been brought down from the landing station .
it has to totally surrender , as one surrenders to an anesthesiologist .
each one has got two games .
it 's experienced by people occasionally .
your moment of happiness reveals that reality , that realization , that recognition : " maybe i am the whole .
to discover the capacity to give and share , you need to be giving and sharing .
ask for compassion .
but i also felt like i saw more animals working with the tiburon than the ventana , two vehicles with the same field of view but different propulsion systems .
what really wowed me about that was the way it came in up over the e-jelly and then attacked the enormous thing next to it , which i think it mistook for the predator on the e-jelly .
this is it . we 're on in two minutes .
should it be by just walking around looking down ?
it was like cell phones strapped to your head .
i 'm still on hold . i 'm listening to the sounds of silence .
there 's not enough help . there 's not enough thought put into the design of it to make it easy and enjoyable to use .
some of the stories are just so classic , and yet so understandable .
let 's create a word processor that 's just a word processor .
they could have put them all out in view .
you have to scroll , like , seven screens-full to get to it .
audience : go on .
they 're dying to throw the whole thing out and start fresh , but they can 't . they 're locked in because so many add-ons and other company stuff locks into the old 1982 chassis .
i still wear sandals in any weather . it 's just that these days , they 're gucci leather .
oh yeah .
my final advice for those of you who are consumers of this technology : remember , if it doesn 't work it 's not necessarily you , ok ?
there were a handful of positions left open from the standard admissions process , and the night before they were supposed to open that for registration , thousands of people lined up outside the gate in a line a mile long , hoping to be first in line to get one of those positions .
of course , he 'd get really bored .
whether it 's akash , who comes from a small town in india and would never have access in this case to a stanford-quality course and would never be able to afford it .
so , for example , some students might benefit from a little bit of preparatory material that other students might already have .
one needs to build in much more meaningful practice questions , and one also needs to provide the students with feedback on those questions .
and so this is an effective strategy that can be used for grading at scale , and is also a useful learning strategy for the students , because they actually learn from the experience .
you can use these data to understand fundamental questions like , what are good learning strategies that are effective versus ones that are not ?
imagine if we could teach so that 98 percent of our students would be above average .
so maybe this is how we should spend our time at universities .
i had a slide that said breakdown .
why did you bring this up ? have you lost your mind ?
it fuels our daily lives .
our family motto is " lock and load . "
and so i want to walk you in to shame .
and everybody just burst into applause , and they were like " yes ! "
that 's what life is about , about daring greatly , about being in the arena .
there 's a huge difference between shame and guilt .
for men , shame is not a bunch of competing , conflicting expectations .
he asked , what do women need to do to conform to female norms ?
unfortunately , at that time we did not know that that was not exactly where we should be looking , because we had to go much deeper in , and so the research came to a halt , and it was only taken up in 2000 thanks to the interest and the enthusiasm of the guinness family .
so that was a good result . sometimes , it 's not that good , and so , again , authenticity and science could go together and change the way , not attributions being made , but at least lay the ground for a more objective , or , i should rather say , less subjective attribution , as it is done today .
and if you want to summarize in one just single word , well , this is what we 're trying to do .
now , we 'll perform " cloudburst " for you .
i know a gentleman , married for 25 years , who 's longing to hear his wife say , " thank you for being the breadwinner , so i can stay home with the kids , " but won 't ask .
i get the same bike back , and they 've taken all the little warps out of those same wheels i 've had for two and a half years , and my bike is like new .
the digital universe atlas has been built at the american museum of natural history over the past 12 years .
this map can be updated , and we can add in new data .
thank you .
so reconciling our need for security and our need for adventure into one relationship , or what we today like to call a passionate marriage , used to be a contradiction in terms .
forgone conclusion does not keep our interest .
and so , when i see my partner on his own or her own , doing something in which they are enveloped , i look at this person and i momentarily get a shift in perception , and i stay open to the mysteries that are living right next to me .
is it a place where you can finally surrender and not have to take responsibility for everything ?
" i shut myself off when ... " began to be the question .
but if on this side there is somebody who says , " i 'm worried . i 'm anxious . i 'm depressed .
so in this dilemma about reconciling these two sets of fundamental needs , there are a few things that i 've come to understand erotic couples do .
i simply tied the end of a paintbrush onto a twig .
that , i think , is movement .
we discovered bluegrass a few years ago , and we fell in love with it . we hope you guys will too .
what would these unseen forms look like ?
and if we change where we make the folds , if we change the folding ratio , then this cube turns into this one .
white surfaces have long edges , black ones have short ones .
an architect who 's drawing them with a pen and a paper would probably take months , or it would take even a year to draw all the sections , all of the elevations , you can only create something like this through an algorithm .
and this is a photo now , it 's not a rendering , and the column that we ended up with after a lot of work , ended up looking remarkably like the one that we had designed in the computer .
fifty years ago in the old soviet union , a team of engineers was secretly moving a large object through a desolate countryside .
and the reactions to sputnik went far beyond weapons increases .
i 've been there six times : four times i did work with national geographic , making tectonic plate measurements ; twice , i went with nasa doing remote sensing devices .
this was our expedition .
a fall here , if you weren 't roped in , would be 5,000 feet down .
so here are some climbers starting out for the summit on what 's called the triangular face .
and it 's not a straight path at all , it 's very difficult climbing , and there 's always the risk of falling on either side .
they tried to radio a message to rob hall , who was a superb climber stuck , sort of , with a weak climber up near the summit .
there was no way we could get up high enough to rescue him .
this climber was snow blind .
and beck told me that story very quietly , but i was absolutely stunned by it .
it 's too cold ; he can 't keep his metabolic fires going , and , you see , there 's no more red here ; his brain is quieting down .
he 's not thinking about his family now , and he 's getting himself motivated .
thank you .
so a real skyrocketing of chronic childhood disease that includes other things like obesity and juvenile diabetes , premature puberty .
and as a result , these exposed males lose their testosterone , they 're chemically castrated , and they 're subsequently feminized because now they 're making the female hormone .
however , if we parents are unaware , we are leaving our children to fend for themselves .
we already know that chemicals like ddt and des and atrazine can also pass over into milk , again , affecting our babies even after their born .
and this was something that was really brought home to me a year ago when i found out i was pregnant and the first scan revealed that my baby had a birth defect associated with exposure to estrogenic chemicals in the womb and the second scan revealed no heartbeat .
as evident in this slide from lake nabugabo in uganda , the agricultural runoff from this crop , which goes into these buckets , is the sole source of drinking , cooking and bathing water for this village .
and the model of 4g is quite simple : companies cannot afford to be just innocent bystanders in what 's happening around in society .
we are a company that sells soap and soup .
by the way , that 's equivalent to one month of water for a whole huge continent .
and through all of this , i had to hold a torch between my teeth .
but the story is not about these chapters .
far away over there is now here .
i can order foreign language books in the middle of the night , shop for parisian macarons , and leave video messages that get picked up later .
they 're like soap bubbles that disappear when we touch them .
we can slow down and we can tune in to the ebb and flow of time .
and then the second time i tried it , the counselor came up to me with a concerned expression on her face and she repeated the point about camp spirit and said we should all work very hard to be outgoing .
shyness is about fear of social judgment .
i 'll give you some examples .
and he says that he never would have become such an expert in the first place had he not been too introverted to leave the house when he was growing up .
and if you look at the self-help books from this era , they all had titles with things like " character , the grandest thing in the world . "
here 's margaret atwood , " cat 's eye . "
and that 's a lot harder for me , because as honored as i am to be here with all of you right now , this is not my natural milieu .
be like buddha , have your own revelations .
those are pretty good escapes from the drab weather in switzerland .
so , i had to start on my own . so i moved to san francisco , and i started a little company , fuseproject .
so , all of these projects have a humanistic sense to them , and i think as designers we need to really think about how we can create a different relationship between our work and the world , whether it 's for business , or , as i 'm going to show , on some civic-type projects .
and then , of course , design is never done .
this girl is going to school with a laptop on her head .
it 's because we were able to run , during the manufacturing process , 20 colors for the x and the o , which is the name of the computer , and by mixing them on the manufacturing floor , you get 20 times 20 : you get 400 different options there .
it was breaking the ice , it was getting over a stigma , and i think that 's also what design can do .
but i knew so many of the things they were up against , so many of the struggles they were dealing with .
so the idea was that we would be working on whatever we 're working on , at 2 : 30 p.m. the students flow in and you put down what you 're doing , or you trade , or you work a little bit later or whatever it is .
this is replacement eyes in case you lose one .
immediately , she made the inroads with the teachers and the parents and the students and everything , and so suddenly it was actually full every day .
these adults , they 're working in their field .
so every day , there 's a field trip where they together create a book -- you can see it being typed up above .
they work under the teacher 's guide , and it 's all in one big room .
now we 're sort of addicted to the book thing .
this is a field trip going on . and so they would be shopping , and they might be more likely to buy some lard , or millet for their parrot , or , you know , a hook , or hook protector for nighttime , all of these things we sell .
these are some of the products . these are all handmade .
came in . got this concentrated attention .
profound leaps forward !
the schools need you . the teachers need you .
there isn 't a dog on this earth that 's a natural creature .
and so one of the things we 've been doing is using genetic enhancement , or genetic manipulation , of normal selective breeding pushed a little bit through genetics .
other states have banned them .
and then in addition , transgenic pigs , knockout pigs , from the national institute of animal science in south korea , are pigs that they are going to use , in fact , to try to create all kinds of drugs and other industrial types of chemicals that they want the blood and the milk of these animals to produce for them , instead of producing them in an industrial way .
they can make them go left , right . they can make them take off .
they then hooked it up to a prosthetic arm , which you see here in the picture , put the arm in another room .
he altered this mouse so that it was genetically engineered to have skin that was less immunoreactive to human skin , put a polymer scaffolding of an ear under it and created an ear that could then be taken off the mouse and transplanted onto a human being .
and then the final step of this , once we perfect these technologies in animals and we start using them in human beings , what are the ethical guidelines that we will use then ?
this happens 160 times per second , and if anything fails in this process , rezero would immediately fall to the ground .
rezero could be used in exhibitions or parks .
she came to see me after discovering a breast lump .
and although breast density generally declines with age , up to a third of women retain dense breast tissue for years after menopause .
in a study funded by over 25 million taxpayer dollars , digital mammography was found to be no better over all than traditional mammography , and in fact , it was worse in older women .
now , take a look at this cartoon that accompanied gladwell 's article , and tell me if you see something disturbing about this depiction of innovative thinkers .
the duct tape is gone , and we added a second detector on top of the breast , which has further improved our tumor detection .
the digital mammogram was read as normal and shows lots of dense tissue , but the mbi shows an area of intense uptake , which correlated with a two-centimeter tumor .
after the fourth rejection , we requested reconsideration of the manuscript , because we strongly suspected that one of the reviewers who had rejected it had a financial conflict of interest in a competing technology .
mammography 's the only one that 's been around long enough to have a chance of making that claim .
rather than using it for my computer , i actually opened it .
i was taking some part of the objects , or any of the intuitiveness of real life , and bringing them to the digital world , because the goal was to make our computing interfaces more intuitive .
and , actually , if you see , there are some color markers that in the beginning version we are using with it .
when i 'm going back , i can just use my boarding pass to check how much my flight has been delayed , because at that particular time , i 'm not feeling like opening my iphone , and checking out a particular icon .
and why only computers ? we can just play with papers .
open source ? wow .
dh : thank you .
i 'm now pushing my luck : i 'm skipping right to six cups .
dh : now richard , please ...
rw : hmmm .
dh : let 's jump this way , though .
dh : all right , we 'll do this trick , but please remember it took us over 10 years to perfect .
bf : this one 's a little ... who 's doing the lights ? could you point that a little more directly into my eyeballs ? is that possible ? i can still see a little .
weird , no one dances . we 're two guys doing this .
dh : that 's a pretty good setup , richard .
[ unclear ] eagerly awaits your next syllable . what will it be ?
dh : thank you very much !
and so for her , i put in a human meniscus allograft donor right into that [ knee ] joint space .
and that 's great when i can degrade the tissue .
we can use thicker , younger , better tissues than you might have injured in your knee , or that you might have when you 're 40 , 50 or 60 .
there 's a few hundreds of mammals -- six million species of insects .
but the small animals that eat insects are being eaten by larger animals , still larger animals .
but there 's tomatoes that end up in a soup , and as long as they meet the requirements of the food agency , there can be all kinds of things in there , no problem .
and that 's especially because this world population is increasing , and it 's increasing , not only in numbers , but we 're also getting wealthier , and anyone that gets wealthier starts to eat more and also starts to eat more meat .
and a pig disease , a pig virus , and a human virus can both proliferate , and because of their kind of reproduction , they can combine and produce a new virus .
now there 's a big " if , " of course , and it is if insects produce meat that is of good quality .
you can vary enormously .
and they 're being made in the most wonderful ways .
i want to talk about what we learn from conservatives .
okay , but no , this is really besides the point .
and the second great thing about conservatives : they get ecology .
and san franciscans thought they had to do the same as well .
i think it 's important that we keep these two different kinds of public goods in mind .
okay , for a second example , think about this cultural hero , icon on the left , creator of this character .
so that we go from a " all rights reserved " world to a " some rights reserved " world so that people can know the freedoms they have attached to the content , building and creating on the basis of this creative copyrighted work .
" i will not put tacks on the teacher 's chair .
now , if we can learn those values from at least some influences on the right , if we can take them and incorporate them , maybe we could do a little trade .
there is no way back home .
finally , my favorite student , she looks me straight in the eye , and she says , " the reading sucked . "
because it took a lot of crafty work to infect this bacterium .
on the [ right ] is the lysogenic way that uses secret agent viruses .
for example , i told you that viruses have dna .
i 'm reminded of what the architect mies van der rohe said , and i paraphrase , when he said that sometimes you have to lie in order to tell the truth .
why don 't you say , " listen , let me tell you a story " ?
we did the line install over the summer .
and these job losses , we can fix them with green-collar jobs .
so it 's very useful .
so they hire us to visualize their power and money by making monumental architecture .
we built 50 units to do that as a monitoring test for the durability and moisture and termites , so on .
it was meant to stay there for three years , but actually it stayed there 10 years because people loved it .
he said , " as long as you bring your money , you can do it . "
about 20 days before the japanese earthquake happened , also they had a big earthquake , and many japanese students were also killed , and the most important cathedral of the city , the symbol of christchurch , was totally destroyed .
and selam means peace in many ethiopian languages .
i was the first person to actually drive a car to the spot .
well , he was very tired , and it 's really tiring .
so she belongs to our family tree , but within that , of course , you do detailed analysis , and we know now that she belongs to the lucy species , known as australopithecus afarensis .
that 's why they can cope with their environment very easily after birth -- faster than us , anyway .
up to now , the knowledge that we had about our ancestors came essentially from adult individuals because the fossils , the baby fossils , were missing .
i think it 's important to promote in a more positive way on how we see ourselves .
and if we record from lots of different neurons , we 'll see that different neurons fire when the animal goes in different parts of its environment , like in this square box shown here .
but on some trials , we could change the shape and size of the environment like we did with the place cell .
and that would be represented by the firing of boundary-detecting cells .
but , this is not the beginning of the 20th century .
up until that moment , i had been that classic corporate warrior -- i was eating too much , i was drinking too much , i was working too hard and i was neglecting the family .
i 'm talking about all companies .
have sex .
and to be balanced , i believe we have to attend to all of those areas -- not just do 50 stomach crunches .
moreover , i think , it can transform society .
even if you get your values from religion , even if you think that good and evil ultimately relate to conditions after death -- either to an eternity of happiness with god or an eternity of suffering in hell -- you are still concerned about consciousness and its changes .
and i think of this as kind of a moral landscape , with peaks and valleys that correspond to differences in the well-being of conscious creatures , both personal and collective .
the concept of physical health is undefined .
but it clearly admits some exceptions .
i mean , is this the optimal environment in which to raise our children ?
he 's a string theorist .
it is possible for individuals , and even for whole cultures , to care about the wrong things , which is to say that it 's possible for them to have beliefs and desires that reliably lead to needless human suffering .
i think i understood you to say that you could reconcile that with a world that doesn 't become one dimensional , where we all have to think the same .
given my ted profile , you might be expecting that i 'm going to speak to you about the latest philanthropic trends -- the one that 's currently got wall street and the world bank buzzing -- how to invest in women , how to empower them , how to save them .
but you 're young , you could still try again . "
soon after i returned from beijing , i leapt at the chance to work for this wonderful organization , founded by women , to support women 's rights organizations around the globe .
and after he would leave , women and girls would stay behind .
so lesbor , we blend the two .
among layma 's friends was a policewoman who was muslim .
and the next thing you know , the police have disappeared .
and they need allies from their communities .
" what 's up with the chinese character i keep seeing by the side of the road ? "
so what i want to do today is , first of all , talk about why we get stuck inside this feeling of being right .
when we 're wrong about something -- not when we realize it , but before that -- we 're like that coyote after he 's gone off the cliff and before he looks down .
because according to this , getting something wrong means there 's something wrong with us .
and when you feel that way , you 've got a problem to solve , which is , how are you going to explain all of those people who disagree with you ?
it 's totally fundamental to who we are .
and something else happened instead .
and to me , if you really want to rediscover wonder , you need to step outside of that tiny , terrified space of rightness and look around at each other and look out at the vastness and complexity and mystery of the universe and be able to say , " wow , i don 't know .
when i asked , " who is that ? "
she 's 19 ; her dream is to go to college to be able to support them .
and then someone asked me , just before my tedtalk , a few days ago , " so where is the hope ? "
this is the dream of the african girl .
i 've also been to places in this u.s. , and i know that girls in this country also have wishes , a wish for a better life somewhere in the bronx , a wish for a better life somewhere in downtown l.a. , a wish for a better life somewhere in texas , a wish for a better life somewhere in new york , a wish for a better life somewhere in new jersey .
and we could not find 25 girls in high school .
we , the beneficiaries of globalization , seem to exploit these victims with every purchase we make , and the injustice feels embedded in the products themselves .
other subjects came up almost never , including living conditions that to me looked close to prison life : 10 or 15 workers in one room , 50 people sharing a single bathroom , days and nights ruled by the factory clock .
how long should i stay in this factory ?
in 1941 , the burnished patina of an all-american baseball glove inspired the founder of coach to create a new collection of handbags from the same luxuriously soft gloved-hand leather .
this purse is also a reminder that the things that you imagine , sitting in your office or in the library , are not how you find them when you actually go out into the world .
thank you very much .
belshazzar , his son , decides to have a feast .
and more important , he will let them all recover the gods , the statues , the temple vessels that had been confiscated .
it was the largest empire the world had known until then .
and it enters now another story .
god , we know , is usually on the side of the big battalions .
cyrus cylinder : guarantor of the shah .
is iran still to be the defender of the oppressed ?
any of you get really freaked out by that ?
we were giving them all sorts of reasons to adapt new ways .
here , she 's trying to get a piece of meat out of a tube .
some students went out and netted some crows , brought them in , and were -- weighed them , and measured them and whatnot , and then let them back out again .
so , they 're learning from each other . and research bears this out .
so , when they get really used to that , we move on to the crows coming back .
that crow enjoys a temporary monopoly on peanuts , until his friends figure out how to do it , and then there we go .
and they had discussed things of great national importance .
and from a distance it appears that it 's a single group .
it 's not enough to simply write people off .
what kind of innovation would get done ?
that is a meeting of a stage three tribe .
one of their stated values is , " be a little bit weird . "
i don 't want to talk like they do at the particular dmv that 's close to where dave lives .
48 percent of working tribes say , these are employed tribes , say , " i 'm great and you 're not . "
in fact , that 's progress .
and they found a way to do the first-ever world poll .
we also see that this region has the least capability in terms of dealing with the disease .
a close look at how the technology works : these are channels that are about the size of a human hair -- so you have integrated valves , pumps , mixers and injectors -- so you can fit entire diagnostic experiments onto a microfluidic system .
now the way that plants transmit that information is through pollen .
they have to try and attract pollinators to do their bidding .
and under the scanning electron microscope , you can see the surface there -- really quite different from the other surfaces we looked at .
it 's really horrible .
there 's a thermoregulation mechanism in there that keeps constant temperature .
and that 's a real fantastic bull 's eye .
don 't they just pop into your head ?
she questions him , " what kind of a person are you going to be ? "
and you continue to make connections .
they aren 't told by their boss or anyone , they just do it .
you know this gentleman , right ?
if he was an ideal teacher , he would have responded like i said before , " young-ha may not have a talent for drawing , but he has a gift for making up stories , " and he would have encouraged me .
they get locked in .
we become dictators with a remote and start to criticize the people on tv .
so i give them blank sheets of paper and a theme .
they are devils . devils .
someone is a golfer by day and writer by night .
and also start with a little bit of statistics .
at that time at the beginning of the ' 90s , we had that problem , which was , you know , survival below one side , but what was really painful for me was , remember , the beginning of the ' 90s , yugoslavia is falling apart .
i gave him what i thought was a brilliant explanation of the political situation and explained how hard and difficult the war will be .
at the end of the meeting he says , look , it is not going to work ; you will never see your money back ; but my foundations will put 500,000 dollars so you can test the idea .
that means that they have no sports ; they have no latest news ; circulation goes down .
what do we typically finance ?
so give me the paper for nine months . i 'll give it back to you .
all of those , not all , half of those problems mentioned last night -- government accountability , corruption , how do you fight corruption , giving voice to unheard , to poor -- it 's why independent media is in business .
and then two weeks later , iqbal quadir can issue his electricity in bangladesh bonds .
but i don 't really tell stories in the usual way , in the sense that i don 't usually tell my own stories .
then , knowing the geographical location and the time , we can also then figure out the weather when that person wrote the sentence .
" i feel a bit better now . "
in weather , the feelings assume the physical characteristics of the weather that they represent , so that the ones collected on a sunny day swirl around as if they 're part of the sun .
so here are some of my favorite montages that have been collected : " i feel so much of my dad alive in me that there isn 't even room for me . "
you can sift through this data and see what people have submitted .
if we could make new pictures in the sky , what would we draw ?
it 's using the api of a really great company that i work with in new york , actually , called daylife .
any of those can be opened up .
you 'll notice that in daylife -- rather , in universe -- it supports both the notion of a global mythology , which is represented by something as broad as , say , 2007 , and also a personal mythology .
of course , with agriculture came the first big civilizations , the first cities built of mud and brick , the first empires .
let me just say that every unsecured transaction is a good example of a prisoner 's dilemma .
she looked at thousands of cases of humans sharing watersheds , forestry resources , fisheries , and discovered that yes , in case after case , humans destroyed the commons that they depended on .
now none of these companies are doing this out of altruism ; they 're doing it because they 're learning that a certain kind of sharing is in their self-interest .
i think we need to begin developing maps of this territory so that we can talk about it across disciplines .
next thing you know , two guys in white appear .
now let me set another example .
whenever you see young people in front of the road trying to fraternize with the police or military , somebody was thinking about it before .
this is dynamics between fear and apathy on one side and enthusiasm and humor on another side .
don 't mix tools with the substance .
if you look at the last 35 years and different social transitions from dictatorship to democracy , you will see that out of 67 different cases , in 50 of these cases it was nonviolent struggle which was the key power .
and ronald reagan said , " i don 't care what kind of communist he is ! "
then take iran itself , and what people are doing today : following what happened to neda , people who are preventing the security services of iran finding those people who are blogging out of iran , any by everybody who is blogging , changing their address to tehran , iran , and making it difficult for the security services .
climate change cannot be solved in one country , but has got to be solved by the world working together .
she was 11 years old ; her parents had both died from aids , her mother and then her father .
so we have got to create in this world also institutions for peacekeeping and humanitarian aid , but also for reconstruction and security for some of the conflict-ridden states of the world .
and so they asked me if i would come and see rosalie , the old lady .
and she said , " no , it 's not like a dream . it 's like a movie . "
this was originally described , " i said , " right back in the 18th century , by a man called charles bonnet .
his vision was pretty poor .
with him and with rosalie , what seems to be going on -- and rosalie said , " what 's going on ? " -- and i said that as you lose vision , as the visual parts of the brain are no longer getting any input , they become hyperactive and excitable , and they start to fire spontaneously .
why kermit ?
you hear the traffic . all the senses are involved .
it 's activated when one recognizes cartoons , when one draws cartoons , and when one hallucinates them .
when these were first described , it was thought that they could be interpreted like dreams .
and i see the geometrical hallucinations .
i started working in the industry , but i wasn 't really happy to contribute to a material consumer society in a linear , extracting and manufacturing mode .
very , very simple .
this is our team in mozambique : one tanzanian trainer , who transfers the skills to these three mozambican fellows .
already the old chinese and the greek , hippocrates , have actually published , documented , that t.b. can be diagnosed based on the volatiles exuding from patients .
so this is really considerable .
ok .
also , one of the principles of creativity is to have a little childhood trauma .
it 's a wonderful way to look at these questions , when you write a story .
and so , i am going to just throw in string theory here , and just say that creative people are multidimensional , and there are 11 levels , i think , of anxiety .
there 's an ambiguity of what that should be that we should do , and then we do something .
why or why not ?
in this case , i was writing a story that included some kind of detail , period of history , a certain location .
and this was exactly the meaning of my story at that point .
and so i was there on three occasions , different seasons .
and to imagine is to put myself in that story , until there was only -- there is a transparency between me and the story that i am creating .
this is the map of verified users on twitter and the connections between them .
egan convinced the new yorker to start a new yorker fiction account from which they could tweet all of these lines that she created .
as you begin to play with flexible identity online , it gets even more interesting as you start to interact with the real world .
and so the author , dan sinker , who was a journalist , who was completely anonymous this whole time , i think dan -- it made a lot of sense for him to turn this into a book , because it was a narrative format in the end , and i think that turning it into a book is representative of this idea that he had created something new that needed to be translated into previous formats .
[ sanskrit ] this is an ode to the mother goddess , that most of us in india learn when we are children .
i wanted to go from where i was to where i wanted to be , for which i needed something .
but i needed something else .
mine was that of durga , durga the fearless one .
and given that we do -- and that 's the assumption everybody , i think , in this room would make -- when was that ?
because if we go far enough back , we share a common ancestry with every living thing on earth .
and he did a pretty good job .
a point beyond which you don 't know anything else about your ancestors , and you enter this dark and mysterious realm we call history that we have to feel our way through with whispered guidance .
it doesn 't happen very often . we have a proofreading mechanism built in .
within the last 200,000 years , we all share an ancestor , a single person -- mitochondrial eve , you might have heard about her -- in africa , an african woman who gave rise to all the mitochondrial diversity in the world today .
most of britain , all of scandinavia , covered by ice several kilometers thick .
the tool styles don 't change that much .
the grasslands at that time -- this was during the last ice age -- stretched basically from germany all the way over to korea , and the entire continent was open to them .
people who have lived in the same location for a long period of time retain a connection to the place where they live that many of the rest of us have lost .
projects around the world -- documenting oral poetry in sierra leone , preserving traditional weaving patterns in gaza , language revitalization in tajikistan , etc . , etc .
i couldn 't understand the starvation , the destruction , the killing of innocent people .
the point was that i would have something to hook the questions of -- is humankind fundamentally evil ?
and the reason why 21 was the number is 700 men left , 23 came back , two died on the boat and 21 hit the ground .
and that was kind of like the launch of this thing .
i 've recorded 44,000 young people .
that was an incredible moment .
it 's not going to work ; you 're not going to stop the fighting in afghanistan ; the taliban won 't listen , etc . , etc .
because if we start pumping it up a bit maybe more people would listen and there 'd be more -- when we got into certain areas , maybe there would be more people interested .
i mean , we basically sat down with everybody -- in and out of schools with ministers of education , holding these press conferences , which of course , now were loaded with press , everybody was there .
they were the people who believed in peace and the possibilities of it , etc . , etc . -- and they made it real .
and we 'll globally link with government , inter-government , non-government , education , unions , sports .
is this possible ? is it really possible that we could do this ? "
they want what we want for our children and that is for their children to grow up successful , to be healthy , and to have a successful life .
they take real-time data and immediately feed it back into the product .
coke 's been in africa since 1928 , but most of the time they couldn 't reach the distant markets , because they had a system that was a lot like in the developed world , which was a large truck rolling down the street .
that is having real impact in a country like ethiopia , and it 's why you see their child mortality numbers coming down 25 percent from 2000 to 2008 .
k 'naan : oh oh oh oh oh o-oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh o-oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh o-oh give you freedom , give you fire give you reason , take you higher see the champions take the field now you define us , make us feel proud in the streets our heads are lifted as we lose our inhibition celebration , it 's around us every nation , all around us melinda french gates : it feels pretty good , right ?
i 've even seen it used for a chicken coop .
well , why is all of this so important ?
well on september 4th , there was a huge mop-up campaign , which is what you do in polio .
thank you .
they 're mining blood density levels .
oxygen , hydrogen and zinc have their own signature .
inspire us to think of new ways that we can use this unique instrument that we 've created at santa barbara .
we shall not find a single foot of earth that can be planted with crops to raise food . so it is no use .
the north pole is slap bang in the middle of the sea , so i 'm traveling over the frozen surface of the arctic ocean .
all five of them turned and started walking back to the coast and all five died on that return journey .
thank you very much .
this folder has 17,000 photos -- over 20 gigabytes of information -- and it 's growing constantly .
and again , i kept on going , looking for more reference , every bit of reference i could find -- drawings , beautiful photos .
and then there is this fourth level , which is a whole new object in the world : the prop made for the movie , the representative of the thing , becomes , in its own right , a whole other thing , a whole new object of desire .
i spray it on for about three or four days , it drips to hell , but it allows me a really , really nice gentle sanding surface and i can get it glass-smooth .
and it turned out that one of the guys there , a friend of mine that i never actually met , but befriended through some prop deals , was the manager of a local foundry .
i had figured out the exact amount of shrinkage i achieved going from a wax master to a bronze master and blown this up big enough to make a 3d lithography master of this , which i will polish , then i will send to the mold maker and then i will have it done in bronze . or : there are several people who own originals , and i have been attempting to contact them and reach them , hoping that they will let me spend a few minutes in the presence of one of the real birds , maybe to take a picture , or even to pull out the hand-held laser scanner that i happen to own that fits inside a cereal box , and could maybe , without even touching their bird , i swear , get a perfect 3d scan . and i 'm even willing to sign pages saying that i 'll never let anyone else have it , except for me in my office , i promise .
so the possibility exists to simply externally wrap the pipe .
we then use that former to manufacture a perfectly bespoke porous textile mesh , which takes the shape of the former and perfectly fits the aorta .
even trips to the dentist require that you take antibiotics , in case you get an internal infection on the valve .
and then we realized that it was actually a mirror image of the real aorta .
so any of the hospitals interested can come along , read the nice report get in touch with us and then get doing it themselves .
it really is a problem . it really is a problem .
because i suspect there are absolutely standard surgical treatments probably in the usa which cost more for a one-off patient than the cost of us getting from my dream to my reality .
of that stuff , what do you carry ?
money is useful for buying food , sustenance , among all its other uses .
and that 's that moment when you 're walking out of a space , and you turn around , and quite often you tap your pockets .
so , the u.n. estimated -- this is 2004 figures -- that there are almost 800 million people who can 't read and write , worldwide .
and instead of using that money to top up my own phone , i call up the local village operator .
this is from a workbench in jilin city , in china , and you can see people taking down a phone and putting it back together .
and yes , this is quite trivial , but actually the lessons from this can apply to that kind of personal area networks .
if you want a big idea , you need to embrace everyone on the planet , that 's the first thing .
now , that is only a little bit hyperbolic .
our demand for meat , dairy and refined carbohydrates -- the world consumes one billion cans or bottles of coke a day -- our demand for these things , not our need , our want , drives us to consume way more calories than are good for us .
three : their production has been supported by government agencies at the expense of a more health- and earth-friendly diet .
if you strung all of them -- chickens , cows , pigs and lambs -- to the moon , they 'd go there and back five times , there and back .
there was no snack food , and until the ' 20s , until clarence birdseye came along , there was no frozen food .
in new york , an orange was a common christmas present , because it came all the way from florida .
well , they kept them alive .
we weren 't all hippies , either .
meat , junk food , cheese : the very stuff that will kill you .
and this amount is predicted to double in the next 40 years or so .
the usda is not our ally here .
this is at the korean advanced institute of science and technology .
so , if they achieve human level intelligence or , quite possibly , greater than human levels of intelligence , this could be the seeds of hope for our future .
and i 'm here today to give you a little tour , starting from the very first puzzle i designed , through what i 'm doing now .
i created something new , i was very excited because , you know , i 'd made crossword puzzles , but that 's sort of like filling in somebody else 's matrix .
at worst , they 're throwaways , they 're for amusement .
i 'll show you just a couple others . here we have the numbers one through 10 , the digits zero through nine , actually .
well , you can 't do that physically , but on a computer you can do it . let 's switch over to the p.c.
well , move the blue one out of the way .
in discover magazine , i 'm an investigative puzzle maker .
gets you thinking about color .
a lot of people do sudoku . in fact some doctors prescribe it .
yeah , that one is easy . okay . so , ahhh ! okay on to the next one .
and sometimes we make real plans .
i called it " serious nonsense " because on the serious side , i use a technique of painstaking realism of editorial illustration from when i was a kid . i copied it and i never unlearned it -- it 's the only style i know . and it 's very kind of staid and formal .
the zeppelin -- this was from a brochure about the zeppelin based , obviously , on the hindenburg .
those , for example , are mark iv british tanks from 1916 .
people wrote in for reprints of that thing .
this is a big joke .
it 's an augmented reality projection tracking and mapping system , or a digital storytelling tool .
bye-bye .
that 's him pressing my buttons back there , which he does all the time .
good .
residents were often given less than a month 's notice before their buildings were razed .
we secured 20 million dollars to build first-phase projects .
it 's better to ask for forgiveness than permission .
because on top of that , the world 's richest sports team is replacing the house that ruth built by destroying two well-loved community parks .
his administration narrowed key municipal thoroughfares from five lanes to three , outlawed parking on those streets , expanded pedestrian walkways and bike lanes , created public plazas , created one of the most efficient bus mass-transit systems in the entire world .
i don 't think he understood that i wasn 't asking for funding .
but i said we can 't get rid of it , because all the people who tried to transplant heart valves found out you can 't get rid of that immunity .
and that dna aptamer will attach specifically to a target that you have selected for it .
and they lived away then .
they are now buying cars .
so what about the poorest two billion ?
what has happened ? i start the world . here we go .
we can have a much more just world .
he grabbed his pen , he snatched his scissors .
and for that , the audience -- the lovely , beautiful audience -- would live happily ever after .
there 's sort of illegal hustles , like you run a barbershop out of your cell .
how many of you are checking it right now ?
that means there 's good news , because for every unit of energy we save , we save the other nine .
inspired by this insight , my friend dan yates and i started a company called opower .
but the most overlooked resource to get us to a sustainable energy future , it isn 't on this slide .
" and for the last two weeks , all we can think about , talk about , and even argue about , is what we should be doing to save energy .
they had profound intellectual disabilities .
they also learn to follow other people 's gaze , because whatever people are looking at is what they are thinking about .
now , what she is doing right now is that her path of learning is diverging moment by moment as she is isolating herself further and further .
but it diminishes considerably .
well , this is my colleague warren jones , with whom we 've been building these methods , these studies , for the past 12 years , and you see there a happy five-month-older , it 's a five-month little boy who is going to watch things that are brought from his world , his mom , the caregiver , but also experiences that he would have were he to be in his daycare .
it 's almost as if that stimulus , you , you 're not exerting influence on what happens as they navigate their daily lives .
and there are those individuals who have incredible artistic abilities .
so how can we change this dynamic ?
when my wife and i adopted these family meetings and other techniques into the lives of our then-five-year-old twin daughters , it was the biggest single change we made since our daughters were born .
you had blogs pop up , and some manuals were written .
and suddenly the most amazing things started coming out of our daughters ' mouths .
the word " agile " entered the lexicon in 2001 when jeff sutherland and a group of designers met in utah and wrote a 12-point agile manifesto .
we 'll have family breakfast . we 'll meet for a bedtime snack .
there 's a reason that few systems have been more waterfall over time than the family .
and by the way , research backs this up too .
and we ended up with 10 statements .
so my final plank is , tell your story .
it 's a matter of choice .
if you 're a mom trying to manage a budget , and oil was 150 dollars a barrel last summer , and it 's somewhere between 50 and 70 , do you plan vacations ? how do you buy ?
but if you stack it up , you just see this amazing , staggering amount of dollars that have been put into the system to fund and bail us out .
and so there is an increase in people having to have their fillings replaced .
first things is we see something must be happening when p. diddy vows to tone down his bling .
again , this theme is about variable cost , variable living .
gore-tex is all about personal accountability of their management and their employees , to the point where they really kind of shun the idea of bosses .
and then we look at the high line in new york city , an excellent use of reimagining existing infrastructure for something good , which is a brand new park in new york city .
realizing that it 's difficult to get loans in this environment , you 're doing business with people you trust , in your local markets .
then you look at the phenomenon of kogi .
thank you very much .
but at the age of 14 , a friend of mine got me interested in comic books , and i decided that was what i wanted to do for a living .
hardly anybody listened to him in his day .
and it probably applies just as much to music and to movies and to fine art , which has nothing whatsoever to do with vision at all , or for that matter , nothing to do with our conference theme of " inspired by nature " -- except to the extent of the fable of the frog who gives the ride to the scorpion on his back to get across the river because the scorpion promises not to sting him , but then the scorpion does sting him anyway and they both die , but not before the frog asks him why and the scorpion says , " because it 's my nature " -- in that sense , yes .
what 's interesting is , once you hit print -- and this is from 1450 , by the way -- all of the artifacts of modern comics start to present themselves : rectilinear panel arrangements , simple line drawings without tone and a left-to-right reading sequence .
and i thought , o.k. , well , if that 's true , is there any way , when we go beyond today 's print , to somehow bring that back ?
here 's another one i 'll show you . this is by drew weing ; this is called , " pup contemplates the heat death of the universe . "
if you 're a veteran coming back from iraq or vietnam you face a blizzard of paperwork to get your benefits ; if you 're trying to get a small business loan , you face a blizzard of paperwork .
it 's a grid , it 's a calendar .
i thank you .
by the way , the wages for librarians went up faster than the wages for other jobs in the u.s. over that same time period , because librarians became partners of computers .
in fact , robots have become sort of ubiquitous in our lives in many ways .
here chris took the object out of its hand , and baxter didn 't go and try to put it down ; it went back and realized it had to get another one .
these robots we 're shipping every day .
that 's climate change and demographics .
and that we will all come to rely on robots over the next 40 years as part of our everyday lives .
i have gone on to find more things and discover that dinosaurs really were very social .
and then , then , then , and then ...
so a few years went by , and then we started the hell creek project .
it was extraordinary .
avian dinosaurs are our modern birds .
or any of the other funny-looking little dogs .
now that 's a good characteristic .
we want to stop that gene from turning on , fusing those hands together , so we can get a chicken that hatches out with a three-fingered hand , like the archaeopteryx .
today 's its debut .
without this ability there is no magic .
but when the scenario we have imagined suddenly flips into something entirely unexpected , we laugh .
they give us our identity and a sense of community .
now i was stupid , but not so stupid that i turned it down .
the dietrich book was an observation by her daughter ; it was a biography .
i miss michael .
hello !
all of these solutions derive their origins from the text of the book , but once the book designer has read the text , then he has to be an interpreter and a translator .
all those years , all those books , he never got tired of it .
so that 's my story . to be continued .
design -- i love its design .
at first i thought i was just going to be here to perform , but unexpectedly , i learned and enjoyed much more .
because , when people heard that my son was a victim , i got immediate sympathy .
i don 't know if he 's alive . i don 't know if he 's tortured .
i know what it is to suffer , and i feel that if there is a crime , a person should be tried fairly and punished . "
i knew that eating a mere hamburger a day can increase my risk of dying by a third .
the name says it all : nothing with a face monday through friday .
what i thought about was , what caused the diabetes ?
it turns out that one of the best ways to look at microbes and to understand them is to look at their dna .
so they actually switched to leaving some of the microbial community in the ileum . they leave the microbes with the donor , and theoretically that might help the people who are receiving this ileal transplant .
but probiotics are sort of a very , very simple solution .
and i was getting up every five minutes to pee , and drinking everybody 's water at the table , and i think they all thought i was a druggie .
and this is this voracious predator launching a sneak attack on this poor little unsuspecting jellyfish there , a by-the-wind sailor .
you know , if you give mother nature enough time , that is what she will produce .
so we 've got to figure out how they 're living their lives .
and we 're interested in how these animals are using the currents , using temperature , using the open ocean , to live their lives .
and they 're not thrown back as by-catch , they 're eaten .
and this is a day in the life of a mola , and if we -- they 're up and down , and up and down , and up and down , and up and up and down , up to 40 times a day .
if it 's helping to unite the world , i think it 's definitely the fish of the future .
and a big part of the work that is sort of absent in this context is text .
this is the exhibited art on the walls of the cia in langley , virginia , their original headquarters building .
and the film was shot on 72 millimeter , government-issue film .
it 's supposed to be a generic site of worship .
a woman was raped and presented with a series of photographs from which to identify her attacker .
he ended up serving 18 and a half years of an 80 year sentence for rape and robbery .
at every stage of our lives we make decisions that will profoundly influence the lives of the people we 're going to become , and then when we become those people , we 're not always thrilled with the decisions we made .
here 's what we found .
bring to mind right now for yourself your favorite musician today and your favorite musician 10 years ago .
thank you .
they receive input from thousands of upstream partners and compute their own electrical outputs , which then , if they pass a certain threshold , will go to thousands of downstream partners .
so again , we 're sent back to the idea of ultra-precise control .
so what we need to do is to take these molecules and somehow install them in neurons .
one of the questions we 've confronted is , what are the signals in the brain that mediate the sensation of reward ?
the shock isn 't painful , but it 's a little annoying .
and we found all sorts of molecules , they 're called halorhodopsins or archaerhodopsins , that respond to green and yellow light .
so it 's early days , to be upfront , but we 're excited about it .
so he 's not using vision to do it .
right , yeah .
and that 's me in the background , carving around the whole formation in freefall also , with the helmet cam to film this jump .
so with all this knowledge , i also wanted to get into stunts .
ueli gegenschatz : pretty much . i believe this is probably the closest possibility to come to the dream of being able to fly .
ue : the purest and the best feeling would be with only goggles .
they all come from homes where there is , for the most part , just one person in the home , usually the mother or the grandmother , and that 's it , and they come here for their education and for their structure .
try it with your kids . see if it works .
but you 'd be amazed at what you can do with them once you put them in that structure .
that 's when you start to imprint on the child that " you are special , you are different from every other child in the world .
i have my entire new york city board of education transcript from kindergarten through college .
so they shipped me off to the army , and lo and behold , many years later , i 'm considered one of the greatest sons the city college of new york has ever had .
they never went to the bathroom . they never cooked .
we touch every nation . every nation touches us .
" yes , yes . " " oh ... " i hand him the money .
but it hurt , because it made me fear that i was somehow doing something un-joblike and unfair , shameful .
and i lay there thinking , these people have so little .
we signed with a major label .
it 's about 25,000 people .
for most of human history , musicians , artists , they 've been part of the community , connectors and openers , not untouchable stars .
and if you look back about the forecasts on surveillance by george orwell , well it turns out that george orwell was an optimist .
right ?
so that 's basically perfectly safe , uncrackable .
that would explain it . they aren 't cooperating . they 've been hacked .
and the answer is , every single swedish business leader does that every single day .
and the same thing with the bill of rights and all the amendments and the universal declaration of human rights and the e.u. conventions on human rights and fundamental freedoms and the press freedom ?
we are more honest with search engines than we are with our families .
and that 's much easier said than done .
and from these early experiences as a child i learned to love landscapes .
so , it was in the course of these investigations that i ran into a map .
so i saw this remarkable map in a book .
and we might think of these as abandoned .
and rapidly we started to realize that beavers can be something that a bobcat needs .
so if we wanted to go between 85th and 86th , and lex and third , maybe there was a stream in that block .
so we can see the collect pond , and lispenard marshes back behind .
or if we imagine the new york city metropolitan area , currently home to 12 million people , but 12 million people in the future , perhaps living at the density of manhattan , in only 36 percent of the area , with the areas in between covered by farmland , covered by wetlands , covered by the marshes we need .
she goes back to reading her book , which is unfortunately titled " rape . "
so that 's a still from the video there .
we didn 't let the stores know we were coming .
this is the best buy in new york city .
ultimately , the police had to inform best buy management that it was not , in fact , illegal to wear a blue polo shirt and khaki pants .
and that was done also without permission , although no one seemed to care .
i still paint . i love art .
and when colors came out everywhere , a mood of change started transforming the spirit of people .
crime did fall .
we built the bright new reception hall that made people , tirana citizens , think they had traveled abroad when they entered to make their requests .
our world is defined by the pace of change .
but for the desert society this is no program ; this is their life .
and people made their house , and the water storage tanks .
and this is what they call zero b type of water , because it comes from the clouds , pure distilled water .
i 'm not sure by that time bombay was there , or delhi was there , or chennai was there , or bangalore was there .
everybody in the town will know that this elephant has drowned , so water will be there for seven months or nine months , or 12 months .
this is the same dry water body .
excuse me , who built these structures ?
and these are the flowers which add fragrance to our lives .
i mean , it 's just a losing proposition .
david milch , creator of " deadwood " and other amazing tv shows , has a really good description for this .
here 's a really cool problem . i like this .
do you guys see how this , right here , compared to that -- which one creates that patient problem solving , that math reasoning ?
and then even better is we take a video , a video of someone filling it up .
this has been a lot of fun .
i could show the world how to smile , i could be glad all of the while . i could turn the gray skies to blue , if i had you . i could leave the old days behind , leave all my pals , i 'd never mind . i could start my life all anew , if i had you . i could climb the snow-capped mountains , sail the mighty ocean wide . i could cross the burning desert , if i had you by my side . i could be a king , dear , uncrowned , humble or poor , rich or renowned . there is nothing i couldn 't do , if i had you . thank you . well , thank you so much .
we all hope it might be something green , or all of this nanotech stuff , and in order for that stuff to happen , " they say -- this was a special issue on the next industrial revolution -- they say , " the state , just stick to the basics , right ?
so the pharmaceutical industry , which i am personally very interested in because i 've actually had the fortune to study it in quite some depth , is wonderful to be asking this question about the revolutionary versus non-revolutionary bits , because each and every medicine can actually be divided up on whether it really is revolutionary or incremental .
but the narrative that we 've always been told is the state is important for the basics , but not really providing that sort of high-risk , revolutionary thinking out of the box .
and this brings me , actually , probably , to the biggest implication , and this has huge implications beyond innovation .
this , by the way , in the countries that are actually thinking about this strategically , countries like finland in scandinavia , but also in china and brazil , they 're retaining equity in these investments .
what is this ?
well , the short answer is , we locked up all the japanese during world war ii , including those that made fortune cookies , so that 's the time when the chinese moved in , kind of saw a market opportunity and took over .
and -- -- i actually found a whole bunch of general tso 's relatives who are still in the little town .
now back then , the americans were not clamoring to eat chinese food .
in fact , if you think about it , chinese food is the most pervasive food on the planet , served on all seven continents , even antarctica , because monday night is chinese food night at mcmurdo station , which is the main scientific station in antarctica .
chinese restaurants have done largely the same thing , i would argue , with the menu and the décor -- even the restaurant name -- but without a centralized headquarters .
so it 's kind of part of the phenomenon i called spontaneous self-organization , right , where , like in ant colonies , where little decisions made by -- on the micro-level actually have a big impact on the macro-level .
daffodil hudson : hello ?
so we 've been planting stuff for 11,000 years . and in the measure that we plant stuff , what we learn from agriculture is you 've got to deal with pests , you 've got to deal with all types of awful things , you 've got to cultivate stuff . in the measure that you learn how to use water to cultivate , then you 're going to be able to spread beyond the nile .
these are the athabasca tar sands , and there 's an enormous amount -- first of mining , the largest trucks in the world are working here , and then you 've got to pull out this black sludge , which is basically oil that doesn 't flow . it 's tied to the sand . and then you 've got to use a lot of steam to separate it , which only works at today 's oil prices .
this is what accumulates in the tar sands of alberta . these are sulfur blocks . because as you separate that petroleum from the sand , and use an enormous amount of energy inside that vapor -- steam to separate this stuff -- you also have to separate out the sulfur . the difference between light crude and heavy crude -- well , it 's about 14 bucks a barrel . that 's why you 're building these pyramids of sulfur blocks . and by the way , the scale on these things is pretty large .
and it 's important to remember that , because the bonobos are so human , and they share 99 percent of their genes with us .
and here 's a very special moment , when my mother and myself were digging up some remains of human ancestors .
and here is a skull of a homo erectus , which i just pulled off the shelf there .
well , an excavation was begun immediately , and more and more little bits of skull started to be extracted from the sediment .
and what is it that really makes us us ?
evolutionarily speaking , we 're just a blip .
i would bring the branches home , riding buses and subways , barely holding them in my hands .
thanks to my ancestors for robbing me of my invention .
you know , in a dictionary ? yeah , that 's what i thought .
and it 's not very fun . and when parts of your job are not easy or fun , you kind of look for an excuse not to do them .
i mean , i 'm a huge geek , i love computers .
and when you improve searchability , you actually take away the one advantage of print , which is serendipity .
how can this be ? i mean , i love books . i really love books .
and so people say to me , " how do i know if a word is real ? "
and i 'm not even talking about polysemy , which is the greedy habit some words have of taking more than one meaning for themselves .
but even if it were , rocket science is being done by dedicated amateurs these days . you know ?
they show the word , but they don 't show any context .
this is what dictionaries used to look like .
or , what if you could give genetic information to a battery so that it could actually become better as a function of time , and do so in an environmentally friendly way ?
so nature already gives us really exquisite structures on the nanoscale .
and i was really fortunate to have president obama visit my lab this year on his visit to mit , and i really wanted to give him a periodic table .
and through a process of selection evolution , you can pull one out of a billion that does something that you 'd like it to do , like grow a battery or grow a solar cell .
and what we 've been able to do is engineer a virus to basically take dye-absorbing molecules and line them up on the surface of the virus so it acts as an antenna , and you get an energy transfer across the virus .
so the plane landed in between the buildings and got to a full stop in front of this little billboard .
so you could drive up into the mountains freely blasting the police on the new sony walkman .
and , lastly , under " harmony , " they had this 13th-century mandala from tibet .
so you 're you 're really bored in the subway , and you kind of stare at something .
and other people go and fill them in .
a couple of weeks ago , a french company asked us to design five billboards for them .
it 's a competition we 're holding , the second x prize , for the first team to sequence 100 human genomes in 10 days .
well , we asked him why he wanted to go up and do this .
and a seventh and an eighth .
i think that 's a question we haven 't really answered yet , but i think something that has the potential to be an answer is that maybe happiness has an awful lot to do with the contents of our moment-to-moment experiences .
well , since i 'm a scientist , i 'd like to try to resolve this debate with some data , and in particular i 'd like to present some data to you from three questions that i ask with track your happiness . remember , this is from sort of moment-to-moment experience in people 's real lives .
as it turns out , there is a strong relationship between mind-wandering now and being unhappy a short time later , consistent with the idea that mind-wandering is causing people to be unhappy .
when i was looking at these pictures , it brought me back many years to my past when i was a child .
that second he declared this child dead .
the next day , while i was listening to the scanners , i heard about a call coming in of a 70-year-old man hurt by a car only one block away from me on the main street of my neighborhood .
we 're just there to get the gap between the ambulance call until they arrive .
arabs were saving jews . jews were saving arabs .
you even saw these volunteers in new york saving lives in the world trade center .
there are just way too few eye care professionals .
i started working on it in 1985 , and it 's been evolving very slowly .
take a look at this drawing .
because creating movies of processes as we think they actually occur is really hard .
when i travel with my work across europe and the united states , one question always comes up : where is the palestinian gandhi ?
but i think the girls could do it .
the resistance in budrus has since spread to villages across the west bank and to palestinian neighborhoods in jerusalem .
on the israeli side , there is a new peace movement called solidariot , which means solidarity in hebrew .
that the success of sliced bread , like the success of almost everything we 've been talking about at this conference , is not always about what the patent is like , or what the factory is like -- it 's about can you get your idea to spread , or not .
that just over the last few years , what anybody who markets anything has discovered is that it 's not working the way that it used to .
i don 't want to get email from anybody ; i want to get " memail . "
because it 's new , because it 's fresh .
that 's what mass marketing is .
krispy kreme has a strategy , and what they do is , they enter a city , they talk to the people with otaku , and then they spread through the city to the people who 've just crossed the street .
and this picture frame has a cord going out the back , and you plug it into the wall .
it doesn 't matter whether you 're making a record album , or you 're an architect , or you have a tract on sociology .
and people used to come from miles around to swim in the lake .
this bottle of oil , distilled over a hundred million years of geological time , ancient sunlight , contains the energy equivalent of about five weeks hard human manual labor -- equivalent to about 35 strong people coming round and working for you .
there is also the issue of climate change , is the other thing that underpins this transition approach .
and i would argue that there are four . there is the idea of business as usual , that the future will be like the present , just more of it .
it 's self-organizing . there is no great central organization that pushes this ; people just pick up an idea and they run with it , and they implement it where they are .
there was a degree of resilience , if you like , at that time , which we can now only look back on with envy .
a lot of places are working with their local schools .
and we see it all over the place as well now .
this is actually a direct quote from an epidemiologist who 's been in field of hiv for 15 years , worked on four continents , and you 're looking at her .
and if there 's one place you really want to get high , it 's when you 're in jail .
and that changes the equation slightly , doesn 't it ?
so what we 've been doing in the united states is reviewing the data -- endlessly reviewing the data .
i 've always been a bit curious about that because i think stigma is a bad thing , whereas lots of sex is quite a good thing , but we 'll leave that be .
this , for example , this gentleman is called joseph .
aids was a disfiguring disease that killed you , and hiv is an invisible virus that makes you take a pill every day .
why does she do that job ?
and everyone who 's in this room , and everyone who 's watching this out there on the web , i think , has a duty to demand of their politicians that we make policy based on scientific evidence and on common sense .
and then there 's finally -- there 's the affordability question .
and the market research , consumer research , asking the boomers and gen y what it is they would like , what they would like to live in , tells us there is going to be a huge demand -- and we 're already seeing it -- for more urban lifestyles within suburbia .
in addition to , i think , doing a beautiful adaptive reuse , they tore up some of the parking spaces , put in bioswales to collect and clean the runoff , put in a lot more sidewalks to connect to the neighborhoods .
here is the site in 1940 : it was just a little farm in the village of hyattsville .
but the one story stuff ...
but densification is not going to work everywhere .
these slides just show two images from a larger project that looked at trying to do that for atlanta .
the final challenge is for all of you .
there are 1.4 million pregnant women in low- and middle-income countries living with hiv and of these , 90 percent are in sub-saharan africa .
it means 1,100 children infected each day -- 1,100 children each day , infected with hiv .
this is a picture of a maternal health clinic in africa -- mothers coming , pregnant and with their babies .
the door opens and there 's a room full of mothers , mothers with babies , and they 're sitting , and they 're talking , they 're listening .
they 're hired -- they 're paid as professional members of the health care teams , just like doctors and nurses .
and this is so important in breaking through the stigma .
i 'm hiv-positive .
how do you build a better health care system ?
i started the program in capetown , south africa back in 2001 .
i bought some pigs . i was living in sussex .
but that black line shows what a food supply should be in a country if they allow for a good , stable , secure , nutritional diet for every person in that country .
that 's what 's in fields around the world every single year .
so i kept on thinking , where do those crusts go ?
i thought , " my god , you know , i go around the world telling people to stop wasting food .
if we did that , and fed it to pigs , we would save that amount of carbon .
why ? because they were old and infirm , and we needed to go by to see if they needed anything .
this is when we can just be who we are , and now we have this stuffy brother with his shirt and tie on , while we are still in our pjs .
arm in arm for struggle .
one more picture while i 'm stinking and thinking about the riverside church : 9 / 11 . last night at chagrin fall , a newspaperman and a television guy said , " that evening , when a service was held at the riverside church , we carried it on our station in this city .
this always seemed to me to be a deepening of the sense of what it means to be a good samaritan .
and so i want to close with a little song .
disrespect , boredom , too much time on facebook , having sex with other people .
instead of pointing out her husband 's growing gut or suggesting he go for a run , she might say , " wow , honey , thank you for going out of your way to make me relatively thinner . "
i 'm serious .
we produce happier , more stable and more successful kids .
in each country , i 'm sure you have this thing called the parent-teacher conference .
and the floppy disk drive person wears it .
we 're kind of stuck in a loop , perhaps , and this sense of possibility from computing is something i 've been questioning for the last 10 or so years , and have looked to design , as we understand most things , and to understand design with our technology has been a passion of mine .
if you just change one letter in that content , you get a much better word , much better content : free .
and then i spent a lot of time in the space of interactive graphics and things like this , and i stopped doing it because my students at mit got so much better than myself , so i had to hang up my mouse .
it 's like , art is supposed to be enigmatic , so when you say , like , " i don 't get it , " like , oh , that 's great .
you see it in all interesting art today , in all interesting businesses today . how we combine those two together to make good is very interesting .
and i had a show in london recently where my friends invited me to come to london for four days to sit in a sandbox , and i said great .
leaders might be able to use these systems to better regulate how they work inside the heterarchy .
i think we have a problem in mexico .
hold on ! wait a minute !
many people in mexico are afraid today .
unfortunately , violent action -- though action is better than no action -- but taking part in it only disguises violence .
and for over a year he has known that a price has been put on his head .
what are we going to do ?
they took my name tag , but i wanted to ask you , did anyone here write their name on the tag in arabic ?
where could this happen ?
how ?
so , in order for them to innovate and produce , they had to protect their language .
does she want to commit suicide ?
you 've seen an example of it outside , a scene of a letter surrounded by black and yellow tape with " don 't kill your language ! " written on it .
a single novel could make us global again .
let 's get rid of this cultural cringe .
so therefore , if i translate this piece of music , we have this idea .
and i just feel , at last , one with the stick and one with the drum .
they 're all different .
every single one of us , depending on where we 're sitting , will experience this sound quite , quite differently .
and this is quite interesting .
and please try to create that through your clapping . try . just -- please try .
so , heavens ! what was i to do ? i no longer required the sticks ; i wasn 't allowed to have these sticks .
i need to have the reason , and the reason has to be by saying something through the music . "
now , when we first started talking to ok go -- the name of the song is " this too shall pass " -- we were really excited because they expressed interest in building a machine that they could dance with .
so we have this 10,000-square-foot warehouse we were using , divided between two floors .
and we lost one high-heeled shoe when one of our engineers , heather knight , left her high-heeled shoe -- after a nice dinner , and returned back to the build -- and left it in a pile of stuff .
again , small to large is relevant here .
we need some more ridiculous things besides " the cabinet of natural curiosities . "
our instrument took this image of the veil of venus , which turned out to be a smog of sulfuric acid .
but energy policies continued to focus on finding more fossil fuels .
the biggest reservoir , the ocean , was the least well measured , until more than 3,000 argo floats were distributed around the world 's ocean .
but that lag is exactly what is expected .
the important point is that we will have started a process that is out of humanity 's control .
this fee and dividend would stimulate the economy and innovations , creating millions of jobs .
the science is clear .
what had changed to make a new name necessary precisely at that moment ?
the members of the philosophical breakfast club disagreed .
later , babbage 's analytical engine was the first mechanical computer in the modern sense .
they did not foresee at least one consequence of their revolution .
they don 't have a bucket or a box .
it 's a very potent weapon of mass destruction .
and i think that the real waste of human waste is that we are wasting it as a resource and as an incredible trigger for development , because these are a few things that toilets and poop itself can do for us .
it 's like the new sperm donor .
she grew up in a rural village in a poor area of india , and she was engaged at 14 , and then at 21 or so , she moved into her in-law 's house .
her entire life , she 'd been using the banana field behind , but she installed the latrine in a few hours .
thank you .
the garage on the right -- the gray structure -- will be torn down , finally , and several small classrooms will be placed along this avenue that we 've created , this campus .
and then , i sliced off the head and the tail and everything and tried to translate what i was learning about the form of the fish and the movement .
couldn 't find it .
and he didn 't buy a sculpture , so i made one .
people hate it .
and it was this interaction between that kind of , up-the-ante stuff that became pretty interesting .
i used the galvanize and copper in a very light gauge , so it would buckle .
and he put these two bridges with pink guardrails on it .
that solid wall behind it is a pipe chase -- a pipe canyon -- and so it was an opportunity that i seized , because i didn 't have to have any protruding ducts or vents or things in this form .
etc. etc .
we collaborated with oldenburg and put the newspaper on top , folded .
i 've offered to marry her so i could sleep there , but she said i didn 't have to do that .
and so it was an intent to make this small piece of land -- it 's 100 by 250 -- into a kind of an estate by separating these areas and making the living room and dining room into this pavilion with a high space in it .
palais des sports , the gare de lyon over here .
and the idea was to make this express the energy of this .
you come into the magic kingdom and the hotel that tony baxter 's group is doing out here .
this is the disney hall -- the concert hall .
and we tried many shapes , trying to get the energy of the original design within an acoustical , acceptable format .
and i was asked to do a fish , and so i did a snake .
it 's amazing , when you meet a head of state and you say , " what is your most precious natural resource ? " -- they will not say children at first .
interestingly enough , in other countries , it will be the minister of finance who sees it as an engine of economic growth .
so we 're once again doing " give one , get one . "
or in arizona , which is john mccain 's home , obama didn 't have much improvement .
in deciding your vote for president today , was the race of the candidate a factor ?
and there are a couple of these that have strong predictive relationships , one of which is education , where you see the states with the fewest years of schooling per adult are in red , and you see this part of the country , the kind of appalachians region , is less educated . it 's just a fact .
but you see democrats versus republican , not a big difference based on who your neighbors are .
this is the neighborhood where i grew up in east lansing , michigan .
an account that explains the presence of beauty in everything on this list is not going to be easy .
and it should take into account what we know of the aesthetic interests of isolated hunter-gatherer bands that survived into the 19th and the 20th centuries .
it would hardly do to eat your baby or your lover .
i have in mind the so-called acheulian hand axes .
by the end of the hand axe epic , homo sapiens -- as they were then called , finally -- were doubtless finding new ways to amuse and amaze each other by , who knows , telling jokes , storytelling , dancing , or hairstyling .
one is called the general election .
and here 's the key : there are just as few relevant funders in usa-land as there are lesters in lesterland .
we have lesters from everywhere . we could think , " what could we do to make lesterland better ? "
when al gore was vice president , his team had an idea for deregulating a significant portion of the telecommunications industry .
but we cannot ignore this corruption anymore .
fifty percent of the senate between 1998 and 2004 left to become lobbyists , 42 percent of the house .
when she said that , i scrambled .
we have lost that republic .
and we can see places where stars are forming , like the eagle nebula . we see stars dying .
the everyday world is determined by atoms , how they stick together to make molecules .
we depend on stars to make the atoms we 're made of .
but they will have a dark side .
and i think to harness science optimally , to choose which doors to open and which to leave closed , we need latter-day counterparts of people like joseph rothblatt .
over nearly all that immense time , earth 's appearance would have changed very gradually .
or will some of the metallic objects launched from the earth spawn new oases , a post-human life elsewhere ?
so if you look right there , it finds that little bacterium , and it engulfs it and eats it .
i want to talk about something really ordinary , just ordinary sand .
there 's some sand that 's really much more colorful .
and you can see here that that is -- that 's sort of vaporized , and that material is holding this little clump of little sand grains together .
but i would come back from those dives and try to share the experience with words , and they were totally inadequate to the task .
it 's what 's known as a bioluminescent burglar alarm , and just like the alarm on your car or your house , it 's meant to cast unwanted attention onto the intruder , thereby either leading to his capture or scaring him away .
it 's phenomenal .
and there are brittle stars that produce bands of light that dance along their arms .
so i just want to show you some of the responses we 've elicited from animals in the deep sea .
and it is an optical cue that there 's carrion on the bottom of the ocean .
nope .
that adds up to an annual death toll of greater than the population of canada .
and i wish godspeed to aubrey de grey , and other people like him , to try to do something about this as soon as possible .
so if you take into account future generations as much as our own , every other moral imperative of philanthropic cost just becomes irrelevant .
we were very successful .
as far as i can see , all of you are users of this enhancement technology in this room , so that 's a great thing .
if you think about what we normally take as giving life a lot of its meaning -- music , humor , eroticism , spirituality , aesthetics , nurturing and caring , gossip , chatting with people -- all of these , very likely , are enabled by a special circuitry that we humans have , but that you could have another intelligent life form that lacks these .
you can engineer a prairie vole to become monogamous when it 's naturally polygamous .
so every year , june 16 , we will commemorate all those comrades or students who died .
fifty percent of crashes happen at intersections .
that 's just the gasoline cost . there is also pollution , wear on the car , and time .
you couldn 't suddenly tell everyone , " ok , remember what you used to do at yield signs ? now do something different . "
the political fight that we 've developed has become one around whether it 's the government that 's the problem or is it insurance companies that are the problem .
you set the fracture , you drew the blood , you spun the blood , looked at it under the microscope , you plated the culture , you injected the antiserum .
everyone just has a piece of the care .
but when we look at the positive deviants -- the ones who are getting the best results at the lowest costs -- we find the ones that look the most like systems are the most successful .
it took him three months .
you have to think about things like pause points .
just using a checklist requires you to embrace different values from the ones we 've had , like humility , discipline , teamwork .
booted up in a cell , the program would execute , and it could result in this person ; or with a small change , it could result in this person ; or another small change , this person ; or with a larger change , this dog , or this tree , or this whale .
my little group of molecular programmers are trying to refashion all of these parts from dna .
and just as he 's writing , you know , bacteria that will be smaller , he 's writing genomes that will work , we could write smaller programs that would do what microsoft word does .
you can look in this computer-fabricated artifact , and he 's got a double-stranded genome -- that 's no good .
i ordered them ; they came by fedex .
let the thing assemble , and you 'll get some kind of a circuit .
you zoom in , there are just four dna strands and they have little single-stranded bits on them that can bind to other tiles , if they match .
and the neat thing about it is , is that it 's also reprogrammable .
and you can see how they count .
i was lucky enough to be completely ignored , which is a fabulous thing , actually , i want to tell you .
and some of the watches there , attempting to be beautiful and humorous -- maybe not attempting , hopefully succeeding .
this is andrew gatz , and he walked in through the door and i said , " you ! sit down there . " you know , i take lots of photos .
who are these people ? what are these tribes ?
and , " he noticed a large stain in the center of the rug . "
i happen to know it for a fact .
but actually , it 's not . it 's actually a wonderful thing .
so now , my friends , if that is true , and it is true , what is the point ? "
and i went to visit louise bourgeoise , who 's also still working , and i looked at her sink , which is really amazing , and left .
well , here is an image of a particular galaxy cluster .
third thing : probing the very small .
okay , if there 's anything stranger i think it has to be dark energy .
today , we as a society are faced with many , many difficult problems .
and i started having these bizarre dinner parties at my house on friday nights where people would come over and we would do dna extractions , and i would actually capture them on video , because it created this kind of funny portrait as well .
here it is .
now , we did what we knew , how we had grown up , and one of the things that we knew , that was in our dna , was secrecy .
" you can just declassify them . "
hw : thank you so much . thank you .
it was actually interesting that such a communist principle was the basis of a system developed during the cold war by the defense department , but it obviously worked really well , and we all saw what happened with the internet .
that will not succeed .
when you pump gas , you really don 't think you 're using the internet .
this doesn 't need to be a multi-billion-dollar government project .
if you go to an amusement park and don 't want to stand in the long lines for the popular rides , there is now a solution .
the more things money can buy , the more affluence , or the lack of it , matters .
first , how many think it might at least be worth a try to see if it would work ? raise your hand .
all right . what 's emerged from this discussion is the following question : will the cash incentive drive out or corrupt or crowd out the higher motivation , the intrinsic lesson that we hope to convey , which is to learn to love to learn and to read for their own sakes ?
for fear of disagreement , we shrink from these questions .
much of the deception is everyday . in fact , a lot of research shows that we all lie once or twice a day , as dave suggested .
they 're called the butler , the sock puppet and the chinese water army .
here 's one of his bestselling books .
and it really throws people for a loop because we think , well , there 's no nonverbal cues , so why don 't you lie more ?
along the y-axis , the vertical axis , is how tall they actually were .
the eyes do not tell us whether somebody 's lying or not .
well , as a social scientist , this is the most amazing thing i have ever even dreamed of . now , i can look at all those words that used to , for millennia , disappear .
let me highlight a couple of things here in the fake review . the first is that liars tend to think about narrative . they make up a story : who ? and what happened ? and that 's what happened here .
now , when you are about to say or do something , we can think , do i want this to be part of my legacy , part of my personal record ?
and so we took a step back and we said , " what is it that we are trying to achieve ? "
so going the hospital is a lottery .
continuous improvement .
they were always best in class .
in three years ' time , we plan to have covered 40 percent of the disease burden .
so i want to try and convince you in about 15 minutes that that 's a ridiculous and ludicrous thing to do .
it 's of the moon enceladus .
but that 's not the prime candidate for life in the solar system .
because , for the first time , we saw our world , not as a solid , immovable , kind of indestructible place , but as a very small , fragile-looking world just hanging against the blackness of space .
this is actually a picture of the spectrum of the sun .
it 's just one of billions of galaxies in the universe .
and they certainly didn 't intend to describe the mechanics of supernova explosions , which eventually told us where the building blocks of life were synthesized in the universe .
and after it visited all four of those planets , carl sagan , who 's one of my great heroes , had the wonderful idea of turning voyager around and taking a picture of every planet it had visited .
he was clearly under assault all the time .
so let 's envision what the system might look like .
the laboratory that we set up in santa cruz was our skunkworks .
i mentioned we looked at birds and marine mammals and looked at basically the environmental impact of the system , and finally we looked at the economics , and what i mean by economics is , what is the energy required to run the system ?
there 's lots of possibilities .
i 'm here to give you your recommended dietary allowance of poetry .
and my sense is , it 's a good thing to get poetry off the shelves and more into public life .
narration : " some days . "
i lived in new york city .
the dead are always looking down on us , they say .
but then she was beheaded , so never mind her as a role model .
now black holes are dark against a dark sky .
and he was reading einstein 's recently published general theory of relativity , and he was thrilled by this theory .
but basically that 's what we 're talking about .
imagine now taking an astrophysically realistic situation -- imagine two black holes that have lived a long life together .
the sound you 're hearing is the light black hole banging on space each time it gets close .
now that 's our prediction for what we 'll see .
this animation from my friends at proton studios shows looking at the big bang from the outside .
so within the next few years , we 'll be able to turn up the soundtrack a little bit , render the universe in audio .
and it finally happened , so ...
so on the week of my 30th birthday , i decided i was going to go to this local open mic , and put this fear behind me .
but that was my first real experience as a solo singer-songwriter .
would it be okay if i played the stage fright song for you ?
and we know that from spain , we know that " sol y sombra . "
we need , for instance , to bring in radiant cooling technology , and we need to combine this with so-called soft conditioning .
so this -- thank you very much .
it 's trying to perceive images into objects rather than seeing what 's there . "
so one of the things that goes from simple to complex is when we do more . we like more .
and this kind of proof is the kind of proof that you need to learn when you 're learning mathematics in order to get an idea of what it means before you look into the , literally , 1,200 or 1,500 proofs of pythagoras ' theorem that have been discovered .
well , that 's pretty amazing .
you know how much trouble the children have with variables , but by learning it this way , in a situated fashion , they never forget from this single trial what a variable is and how to use it .
ak : so obviously , aristotle never asked a child about this particular point because , of course , he didn 't bother doing the experiment , and neither did st. thomas aquinas .
i guess the best way to end this is with two quotes : marshall mcluhan said , " children are the messages that we send to the future , " but in fact , if you think of it , children are the future we send to the future .
one fifth of all living mammals is a bat , and they have very unique attributes .
they do not perceive their environment using sound , and these are the flying foxes .
but most bats are voracious insect predators .
well , i believe we just look at nature 's experiments .
well , really , this is a picture drawn from the 1500s of the fountain of youth . aging is considered one of the most familiar , yet the least well-understood , aspects of all of biology , and really , since the dawn of civilization , mankind has sought to avoid it .
aging is a big problem for humanity , and i believe that by studying bats , we can uncover the molecular mechanisms that enable mammals to achieve extraordinary longevity . if we find out what they 're doing , perhaps through gene therapy , we can enable us to do the same thing .
and a message saying , " hey , it 's me . i miss you .
we can interfere with the interface .
because my physicians constantly ask me questions about this .
i don 't know if anybody might hail from northeastern pennsylvania , but this is where i spent my first 19 years with my little young lungs .
they haven 't asked me what kind of the quality of the drinking water that i put in my mouth or the food that i ingest into my stomach .
anybody got any clues ? ski . right .
i could have made the decision , if i had this information , not to move to the ozone capital of the united states , couldn 't i ? i could make that decision .
because , as we all know here today , it doesn 't work very well .
these stories of his life , converted to data .
it 's two years of this disease . all of the symptoms are not there .
i 'm going to log in .
i want my brother 's center of the universe and his symptoms and his drugs , and all of the things that interact among those , the side effects , to be in this beautiful data galaxy that we can look at in any way we want to understand it , so that we can take this information and go beyond just this simple model of what a record is .
this is a report about a drug called lithium .
you don 't have the blinding , you don 't have data , it doesn 't follow the scientific method .
but we could see whether it was going to work for humberto .
and i put 100 million cells in his cisterna magna , in his lumbar cord , and filled out the irbs and did all this work , and i never really knew .
and i am thankful .
all right , this first song you 're going to hear is " nottamun town . " it 's a traditional folk tune .
instead , these laws and laws around the world use the rather awkward analogy of property .
it 's the small parts of it that are , and it 's in these small details where we can clearly see patent law contradicting its intent : to promote the progress of useful arts .
so here 's the sort of equation we 're looking at .
i had zero minutes of exercise yesterday , so my maximum heart rate during exercise wasn 't calculated .
and nike knows how to get your pace and distance from just that sensor .
the self is just our operation center , our consciousness , our moral compass .
and at that time , i was not thinking about changing the world .
everyone was glued to the tv , watching disturbing , frightening images taken from the edge of the neighborhood .
i mean , at that time , trust me , they were only referring to the israeli and palestinian conflict .
so he went to the church of nativity and brought back an old ladder that was so old that it could have seen jesus being born .
face 2 face demonstrated that what we thought impossible was possible -- and , you know what , even easy .
so i decided to go there .
what i want to show is the incredible life and energy .
are you an ngo ? are you the media ? "
and i went there a few months ago -- photos are still there -- and it was missing a piece of the eye .
each project -- that 's a film from women are heroes .
i think , today , as important as the result is the way you do things .
it doesn 't matter today if it 's your photo or not .
take the photos , the portraits , upload it -- i 'll give you all the details -- and i 'll send you back your poster . join by groups and reveal things to the world .
and i use a heat mat to sit the bath on and a thermostat to regulate it .
and as it evaporates , it will knit itself together , forming seams .
obviously , as a designer , that 's really exciting because then i start to think , wow , we could actually imagine growing consumable products .
i want to say a word for nature because we haven 't talked that much about it the last couple days .
we know that what 's going on between the bee and that flower is that bee has been cleverly manipulated by that flower .
and that , wouldn 't this be kind of an interesting way to look at the world ?
it releases this volatile chemical that goes out into the world and summons another species of mite that comes in and attacks the spider mite , defending the lima bean .
i went looking for a farm where these ideas about looking at things from the species ' point of view are actually implemented , and i found it in a man . the farmer 's name is joel salatin .
so the chickens do their kind of little breakdance and they 're pushing around the manure to get at the grubs , and in the process they 're spreading the manure out .
it 's created from the bottom up .
this is the number of people joining the global middle class by 2030 , coming out of poverty .
i 'm going to refer to some of those as well , and i 'm just going to mention a few of the commitments as illustrations that we 've got .
they produced heat and a little bit of light on the side .
it 's a brilliant textile in use .
and we 've decided in the next three years , we will double the volume of certified material we put through our business .
and this came in ikea actually in the ' 90s .
so the message here is , measure what you care about and lead the change , and don 't wait a hundred years .
it was an astronomy book , and i poured over that thing for hours on end , and it was a combination of all these things that inspired me to pursue space exploration as my own personal dream , and part of that dream was , i always wanted to just fly around the solar system and visit different planets and visit moons and spacecraft .
here we have the mars science laboratory on its way to mars , just launched last weekend .
it only looks like nothing 's moving because , well , saturn here is 700,000 miles away , and titan here is 4,000 to 5,000 miles away .
you can fly around yourself and you can learn for yourself .
all right : " i 'm more than my genes " -- all together .
we don 't know for sure , but there are theories .
so we start at the top , and we color in the cross-section of one branch in red , and we do that for the next slice and for the next slice .
but seriously , what 's wrong with this ?
why did i choose to study this organ that is so awesome in its complexity that it might well be infinite ?
to some extent , they are programmed by your genes .
and if you 'll allow me to ascend to metaphorical heights , i will remind you that neural activity is the physical basis -- or so neuroscientists think -- of thoughts , feelings and perceptions .
but if you have , you know it 's very easy to make a mistake .
the question is : has that damage erased the connectome ?
can we create a system using today 's most advanced technologies that can allow this part of the world to leapfrog in the same way they 've done with mobile telephones in the last 10 years ?
first of all , the uavs .
so this is a $ 3,000 vehicle .
so let 's look at the other end of the spectrum : our cities and megacities .
we do need to engage , though , in social fiction to make it happen .
they point to the successes of aid : the eradication of smallpox , and the distribution of tens of millions of malaria bed nets and antiretrovirals .
in 2002 i met this incredible entrepreneur named amitabha sadangi from india , who 'd been working for 20 years with some of the poorest farmers on the planet .
and we helped him build a company , for profit , that would build on ide 's knowledge , and start looking at sales and exports , and be able to tap into other kinds of capital .
and i would submit that it 's time to consider a global innovation fund that would find these entrepreneurs around the world who really have innovations , not only for their country , but ones that we can use in the developed world as well .
and finally , at the end of the journey , i could see this thin little yellow line across the horizon .
the time for us to begin innovating and looking for new solutions , a cross sector , is now .
they 'd worn themselves out , beating themselves against the window , and , well , they were easy to capture .
in a helicopter you feel -- and it 's still a remarkable sensation -- you feel like you 're being hauled up from above by a vibrating crane .
so the issue then , i 've often asked , is when is it going to happen ?
you can play computer games , you can sleep , you can read on the way .
that 's a macabre comment because we lost a lot of pilots .
if one of those fails , you still have a second chance .
only seven percent said that they wouldn 't consider buying a skycar .
chimborazo !
now i clicked on this on purpose , but if i 'd somehow gotten here by mistake , it does remind me , for the band , see " the beatles , " for the car see " volkswagon beetle , " but i am here for beetle beetles .
so those of you who only eat your chocolate , you might have to experiment .
he lives in rainforests and savannas .
this is the kind of fact i would have loved as a boy .
and why have we not made the connection , between — how has that happened ? — between these incredible characters of popular culture and religions , and the fostered , adopted or orphaned child in our midst ? it 's not our pity that they need .
it 's kind of easy to patronize the past , to forego our responsibilities in the present .
and it turns out i 've got the devil inside of me .
when i got to the — for the next four , five years , i was held in four different children 's homes .
i 'm not defining a good family from a bad family .
infants don 't respond to much .
that 's all another way of saying that our individual skills and abilities are very much shaped by our environments .
and i see the brain actually develop a processor that is specialized -- specialized for that complex array , a repertoire of sounds .
this lifelong capacity for plasticity , for brain change , is powerfully expressed .
we see here a reconstruction of how the hand is represented in the brain .
and the level of construction that occurs is massive .
and it 's created in the brain via physical change .
well , it was understood by a dutch surgeon , about 35 years ago , that if you simply fix the problem early enough , when the brain is still in this initial plastic period so it can set up this machinery adequately , in this initial set up time in the critical period , none of that happens .
they are about an order of magnitude longer , about 11 times longer in duration on average , than in a normal child .
this is like an iq test for language .
and what you see are substantial improvements of their immediate memory , of their ability to remember things after a delay , of their ability to control their attention , their language abilities and visual-spatial abilities .
i 'm going to talk about a new , old material that still continues to amaze us , and that might impact the way we think about material science , high technology -- and maybe , along the way , also do some stuff for medicine and for global health and help reforestation .
and this is an insight that came , about two decades ago , from a person that i 'm very fortunate to work with , david kaplan .
and the most remarkable feat is that my hand actually stayed still long enough to do that .
but you can do things like cups , for example , and so , if you add a little bit of gold , if you add a little bit of semiconductors you could do sensors that stick on the surfaces of foods .
and so if you change the recipe , and you add things when you pour -- so you add things to your liquid silk solution -- where these things are enzymes or antibodies or vaccines , the self-assembly process preserves the biological function of these dopants .
this was me at age 13 , when i started my first diet .
if you lose a lot of weight , your brain reacts as if you were starving , and whether you started out fat or thin , your brain 's response is exactly the same .
the interesting thing is that intuitive eaters are less likely to be overweight , and they spend less time thinking about food .
five years after a diet , most people have regained the weight .
diets may seem harmless , but they actually do a lot of collateral damage .
low-lying cities all around the world will disappear within the lifetime of children born today .
let me translate for you .
now how did we do this ? how did we go from being hunter-gatherers 10,000 years ago to building these gigantic cities in just a few thousand years ?
but in the 1980s and ' 90s , the electromagnet turns back on .
that 's actually not so bad . if you go back to the carter and even reagan administrations , they were rating the other party 43 , 45 . it 's not terrible .
from my experience , and from what i 've heard from congressional insiders , most of the people going to congress are good , hard-working , intelligent people who really want to solve problems , but once they get there , they find that they are forced to play a game that rewards hyper-partisanship and that punishes independent thinking .
but what if the situation we face is not a single threat but is actually more like this , where there 's just so much stuff coming in , it 's just , " start shooting , come on , everybody , we 've got to just work together , just start shooting . "
now the right has been screaming about this asteroid since the 1960s , and the left has been saying , " it 's not a problem . it 's not a problem . "
okay , almost all of you .
and let our first mission be to press congress to reform itself , before it 's too late for our nation .
we can print drugs at point of need .
i 'm progressive , politically -- big surprise -- but i 've always gone out of my way to meet conservatives .
and this was the big story of the day at that time .
you know we all want to be someone who has watched " rashomon , " but right now we want to watch " ace ventura " for the fourth time .
and we need the new gatekeepers to encode that kind of responsibility into the code that they 're writing .
compassion helps him turn away from the feeling of his suffering as the most absolute , most terrible suffering anyone has ever had and broadens his awareness of the sufferings of others , even of the perpetrators of his misery and the whole mass of beings .
and the man said , " i 'm making a needle . "
he thinks , " what can i do to fix up this dog ?
he jumps back and there , of course , is the future buddha maitreya in a beautiful vision -- rainbow lights , golden , jeweled , a plasma body , an exquisite mystic vision -- that he sees .
and maitreya then kept him in heaven for five years , dictating to him five complicated tomes of the methodology of how you cultivate compassion .
you gave me that expression ; " the eternal mama , " you said . that 's wonderful .
and you think of him as nursing you .
and you feel a love toward them and you want them to be happy , even the enemy .
and , of course , they are cruel and ruthless toward others .
we absolutely must do that . there is no way not to do it .
it was basically a regenerative medicine issue .
and the longer we live , the more expensive it is to take care of our diseases as we get older .
i 'd suggest there are four things , and none of these things include an insurance system or a legal system .
so today 's reality is that if we get sick , the message is we will treat your symptoms , and you need to adjust to a new way of life .
the first is cellular therapies .
this is a diabetic ulcer . it 's tragic .
after treatment that 's what it looks like .
you see the cells coming back out .
all done in the lab .
clearly the images kind of get that across .
and at the end of a very testy meeting , what the nih director said was , " your vision is larger than our appetite . "
here 's one of the culprits .
perhaps it was like these toddler rules : it 's my stuff if i saw it first .
and the plastics , we get from oil , which we go to more remote locations and drill ever deeper wells to extract .
so the traditional ways of separating materials just simply don 't work for plastics .
because after all , we 're doing above-ground mining .
and they get to make more sustainable products .
and today , we 're producing it from your old stuff , and it 's going right back into your new stuff .
people have used this software to map everything from roads to rivers , from schools to local businesses , and video stores to the corner store .
and it 's a wonderful thing .
then each of the different little pieces around it explain some fact .
so you can lavish all the same care , all the same technique , on a hamburger as you would on some much more fancy dish .
now you can also see a little bit how we did some of these shots .
everybody knows that your various appliances have wattage , right ?
as it comes out of the grinder , you just have a little tray , and you just take it off in little passes , build it up , slice it vertically .
anyway , here 's the book .
now this was revolutionary .
here it is .
it has internal inconsistencies , unless we allow for something wholly unfamiliar -- extra dimensions of space .
each is as real as every other , in the sense that there are many universes , each with a different shape , for the extra dimensions .
we now know that there are many planets at a wide variety of different distances from their host stars .
instead the fuel not only generated our big bang , but it would also generate countless other big bangs , each giving rise to its own separate universe with our universe becoming but one bubble in a grand cosmic bubble bath of universes .
now maybe those future astronomers will have records handed down from an earlier era , like ours , attesting to an expanding cosmos teeming with galaxies .
holy cow ! that 's just amazing .
and how people get this music , how it comes into their lives , really fascinates me .
it 's just a design of pitches and silence and time .
now inspired moves of improvisation could be recorded , saved , considered , prioritized , made into intricate designs .
and the how was harmony , stacking up the pitches to form chords .
now this moment so fascinates me .
what sticks with people ?
you don 't need to worry about knowing anything .
but it would have done so at a price to hundreds of patients who , like celine , were left to their own devices once the research had been completed .
local communities need to be more involved in establishing the criteria for recruiting participants in clinical trials , as well as the incentives for participation .
now , fortunately for celine , our meeting did not end in my office .
when we learn of tribal practices , some of them will horrify us , but there are other tribal practices which , when we hear about them , we may admire and envy and wonder whether we could adopt those practices ourselves .
another traditional usefulness of older people is that they are capable of babysitting their grandchildren , thereby freeing up their own adult children , the parents of those grandchildren , to go hunting and gathering food for the grandchildren .
ads for coca-cola and beer always depict smiling young people , even though old as well as young people buy and drink coca-cola and beer .
conversely , i at age 75 am incompetent at skills essential for everyday life .
the remaining value of older people that i 'll mention involves recognizing that while there are many things that older people can no longer do , there are other things that they can do better than younger people .
features of the modern lifestyle predispose us to those diseases , and features of the traditional lifestyle protect us against them .
but our current funeral practices make the situation much worse .
i realize this is not the kind of relationship that we usually aspire to have with our food .
accepting death means accepting that we are physical beings who are intimately connected to the environment , as the research on environmental toxins confirms .
and at last , we appear to be doing something about it .
so when we are confronted by a powerful image , we all have a choice : we can look away , or we can address the image .
so , indeed , i have spent my life looking into the lives of presidents who are no longer alive .
but there were so many losses in his early life that he was haunted by death .
" everyone is broken by life , " ernest hemingway once said , " but some people are stronger in the broken places . "
but as he was about to put his signature on the proclamation his own hand was numb and shaking because he had shaken a thousand hands that morning at a new year 's reception .
the lyndon johnson that i saw in the last years of his life , when i helped him on his memoirs , was a man who had spent so many years in the pursuit of work , power and individual success , that he had absolutely no psychic or emotional resources left to get him through the days once the presidency was gone .
but i also worried that part of it was that i was then a young woman .
in those last years , he said he was so sad watching the american people look toward a new president and forgetting him .
" oh , yes , " he said , " perfectly appropriate place for him . "
so i went to my father in tears , " what are we going to do ? "
but luckily , my first confession -- to a baseball-loving priest !
and she 's a very high-tech superintendent .
so i got a degree and it turned out to be education .
he proposed the film to me -- it 's a great title .
and miss banks was there as a great mentor for me .
i 'll make something -- i didn 't say interactive ; we didn 't have that term in 1978 -- but something interactive .
if al gore is here , i 'm going to send my fourth-graders from agnor-hurt and venable schools to you because they solved global warming in a week .
and because i don 't know , they 've got to dig up the answer .
this is the world peace game . what is wrong with you ? "
so you have a little bit more thought before you commit to combat .
and i think it 's sort of weird to be living what sun tzu said .
they shouldn 't be failing like this .
every game we play is different .
i 'm going to illustrate it with some fairly concrete examples , but always pointing to the broader themes .
there are a large number of people on the internet , a very small fraction of them have photos of the mermaid parade .
when you build cooperation into the infrastructure , which is the flickr answer , you can leave the people where they are and you take the problem to the individuals , rather than moving the individuals to the problem .
what matters is this .
that sounds strange because we expect average and middle to be about the same , but they 're not at all .
you can hire those people as employees , you can coordinate their work and you can get some output .
right ? bad hire . right ?
it 's a revolution in that it 's a change in equilibrium .
these are groups of teenage girls who have taken on web logs , bulletin boards , other kinds of cooperative infrastructure , and have used it to set up support groups for remaining anorexic by choice .
now , i 'm not predicting 200 years of chaos as a result of this . 50 .
and we have not thought enough about the solutions .
but as early as 1968 , this visionary man , robert kennedy , at the start of his ill-fated presidential campaign , gave the most eloquent deconstruction of gross national product that ever has been .
and what we do , is we say that the ultimate outcome of a nation is how successful is it at creating happy and healthy lives for its citizens .
they are the u.s.a. , other western countries going across in those triangles and a few gulf states in there actually .
we can look at some of the data .
it 's actually not very long away .
human beings are very motivated by the " now . "
do you invest the time with your loved ones that you could do , and energy ?
you measure their happiness at the end of the day , those that have gone and spent on other people are much happier that those that spent it on themselves .
if you 're living outside like me , you 're faced with life in exile -- the pain of the longing and the separation from your loved ones and your family .
our people depend on our artists , and culture is beyond communication .
i work in morocco , in turkey , in mexico .
the challenge i have is how to do that .
i want to start with a game .
what i want to talk about is not that context is everything , but why is context everything .
they are the same , as far as your eye is concerned .
but you put one there . why ?
why ? because your brain is seeing that same information as if the right one is still under red light , and the left one is still under green light .
so you see it that way .
so i can ask you , which direction is it rotating ?
now she is drinking a glass of water that 's about that big to you and i , will do that about three times , and then fly .
and they can navigate the world using their ears .
we 're defined by our environment and our interaction with that environment -- by our ecology .
and i 'll leave you with that .
so in this example , a distribution company has said , we 've got a rush order that we 've got to get out of the warehouse tomorrow morning .
because right now there are so many people who need whatever economic opportunity they can get .
a modern market is more than a website ; it 's a web of interoperable marketplaces , back office mechanisms , regulatory regimes , settlement mechanisms , liquidity sources and so on .
our government didn 't design the national lottery , it didn 't fund the national lottery , it doesn 't operate the national lottery .
and there are certain obligations that should go with those benefits to be placed on the operators , and the key one is , of course , that the operators pay for everything , including all the interfacing into the public sector .
this kind of data can become routine .
and she said , " well , one . "
and what was good about psychology , about the 30 billion dollar investment nimh made , about working in the disease model , about what you mean by psychology , is that , 60 years ago , none of the disorders were treatable -- it was entirely smoke and mirrors .
so that was not good .
each of them is in a romantic relationship and each has a rich repertoire of friends .
so the different tricks that matthieu [ ricard ] and i and others know about increasing the amount of positive emotion in your life are 15 to 20 percent tricks , getting more of it .
when he walks onto the floor of the american exchange at 9 : 30 in the morning , time stops for him . and it stops till the closing bell .
you don 't giggle a lot . what you get is more absorption .
your assignment , when you 're learning the gratitude visit , is to write a 300-word testimonial to that person , call them on the phone in phoenix , ask if you can visit , don 't tell them why , show up at their door , you read the testimonial -- everyone weeps when this happens .
and what we 're asking now is does the very same relationship , physical health , morbidity , how long you live and productivity , follow the same relationship ?
if entertainment can be diverted to also increase positive emotion , meaning , eudaimonia , it will be good enough .
well it means if you them together you suddenly have circuits -- circuits that the most creative , tiny , little hands can build on their own .
we can even add microprocessors and have this as an input and create squishy sound music that we 've done .
and on that elevator a man said , " i hear billy graham is staying in this hotel . "
and there 's one that i want to talk about .
over again and again in the psalms , which gladstone said was the greatest book in the world , david describes the evils of the human race .
albert einstein -- i was just talking to someone , when i was speaking at princeton , and i met mr. einstein .
they don 't know what it is . i speak at many universities , and i have many questions and answer periods , and whether it 's cambridge , or harvard , or oxford -- i 've spoken at all of those universities .
but i 'm -- in a few months , i 'll be 80 years of age .
most people live as if they 're never going to die .
i 've talked to them .
and i was invited one day to visit chancellor adenauer , who was looked upon as sort of the founder of modern germany , since the war .
it was he who penned the well-known words , " the heart has its reasons , which reason knows not of . "
he was a liar .
i have been living and teaching in the gulf for over 30 years .
and we were the first non-muslims to teach in the state schools there in kuwait .
we english teachers are the gatekeepers .
this system equates intelligence with a knowledge of english , which is quite arbitrary .
but they couldn 't get the results they wanted .
let us celebrate diversity .
the solution , in fact , may be closer to hand than we think , because all of those cities we 're building are opportunities .
and this is a huge , huge energy savings , because what comes out of our tailpipe is really just the beginning of the story with climate emissions from cars .
the average home power drill is used somewhere between six and 20 minutes in its entire lifetime , depending on who you ask .
now all of these are fine projects , but they really have missed an essential point , which is it 's not about the leaves above , it 's about the systems below .
" let 's have a dance , " one girl shouted , and all the girls quickly backed her up .
we want every girl to experience the dance , right ? "
so we brought in flip cams , and we had them look at the flip cams and just interview each other -- their messages , their thoughts .
and one documentary writer , who was here and looked at this two months after i was here , described this not as beehives but as a graveyard , with these empty white boxes with no bees left in them .
and you can install this in your hive and replace that dead-out .
the ancient egyptians used to move bees up and down the nile on rafts , so this idea of a movable bee force is not new at all .
now , i want to just illustrate that in the fact that if we look at the breakfast i had yesterday morning -- a little cranberry juice , some fruits , some granola , i should have had whole wheat bread , i realized , but you know , jam on my wonderbread , and some coffee -- and had we taken out all those ingredients , -- except for the almonds i wasn 't going to pick out from the granola -- if we had taken out all those ingredients the bees had indirectly or directly pollinated , we wouldn 't have much on our plate .
we also have the sweat bees , and these are little gems flying around .
and i think that there is an easy cure for ndd .
bees apparently , can be the gateway to , you know , other things .
if they hadn 't been crowded -- you compare the loss of life at the pentagon to the twin towers , and you can see that very powerfully .
i mean , you know , the emergency bunker was right there , was destroyed by the attacks , and obviously the damage done to the building and the lives .
but nothing really says this model of interactivity -- which was so exciting and captures the real , the web zeitgeist of 1995 -- than " click here for a picture of my dog . "
and you can get a list .
well , you know , we should expect to see that .
and right behind him is l. ron hubbard . so -- you can see we 're in the ascot , which is always good .
now there was a very interesting article by clay shirky that got a lot of attention about a month ago , and this is basically the distribution of links on the web to all these various different blogs .
so the most wonderful thing , i think , about this whole debate about power laws and software that could change it is the fact that we 're having the conversation .
to be a woman means not to be a girl .
and i will tell you that what happened is through that shattering , listening to the stories of eight-year-old girls who had their insides eviscerated , who had guns and bayonets and things shoved inside them so they had holes , literally , inside them where their pee and poop came out of them .
and all these men , literally at least 10 men , were in their little seats watching chick flicks .
i want to change the verb .
dorcas is 15 years old , and she was trained in self-defense .
and there was a young girl named jaclyn .
and i give you my word , here and now , that we will not cut your sisters either . "
things do not come to me as intellectual theories or hard-pressed ideas .
i know my father isn 't coming back , and that no one 's prepared for the fire .
thank you very much .
could it be there is something more going on here ?
100 years to the day after the death of alfred nobel himself .
or you can go to the random house website where there is this excerpt .
last year , i told you the story , in seven minutes , of project orion , which was this very implausible technology that technically could have worked , but it had this one-year political window where it could have happened .
and leibniz was the first person to really talk about building such a machine .
rca , in probably one of the lousiest business decisions of all time , decided not to go into computers .
they were real soldering-gun type guys , and they actually built this thing .
" running time : two minutes . input , output : 90 minutes . "
" master control off . the hell with it . way off . "
and sometimes things are okay .
he would run that thing all night long , running these things , if anybody remembers stephen wolfram , who reinvented this stuff .
and could you do it again now ?
this was published after he died : his sort of unfinished notes on self-reproducing machines , what it takes to get the machines sort of jump-started to where they begin to reproduce .
it 's just neat ; it 's fun . it 's so much fun i have it in my house -- but i have it in the entryway , i don 't use it to make juice .
or look at google .
it 's round , it 's neat .
would you tie those two strings together ? "
that 's especially good that mammals and primates like fruits and bright plants , because you eat the fruit and you thereby spread the seed .
and behavioral design is all about feeling in control , which includes usability , understanding -- but also the feel and heft .
and that 's why we can tell the emotion of somebody else -- because their muscles are acting , subconsciously , except that we 've evolved to make the facial muscles really rich with emotion .
and what 's neat is sometimes you pit one emotion against the other , the visceral fear of falling against the reflective state saying , " it 's ok . it 's ok . it 's safe . it 's safe . "
although you can see the gentleman up on the right is busting him .
so , as we lose the context of our identity , it becomes incredibly important that what you share becomes the context of shared narrative , becomes the context in which we live .
now that we see these huge differences in savings rates , how is it possible that language might have something to do with these differences ?
it 's simply not permissible in english to say , " it rain tomorrow . "
i 'm a professor , i get paid to have fanciful theories .
do you happen to know how much your house is worth ? do you mind telling me ?
does this have cumulative effects ?
many of you might be familiar with taz , the cartoon character , the one that spins around and around and around .
but inevitably , these tumors progress towards being enormous , ulcerating tumors like this one here .
paradoxically , once established , natural selection actually favors the continued growth of cancer .
in fact , jonas and his tumor were as different from each other as you and the person sitting next to you .
last year , his owner noticed some blood trickling from his genital region .
what this tells us , ethical issues aside , is that ...
now nanny 's great other insight was to think , perhaps we should get derek something to play , and sure enough , she dragged this little keyboard out of the loft , never thinking really that anything much would come of it .
and in the end , derek , i think you agreed that we could actually have some fun playing the piano together .
now then .
fantastic chap .
he 's sitting there .
i 'm just going to list some of them .
because we can 't solve problems .
and since there are many more not-number-one spots on the list than there is number ones , it makes perfect sense not to want to do such a list .
and so on .
these were the bad projects .
so we have to ask ourselves , do we want to spend twice the amount on doing very little good ?
that would be the third best thing we could do .
i find a lot of people find it very , very unlikely that we should do that .
we have , you know , " the day after tomorrow " -- it looks great , right ?
and they 're not necessarily , you know , great ways of looking at the entire world .
" what i will " i will not dance to your war drum .
i will not be played .
are you holding her ?
before form i was storm , blind , ign 'ant -- still am .
we mourn each one or we mean nothing at all .
and one day , a vessel not unlike this will probably break the world speed record .
the majority of it is in the higher altitudes , above 300 feet , where we don 't have a technology as yet to get there .
so that is audacious , you say . i agree .
i wanted " upwake " to have the same audiovisual qualities as a movie would .
there are no special effects in " upwake , " no artifice .
because through your mask , they let theirs go .
this is a time of communication , connection and creative collaboration .
because if you don 't close that gap , you really are exactly where we are today .
it 's a terrible business model .
so we looked at this , and we thought , okay , artisanal is wonderful in , you know , your clothing and your bread and crafts , but artisanal really isn 't going to work in stem cells , so we have to deal with this .
instead of investing in a car , we invest in a community .
and it 's not just with transportation , my love , but of course in other realms . here 's fiverr.com.
so let me take you back how it 's so incredibly different building buzzcar than it was building zipcar , because now every single thing we do has these two different bodies that i have to be thinking about : the owners who are going to provide the cars and the drivers who are going to rent them .
but what does peer production do ? peer production is this completely different way of doing things , and you have a big quality range , and so ebay , cleverly , the first peer production , peer , inc. company , i 'd say , they figured out early on , we need to have ratings and commentaries and all that yucky side stuff .
so i continue to think that transportation is the center of the hard universe .
as a frenchman , i must say that there are a lot of french intellectuals that think happiness is not at all interesting .
and that can also come from some kind of confusions .
because we are speaking of a different level .
we know , by experience , that we can be what we call " a little paradise , " and yet , be completely unhappy within .
aren 't those negative emotions , or destructive emotions , inherent to the nature of mind ?
but , of course , each emotion then would need a particular antidote .
a violinist , as we heard , who has done 10,000 hours of violin practice , some area that controls the movements of fingers in the brain change a lot , increasing reinforcement of the synaptic connections .
so there 's a basic line for people . and also , it can be changed .
yet , we spend surprisingly little time taking care of what matters most -- the way our mind functions -- which , again , is the ultimate thing that determines the quality of our experience .
today i combine all my passions as the ceo of interaxon , a thought-controlled computing company .
and eventually that vacation 's got to come to an end .
the more relaxed i am , the more the energy 's going to fall through it .
but we 're always interested in multi-tiered levels of human interaction .
in the game that we created , of course , you control the wooden form that 's on the screen there with your mind .
perhaps even more importantly , thought-controlled computing can give children with add insights into their own fluctuating mental states , so they can better understand themselves and their learning needs .
we can begin to see the underlying narratives that propel us forward and tell us about what 's going on .
the first is we can now eavesdrop safely on healthy brain activity .
they 're immiscible . they don 't mix with one another .
here 's a couple . they 're sharing a moment together , and we 've even done an experiment where you can cut out different pieces of this frame and you can still see that they 're sharing it . they 're sharing it sort of in parallel .
what do people do ? people are indifferent at an 80-20 split .
well , the so what is , that 's a really nice behavioral measure , the economic games bring to us notions of optimal play .
what 's in the box ?
with over 300 entries from around the world , i got it , my own little jewel box .
so we want things that nest , we want things that stack , and we want it digitized .
maybe , just maybe , less might equal more .
you know when they do homeworks at home ?
it 's really interesting : what many people think when i say the word " design " is they think of this kind of overdesigned -- in this case , it 's overdesigned on purpose , but -- decoration , interior decoration .
and you see ideo there .
and then when 9 / 11 happened , i had a shock and i canceled the exhibition until , slowly but surely , it came back -- as a half-full glass instead of half-empty -- and it was about protection and safety .
and it was really interesting because i was the last speaker and before me there were people that were really talking about luxury , and i didn 't want to be a party pooper but at the same time i felt that i had to kind of bring back the discourse to reality .
but it surely is a very important moment for design , because not only is the technology proceeding , not only is computing technology making open-source possible also in the world of design , but also the idea of sustainability -- which is not only sustainability from the viewpoint of co2 emissions and footprint , but also sustainability of human interrelationships -- is very much part of the work of so many designers .
i loved statistics from a young age .
that was the year when queen victoria was able , for the first time , to communicate with president buchanan , through the transatlantic telegraphic cable .
and i also bring an innovation here .
still under foreign domination , and without sovereignty , india and china are down in the corner .
and both countries had the better health , but still a very low economy .
and if i would also look at india , you have another type of inequity , actually , in india .
but most of the world in the middle are pushing forwards very fast .
they seem to go in a more humble growth way , you know .
and will asia be able to handle that new position of being in charge of being the most mighty , and the governors of the world ?
and that 's because if you take a brain out of the skull and you cut a thin slice of it , put it under even a very powerful microscope , there 's nothing there .
and so coming back to the brain , this is from a genetically engineered mouse called " brainbow . "
what some of us may not realize is that in the himalayan foothills , where the climate is much warmer and the landscape much greener , there lives a great diversity of wildlife , including the one-horned rhinoceros , the asian elephant and the bengal tiger .
sometimes , we fly the drone in a lawnmower-type pattern and take pictures of that area , and those pictures can be processed to produce a map of that forest .
but drones could also be used to keep track of illegal logging activities .
this drone , carrying a special sensor , could be flown over the forest and remotely download these images from wi-fi – enabled cameras .
and in a way , they are right .
the first author , alexis carrel , a nobel prize winner .
you saw the spray going in .
another technology that we have used in patients actually involves bladders .
and there 's a 3d elevator that then actually goes down one layer at a time each time the printhead goes through .
i don 't know if you realize this , but 90 percent of the patients on the transplant list are actually waiting for a kidney .
thank you , dr. kang . i appreciate it .
luke , come up please .
je : well , it 's an honor and a privilege to meet you .
jh : because if the power went out , there would just be a big noise .
and if you put them together in different combinations -- just like printing in a sense , like how a magazine color is printed -- and put them under certain forces , which is orbiting them or passing them back and forth or drawing with them , these amazing things started appearing .
it could be tomato sauce , or anything could be dispensed -- sand , powders or anything like that .
and i love the shapes that i see in scientific observations and apparatus , especially astronomical forms and the idea of the vastness of it , the scale , is very interesting to me .
all my creations really start on small drawings , which i have thousands of , and it 's my way of just thinking .
until one day in ninth grade , when i was standing with a number of the football players .
we got a lot of things right .
that 's who we talk about when we think about " the poor . "
a couple of years later , i meet them .
it 's the largest company in tanzania .
only then did she talk about saving your children 's lives .
we 're going to do a song by david mash called " listen : the words are gone , " and maybe i 'll have words come back into me afterwards if i can relax .
i think we will play another tune now .
there are about 120 , you see them here .
all we did was look for portraits that had the characteristics of a self-portrait , and look , they are very similar .
and this is , of course , not the first time you 've probably recognized this .
and having thought about this a little bit , i see a couple different possibilities .
these guys are new world primates , which means they broke off from the human branch about 35 million years ago .
so now we faced , you know , a little bit of a problem here .
here 's mayday . she 's going to be trading a token for some food and waiting happily and getting her food .
and that 's what the monkey can for a single token .
the other thing we also spontaneously saw , embarrassingly enough , is spontaneous evidence of larceny .
so see what your intuition is here .
so what 's going on ?
and so this is what this looks like .
these are three grapes ; the monkey 's really psyched for this .
but of course , you know , the reason you 're laughing is bad for humans too .
so that 's the bad news . the question is : is there any good news ?
and their diagnosis was this : they said , " you have two rare kidney diseases that are going to actually destroy your kidneys eventually , you have cancer-like cells in your immune system that we need to start treatment right away , and you 'll never be eligible for a kidney transplant , and you 're not likely to live more than two or three years . "
this is not a wardrobe malfunction . i have to take my belt off here .
ed : all right.tb : okay . turn it a little bit inside , a little bit toward the middle for me .
humans invented the idea of hospitals and clinics in the 1780s . it is time to update our thinking .
eighty percent of medical errors are actually caused by communication and coordination problems amongst medical team members .
my team is actually working in china on one of these self-care models for a project we called age-friendly cities .
the future that intel 's working on now is to figure out how to make that computing for personalized medicine go from months and weeks to even hours , and make this kind of tool available , not just in the mainframes of tier-one research hospitals around the world , but in the mainstream -- every patient , every clinic with access to whole genome sequencing .
probably not . so , why do i call this a biologically inspired robot ? how would it work ?
so we have two prototypes .
ah , isn 't that cool ?
so , this is actually based on that . this robot is called mars : multi-appendage robotic system . so , it 's a hexapod robot .
the problem is they 're just too expensive , tens of thousands of dollars .
we actually have a fan club for the robot , darwin : dynamic anthropomorphic robot with intelligence .
it 's an international autonomous robot soccer competition .
we truly believe this is going to be the very first running humanoid robot in the united states . so , stay tuned .
many times it 's empty , sometimes i have something there -- if something 's there , sometimes it 's junk -- but most of the time i can 't even read my handwriting .
well , actually , there are two sides to the story .
think about everything it has brought us .
that 's 25 years ago .
what i 'm running here is a system that enables me to run age-old programs on a modern computer .
we find tens of thousands , even hundreds of thousands .
and that , obviously , is a problem .
now , criminals who weren 't capable of reaching us before can reach us .
and i was looking at that , trying to figure out what it means .
now i 'm not a lawyer , but if i would be , this is where i would say , " i rest my case . "
everything is reliant on these computers working .
or perhaps not quite on earth .
this is a screen capture from " stagecoach , " where yakima canutt is doing one of the most dangerous stunts i 've ever seen .
not today .
it 's a great job , really .
that 's all it is , a bouncy castle .
and that 's centre point in london .
this is joe kittenger himself .
we will have two balloons for each of my test jumps , and two balloons for the main jump , because they notoriously tear on takeoff .
this is what the view is going to be like at 90,000 feet for me .
then they 're comfortable , they have good vision , like this great big visor .
there 's a beautiful statement on the screen that says , " light creates ambiance , light makes the feel of a space , and light is also the expression of structure . "
they created this shade that you can see here , which actually covers the sun , but opens up to the good light from the sky .
so you begin with focal glow .
it 's a little bit of a different story , this health aspect of light , than what i 'm telling you today .
and , i mean , that is quite amazing , what you see here -- how much light goes up into the sky and never reaches the ground .
it 's the same thing as you can see over there -- just 200 times bigger .
or can we create simply sculptures that are very inspiring to be in and to be around ?
in architecture , it works just the same .
but i 'm also going to argue that once you understand the sense in which they are built into human nature , you realize that just affirming compassion , and affirming the golden rule , is really not enough .
and so , you wind up most easily extending compassion to friends and allies .
we have the capacity to carve out exceptions , put people in a special category .
and if you ask what kind of situation is conducive to people defining people as enemies , it 's a zero-sum situation .
but it may . and the good news is that history has naturally expanded these webs of non-zero-sumness , these webs that can be these channels for compassion .
and so , the question is : if there 's so much non-zero-sumness , why has the world not yet been suffused in love , peace , and understanding ?
you know , they 'll resist that comparison and that 's natural , that 's human .
i have my clients . i am doing my work like i always did .
well , to describe our profession otherwise , we are actually concerned with the playful search for beauty .
and there i really worked as an apprentice .
and that was in hamburg .
and if this is the end of my five minutes , i want to tell you that i actually did survive , which was a surprise .
well it turns out you have 100 times more bacterial genes playing a role in you or on you all of your life .
what was actually interesting to us was not that the bacteria made light , but when the bacteria made light .
and it opens and closes the shutter so the amount of light coming out of the bottom -- which is made by the bacterium -- exactly matches how much light hits the squid 's back , so the squid doesn 't make a shadow .
it 's not like a couple bacteria get in you and they start secreting some toxins -- you 're enormous , that would have no effect on you . you 're huge .
anywhere on your body , it looks pretty much like this , and what i hope you can see is that there 's all kinds of bacteria there .
couldn 't these be new kinds of antibiotics ?
what we 've been able to do is to give these virulent infections , but we give them in conjunction with our anti-quorum sensing molecules -- so these are molecules that look kind of like the real thing , but they 're a little bit different which i 've depicted on this slide .
so , we 've targeted those systems to make the molecules work better .
what 's happened in the music world is there 's a culture or an ecosystem that 's been created that , if you take some words from apple , the catchphrase that we create , rip , mix and burn .
think of it as a massive itunes for book type content .
people , volunteers and even companies that are translating material into asian languages like chinese , japanese and thai , to spread the knowledge even further .
this costs , anybody guess ?
remember we took the book , tore the pages out ?
even the three wise men .
so i 'd like to conclude with just the last few points .
i 'm here for two reasons . these two guys are my two sons ford and wren .
i soon realized that manspaces didn 't have to be only inside .
but you open one of the garage doors and there is a professional-size boxing ring inside .
i didn 't realize there was going to be a little music before .
see , these are all right inside of the color palette .
so there is no mistake .
so if i want the music to get to a certain level of intensity , the first step for me is to be patient , to listen to what 's going on and pull from something that 's going on around me .
there 's a dreadful fungus that 's sort of moving through the world that 's called the chytrid fungus , and it 's nailing frogs all over the world .
and i said , " mike , by any chance -- " this was 30 or 40 years ago — " by any chance had you kept any frozen tissue of this frog ? "
we even dna tested some of these cells , and the dna of the extinct frog is in those cells .
we found the biggest bird in the world , bigger than that thing that was in madagascar , and it too was a flesh-eater . it was a giant , weird duck .
wild dogs did eat a few of the sheep , but the thylacine got a bad rap .
we were very excited .
it is , shortly , going to think it 's got the ugliest tasmanian devil baby in the world , so maybe it 'll need some help to keep it going .
and it just , when i spoke to this man , i was looking in his eyes and thinking , behind those eyes is a brain that has memories of what thylacines feel like , what they smelled like , what they sounded like .
sometimes you might be able to put it back , but is that the safest way to make sure it never goes extinct again , and i don 't think so .
his brothers , chandrabhan and phoolchand , were also listed as dead .
and it 's meant to kind of reflect how we engage with histories or stories on the internet , in a less linear form .
in his bloodline you see the children and grandchildren here .
in chapter seven , i focus on the effects of a genocidal act on one bloodline .
you can also see the evolution of the one-child-only policy as it travels through the bloodline .
and they are in an active blood feud .
this is a girls ' bedroom .
i 'm just carving around whatever i find interesting .
so i 'm creating a piece that the viewer is completing themselves .
why have i chosen to talk to you about the phosphorus crisis today ?
phosphorus is a key component in several molecules , in many of our molecules of life .
let me explain .
and if i make a comparison with oil , there 's an oil crisis , we talk about it , we talk about global warming , yet we never mention the phosphorus crisis .
the solution i 'm offering today is one that has existed for a very long time , even before plants existed on earth , and it 's a microscopic mushroom that is very mysterious , very simple , and yet also extremely complex .
it 's a win-win trade : i give you phosphorus , and you feed me .
mycorrhiza was used in one field but not in the other .
it doesn 't divide by nine .
how do we deal with our deepest differences , given the human propensity for conflict and the human genius at devising weapons of enormous destruction ?
that system , i call the " third side . "
i started reacting , but then i tried to remember to go to the balcony .
stories matter . as an anthropologist , i know that .
now how would you -- now think about that for a moment .
but if i walk shoulder-to-shoulder , even touching shoulders , it 's no problem .
that 's the essence of the abraham path .
and so that 's what it 's about .
what would the oak tree look like ?
one is , the secret to peace is the third side .
the wind blew very strong .
it all collapsed in the 80s and the 90s : 35,000 people lost their jobs .
this is a photograph , a typical photograph , of what the continental shelves of the world look like .
but since we ate all the oysters and we ate all the fish that would eat the plankton , there 's nothing to eat the plankton and there 's more and more of it , so it dies of old age , which is unheard of for plankton .
this is from the coast of brittany , which is being enveloped in this green , algal slime .
not all of them die ; some of them survive , some more are surviving , but it 's really bad news .
the consequence of that is that all those nutrients that fuel the great anchoveta fisheries , of the sardines of california or in peru or whatever , those slow down and those fisheries collapse .
at that point , we were looking for a fuel that was cleaner , it was cheaper , and it wasn 't ours though , it was theirs .
there are 12 .
so when somebody says , " let 's go more nuclear , let 's go wind , let 's go solar , " fine ; i 'm for anything american , anything american .
we 're headed to natural gas .
it would be three times what the saudis claim they have .
if we do -- it 's costing us a billion dollars a day for oil .
the first one was barnett shale in texas and then the marcellus up in the northeast across new york , pennsylvania , west virginia ; and haynesville in louisiana .
and so everyone can be at least happy to see a shift from coal or oil to natural gas .
but that only blew out 500 million .
fracking came out in ' 47 , and don 't believe for a minute when our president gets up there and says the department of energy 30 years ago developed fracking .
lamta have been on natural gas for 25 years .
are they a potential mate ? are they a potential networking opportunity ?
so here 's a disclaimer about me , though , before we get too deep into this .
when i would go to the bathroom , i would turn my shoes around in the stalls so that it looked like i was peeing standing up .
and then , that this discussion was drawing geographical boundaries around me .
so i decided to make a series of very simple portraits , mugshots if you will .
and we wouldn 't have been able to do any of it without the generous support of the human rights campaign .
it presents , not just the complexities found in a procession of different human beings , but the complexities found within each individual person .
where exactly does one become a second-class citizen ?
this is globalization .
they look in . they pretend , they behave , as if they believed that every country was an island that existed quite happily , independently of all the others on its own little planet in its own little solar system .
oh sure , we 're very good at empathy when it 's a question of dealing with people who kind of look like us and kind of walk and talk and eat and pray and wear like us , but when it comes to people who don 't do that , who don 't quite dress like us and don 't quite pray like us and don 't quite talk like us , do we not also have a tendency to see them ever so slightly as cardboard cutouts too ?
so i 've spent a lot of the last 10 or 15 years trying to find out what could be that self-interest that would encourage not just politicians but also businesses and general populations , all of us , to start to think a little more outwardly , to think in a bigger picture , not always to look inwards , sometimes to look outwards .
what do we mean by good ?
i don 't talk about how they behave at home because that 's measured elsewhere .
they 've spent a great deal of time over the last decades building their own economy , building their own society and their own polity , but it is to be hoped that the second phase of their growth will be somewhat more outward-looking than the first phase has been so far .
when you elect them , when you reelect them , when you vote for them , when you listen to what they 're offering you , use that word , " good , " and ask yourself , " is that what a good country would do ? "
it 's very flat , kind of rigid .
this is heavy so it feels more important . so it 's kind of cool .
when tony was 16 years old , one day , one moment , " it was mom 's gun .
maybe one of us is wrong about the wrong .
so when he gives me his final paper , in which he argues that the categorical imperative is perhaps too uncompromising to deal with the conflict that affects our everyday and challenges me to tell him whether therefore we are condemned to moral failure , i say , " i don 't know .
so we decided , a bit fed-up with this world and also with the strong feeling in our stomach that this wasn 't sustainable , to found a financial services firm based on our values , and we decided to incorporate feminine values into the world of finance .
so we like to see profits , plus positive social and environmental benefits , when we invest .
women in iceland took the day off .
but this story doesn 't start with robotics at all , it starts with animation .
but i found that robots didn 't move at all in this engaging way that i was used to for my animation studies .
it was after a passover seder .
but the real revelation was when i learned about method acting .
and it 's a little bit like what you might see actors do when they try to mirror each other to find the right synchrony between them .
it only did what it was supposed to do and nothing more .
being a musician is not just about making notes , otherwise nobody would ever go see a live show .
and we had this rapper come in and do a little jam with the robot .
i think one of the reasons i care so much about robots that use their body to communicate and use their body to move -- and i 'm going to let you in on a little secret we roboticists are hiding -- is that every one of you is going to be living with a robot at some point in their life .
don 't be ashamed .
so many of these devices really kind of focus on the ways in which we relate to ourselves .
and so this really shifts the human / plant dynamic , because a single house plant can actually express its needs to thousands of people at the same time .
and so this is constructed out of a heat reflected material that serves to mediate the difference in temperature between the human body and the glacial ice .
i 'm really troubled by that . but anyway that 's -- the basis of the thing that i want to share with you today , though , is that right back to where we inspire people who will be our great leaders later .
if you look at what happened -- this little black line is as fast as man ever flew , and the red line is top-of-the-line military fighters and the blue line is commercial air transport .
here 's the biggie , and that is , you don 't have innovation cycles if the government develops and the government uses it .
it 'll be very high volume ; we think 100,000 people will fly by 2020 .
paul allen , elan musk , richard branson , jeff bezos , the ansari family , which is now funding the russians ' sub-orbital thing , bob bigelow , a private space station , and carmack .
well , again , what 's interesting here is we 've lost to the russians on the first couple of milestones already .
ok , thank you very much .
so we have these stars going around in circles like this .
but that cannot account for the mass either .
is there any other ray of light that could make into the observer 's eye from that galaxy ?
and so the next thing you need to do in your experiment is grab a napkin . i grabbed a piece of graph paper -- i 'm a physicist .
ok , so , a quick review then , to see that you 're following .
the startling answer to this question , ok , from these experiments , was that space is expanding at a faster rate today than it was a few billion years ago , ok .
now , what do i mean by well motivated ?
the big questions facing physics .
and what we want to do as neuroscientists in this time is to actually listen to these symphonies , these brain symphonies , and try to extract from them the messages they carry .
she played the game without moving her body .
so what you see here is this is the design of the task .
how far can we take it ?
and i can only tell you that as a scientist , i grew up in southern brazil in the mid- ' 60s watching a few crazy guys telling [ us ] that they would go to the moon .
it starts of with the very small ones , which are one carbon , four hydrogen -- that 's methane -- it just floats off .
for the first time , american consumers will kind of see the oil supply chain in front of themselves .
i mean , we 're angry at the one hand and we want to be somewhere else .
and it also the kind of root of how we see oil as a conspiracy .
when the santa barbara spill happened in 1969 , it formed the environmental movement in its modern form .
one of the things that 's happened because of this is that , since 1969 , the country of nigeria , or the part of nigeria that pumps oil , which is the delta -- which is two times the size of maryland -- has had thousands of oil spills a year .
that was the beginning of an escalating u.s. involvement there that we do not pay for at the pump .
one of the things that we also need to do , is we need to try to not kind of fool ourselves into thinking that you can have a green world , before you reduce the amount of oil that we use .
let me give you a little sense of how this would work .
nobody really did anything with it , pretty much .
but then -- ok , when ted started , there was no web so things like " click " didn 't have the same meaning .
there is still a huge frustration that people have because we haven 't got data on the web as data .
all kinds of conceptual things , they have names now that start with http .
and , pretty soon chris bizer at the freie universitat in berlin who was one of the first people to put interesting things up , he noticed that wikipedia -- you know wikipedia , the online encyclopedia with lots and lots of interesting documents in it .
i can use it in my company .
and it 's not just governments , of course -- it 's enterprises as well .
you say , " this photograph , it 's about -- it depicts this person . " bing ! that 's data . data , data , data .
and we 've practiced that .
various diseases thrive in this environment , the most drastic of which is called trachoma .
anyway , we realized that we could save 80 million liters of water on average each time they skipped a bath , and also we would save two hours a day for kids who are in rural areas , two hours more for school , two hours more for homework , two hours more to just be a kid .
they radiate happiness . you are surprised .
now the key to all this is that we cannot only experience this once in a while .
certainly not .
how can we do it ?
you open your ears . you open your nose .
a grateful world is a world of joyful people .
the loudest sound you can hear is a trillion times more powerful than that .
noise kills 200,000 people a year in europe .
ten million americans already have this for one reason or another , but really worryingly , 16 percent -- roughly one in six -- of american teenagers suffer from noise-induced hearing disorder as a result of headphone abuse .
i 'm going to just run quickly through eight modalities , eight ways sound can improve health .
protect your ears ? yes , absolutely .
the epa estimates , in the united states , by volume , this material occupies 25 percent of our landfills .
but nature provides us with a really good model here .
if you 're in northern europe or north america , you can use things like buckwheat husks or oat hulls .
the last step , of course , is application .
when this is combined with the loss of manufacturing jobs to china , it has , you know , led to considerable angst amongst the western populations .
it turned out , in every single case , they came out of the indian educational system .
interestingly , what he finds is — and by the way , the way we look at the quality of a patent is what we call forward citations : how many times does a future patent reference the older patent ? — he finds something very interesting .
without that , you could not have any of the other invisible innovations today .
here is the profile of employees of ibm over the last decade .
i understand that humans are so " messed up " -- to use a nice word , because i promised my mom i 'd stop using the f-bomb in public .
it is using our money for all of those things .
but i talked to her for a range of issues .
but if they were together planting trees for the environment , it was okay -- creativity .
one of the things that made this campaign work is because we grew from two ngos to thousands in 90 countries around the world , working together in common cause to ban landmines .
so i 'd like to spend a little bit of time this afternoon and tell you a little bit about our process for fixing the city , a little bit about detroit , and i want to do that through the voices of detroiters .
they can also see vacant property .
three key imperatives were really important to our work .
and i was left with this intense feeling of awe and exhilaration at the universe and our own ability to understand as much as we do .
this is one of the largest underground labs in the world .
so this is the russians working on the ice in the peak of the siberian winter .
and one piece of engineering that i want to leave you with as regards this telescope is the mirror .
this hut was built by robert falcon scott and his men when they first came to antarctica on their first expedition to go to the south pole .
and if they have to pack it back , they have to put it into boxes and stamp on it so that it fits into the box again -- except , when they did it first , it would have been done in texas .
thank you .
and so two months later , we found ourselves " at large " -- myself , 10 juvenile inmates and a wonderful fellow named russ , who became a very good friend of mine and my partner in this project .
well , that 's a problem because one way or another , you have to get this guy moving because it 's getting dark soon and dangerous .
and he spent the last 10 years of his life in two places only , the slums and the state prison , where he spent the last two years before he ended up sitting on this rock there .
you know , perspective is one of these critically important life-coping strategies that mountain biking can really teach you .
this was the first place where we got some water and supplies . "
you should be really afraid that -- if we stick up the first slide on this thing -- there we go -- that you 're missing out .
that is one of the reasons why aids is raging across africa as fast as it is , and not as fast across europe .
because if you can live in radiation that looks like this , that brings up a whole series of interesting questions .
they can 't do it naturally , so what they do with this thing is they take a spoon , take some cells out of an adult gar 's mouth , code , take the cells from that and insert it into a fertilized cow 's egg , reprogram cow 's egg -- different gene code .
the really neat thing about this stuff is that 's life .
not so in human beings : you cut off an arm , you cut off a leg -- it doesn 't regrow .
you can make very small changes in gene code and get really different outcomes , even with the same string of letters .
except that when you lay that side by side with the speed with which gene data 's being deposited in genbank , moore 's law is right here : it 's the blue line .
what 's the net effect of this ?
oh , yeah , and it takes about 5.6 million indians .
just a few minutes ago , i took this picture about 10 blocks from here .
what 's the kind of environmental -- what is the space of creativity ?
the problem is , if you buy a $ 40,000 incubator , and you send it off to a mid-sized village in africa , it will work great for a year or two years , and then something will go wrong and it will break , and it will remain broken forever , because you don 't have a whole system of spare parts , and you don 't have the on-the-ground expertise to fix this $ 40,000 piece of equipment .
this is a statue from oxford .
but in fact , if you go back and look at the historical record , it turns out that a lot of important ideas have very long incubation periods -- i call this the " slow hunch . "
but that 's a key thing .
it was right at 20 mhz , so you could pick it up really easily , because they were afraid that people would think it was a hoax , basically .
and they thought about it and they said , " well , i guess maybe you could . let 's run the numbers here . "
but i would say no .
the device is completely portable , and can be ...
so that 's where we 're at so far in developing this sixth sense that would give us seamless access to all this relevant information about the things that we may come across .
they are scarce ; they are expensive ; and we only have a certain range of it .
x-rays , useful when you go to hospitals .
go to the main floor , you see these light bulbs .
what we 've done is we have also developed a demonstrator .
but let me do this .
if the whole world would deploy them , you would save hundreds of power plants .
but i can give you a few examples .
thank you .
and i propose to bring into this ted conference , as i always do around the world , the voice of the animal kingdom .
and her concentration -- she 's already concentrated hard for 20 minutes or so , and now she wants to do it all over again , just for the satisfaction of having done it better .
they can actually live longer than 60 in captivity , so we 've only done 40 years in the wild so far .
this means that although for hundreds , perhaps thousands of years , people have lived in those forests , or whatever habitat it is , in harmony with their world , just killing the animals they need for themselves and their families -- now , suddenly , because of the roads , the hunters can go in from the towns .
and we are abusing this great power we have to be wise stewards , and we 're destroying the world .
i feel this deep shame , and that 's why in 1991 in tanzania , i started a program that 's called roots and shoots .
we 're in every state now , and the problems in florida are different from the problems in new york .
violence leads to violence , at least in my view .
secondly , the resilience of nature .
now , inspired by jill bolte taylor last year , i didn 't bring a human brain , but i did bring a liter of bone marrow .
and we have a flexible , powered catheter with a special wire loop tip that stays inside the crunchy part of the marrow and follows the contours of the hip , as it moves around .
we 've just come out , we 're commercializing , this year , generation 2.0 of the marrow miner .
now i 've been working on this for a long time .
one : consciousness does not exist .
we 're not ready for a scientific definition , but here 's a common-sense definition .
you see , the distinction between reality and illusion is the distinction between how things consciously seem to us and how they really are .
i gave you a scientific demonstration by raising my hand , but how is that possible ?
we know that actual human consciousness has something more than that .
but we have this persistent confusion between objectivity and subjectivity as features of reality and objectivity and subjectivity as features of claims .
so these are my illusion glasses .
voice : marco , i did not know you could do that .
well , to this , i just say , no no .
and the secret is she opens every single one .
and yeah , we 're there .
and they found things like , when you see crystal meth on the street , if you add police presence , you can curb the otherwise inevitable spate of assaults and robberies that would happen .
so to compensate , i 'd hold the pen tighter , and this progressively made the shake worse , so i 'd hold the pen tighter still .
but i sat there for hours , and nothing came to mind .
their stories became the art as i wrote them onto the revolving canvas .
and what if i didn 't embrace the shake ?
and this is true both of my recent project on sex differences in the brain , and my more mature work on the anatomy and function of penises .
most of the time it 's a flexible organ .
and no one had systematically looked at the wall tissue .
it lengthens , shortens and bends really easily in response to internal or external forces .
so it 'll be made of the same cotton cloth , same balloon , same internal pressure .
yeah . me too .
you can see why this study freaked me out .
we are going to have to start all over again .
and this is really what the new science of stress reveals , that how you think about stress matters .
it 's a stress hormone .
and then they used public records for the next five years to find out who died .
thank you so much , kelly . it 's pretty cool . km : thank you .
in england the upper middle classes have actually solved this problem perfectly , because they 've re-branded unemployment .
i 'm probably in the wrong country to talk about willingness to pay tax .
for maybe 10 percent of the money , you could have paid all of the world 's top male and female supermodels to walk up and down the train handing out free chateau petrus to all the passengers .
you 're 200 yards away , you realize you 've got five seconds to go , you floor it .
this is my suggestion for getting people to finish their course of antibiotics .
actually my pain experienced in paying five pounds is not just proportionate to the amount , but where i think that money is going .
he referred actually to strange economists called the french physiocrats , who believed that the only true value was what you extracted from the land .
i would argue , in britain there 's a much better frame of reference , which is to tell people that more first-class mail arrives the next day in the u.k. than in germany .
i was born in strasbourg , france to turkish parents .
we 're born into a certain family , nation , class .
so from the very beginning , fiction for me was less of an autobiographical manifestation than a transcendental journey into other lives , other possibilities .
i was in istanbul when the earthquake hit in 1999 .
at this stage , my grandmother , who had been watching the course of my life with increasing anxiety , started to include in her daily prayers that i urgently get married so that i could settle down once and for all .
what i experienced as a child in that school in madrid is happening in the literary world today .
but there were times when i wanted to remind both sides that this was fiction .
when palestinian and israeli politicians talk , they usually don 't listen to each other , but a palestinian reader still reads a novel by a jewish author , and vice versa , connecting and empathizing with the narrator .
but my point is perhaps that elusive space is what writers and artists need most .
i 'm not connecting to them .
so it 's the first thing i do is , i do my own curation .
and i thought , well , what is that relationship ?
and if you 've seen vermeer 's paintings before , you know that they 're incredibly calm and quiet .
she 's wearing his wife 's pearl earring .
and that lack of resolution , the lack of resolution in " girl with a pearl earring " -- we don 't know if she 's happy or sad .
and i thought , if i 'm going to make a story , what 's the last thing i 'm going to put in there ?
he should not have been surprised .
i think i 'm ready to do my thing i think i 'm ready to take my chances i 've been dining out and all stressed out due to the circumstances . see ? i gotta get up , get up , get up , get up wake up , wake up , wake up , wake up i see what you 're saying we sent a demo to the world , they said it sounds like take 6 i said " hold on , wait a minute , i 'll be back with the remix " they looking at us funny , we can 't make any money it took us years to figure out that we was dealing with dummies they didn 't understand the sound from the bronx , that 's the boogie down to huntsville , alabama , there 's no circles in my planner , so it was time to make the product , so we hooked up with townsend made a deal with john neal , on the road sold ten thousand wba , that means a trip to nashville festplatte showed up and said them boys are naturals can you hear what they were hearing ? see what they were seeing ? from bronx to berlin , we took the tour european all vocal yeah , we widit , call the album " what is it ?

time after time , whenever i set out to share some great truth with a soon-to-be grateful recipient , it had the opposite effect .
here was a palin impersonator quoting palin word for word .
now let me give you an example from my act .
comedy has been crossing country with remarkable speed way before the internet , social media , even cable tv .
you 've got to love that idea .

and i 'm sure , although we can 't see the people in washington , they are in the same position .
ask the chairpersons and ceos of sotheby 's and christie 's .
now this museum is just as important to us as the west .
girl : women ! one word and they get upset .
ladies and gentlemen , thank you very much . shokran .
two of the largest memes that have come out of this site some of you might be familiar with are these lolcats -- just silly pictures of cats with text .
and chris just touched on one of those a second ago , and that was the time 100 poll .
this young man posted a video of him abusing his cat on youtube .
but seriously , this issue on anonymity is -- i mean , you made the case there .
but there were some good things that came out of that too .
cp : i got out of mom 's , and i 'm back in school right now .
for example , in the liver they form channels to detoxify the blood ; in the lung they line air sacs for gas exchange ; in muscle they corkscrew so that muscles can contract without cutting off circulation ; and in nerves they course along like power lines , keeping those nerves alive .
but cancers don 't start out like this .
in effect , when we give cancer patients antiangiogenic therapy -- here , an experimental drug for a glioma , which is a type of brain tumor -- you can see that there are dramatic changes that occur when the tumor is being starved .
and over the course of six months , he experienced a complete remission .
in other words , can we eat to starve cancer ?
now , in the lab , we can simulate tumor angiogenesis represented here in a black bar .
and for many people around the world , dietary cancer prevention may be the only practical solution because not everybody can afford expensive end-stage cancer treatments , but everybody could benefit from a healthy diet based on local , sustainable , antiangiogenic crops .
they 're not exactly in mainstream cancer treatments right now .
the desert was advancing by a mile or two a year .
they 're both technologies . in the end , their similarity is not that interesting .
so what sex does is it enables the individual to draw upon the genetic innovations of the whole species .
oz takes one hour to make a spear and two hours to make an axe .
back in 1800 , you 'd have had to work six hours to earn a candle that could burn for an hour .
they 're in bistros and cafes and restaurants and shops all over paris , and they 're all ready to serve you at an hour 's notice with an excellent meal that 's probably got higher quality than louis xiv even had .
and the beauty of this system is that it benefits both sides .
in the same valley there are modern human remains from about the same date , 30,000 years ago , and some of those are from local chert , but more -- but many of them are made from obsidian from a long way away .
it didn 't happen in tierra del fuego -- similar island , similar people .
it 's completely irrelevant .
well in case you 've ever wondered , this is what the sun sounds like .
so thomas watson wasn 't listening to us .
jansky had made a historic discovery , that celestial objects could emit radio waves as well as light waves .
thanks .
there was a bird that people liked on the east coast called the heath hen .
i started with my wife , ryan phelan , who ran a biotech business called dna direct , and through her , one of her colleagues , george church , one of the leading genetic engineers who turned out to be also obsessed with passenger pigeons and a lot of confidence that methodologies he was working on might actually do the deed .
if you replace those bits with passenger pigeon bits , you 've got the extinct bird back , cooing at you .
so what they 're doing is working with seven breeds of primitive , hardy-looking cattle like that maremmana primitivo on the top there to rebuild , over time , with selective back-breeding , the aurochs .
real falcons out of slightly doctored chickens .
thanks to captive breeding at the san diego zoo , there 's 405 of them now , 226 are out in the wild .
it is a tinker bell moment , because what are people excited about with this ?
now , there 's the shifting baseline problem , which is , so when these things come back , they might replace some birds that are there that people really know and love .
currently , what they were doing is that they were using these small fishing boats , and they were cleaning clean lines in an ocean of dirt .
what 's happening is that , because the boat changes shape , the position of the front sail and the main sail are different to the wind .
now , if you 're taking the same system , and you 're putting vertical , you 're bending , and if you 're moving this way forward , your instinct will tell you that you might go this way , but if you 're moving fast enough , you might create what we call lateral lift , so we could get further or closer to the wind .
this is a proud member of protei from korea , and on the right side , this is a multiple-masts design proposed by a team in mexico .
so that 's what we 're looking for developing .
there is no longer any consistency in the surface signals .
with neutral , there 's nothing in particular that evan needs to do .
but with " disappear , " there 's really no analogies -- so evan , what you want to do here is to imagine the cube slowly fading out , okay .
you know , from the user interface of the control system to opening curtains or closing curtains .
from my seat , i was looking up at a stone town on a hilltop , bright in the noontime sun , when from behind there was a great bang , as loud and violent as a bomb .
abed said that i should call back in a few weeks , and when i did , and a recording told me that his number was disconnected , i let abed and the crash go .
were we instead our bodies , their inborn endowments and deficits ?
i was me , but i was now me despite a limp , and that , i suppose , was what now made me , me .
twenty-one years later , he was now thinner than his wife , his skin slack on his face , and looking at abed looking at his young self , i remembered looking at that photograph of my young self after the crash , and recognized his longing .
some , as had i , would remember .
but it was hard for me to relate to one who had so completely washed his hands of his own calamitous doing , to one whose life was so unexamined that he said he thought two people had died in the crash .
i told him the name of that man .
so that 's how it all started .
and i said , " well i 've been a woman for 60 years , but i 've only been secretary of state for a few minutes . "
so i think that it behooves us -- those of us that live in various countries where we do have economic and political voice -- that we need to help other women .
and we lobbied on behalf of women 's issues .
and all of a sudden we were talking about arms control , and she said , " well i feel we should do this . "
early visions of wireless power actually were thought of by nikola tesla basically about 100 years ago .
do you ever wonder what happens to this stuff ?
what dr. soljacic figured out how to do was separate the coils in a transformer to a greater distance than the size of those transformers using this technology , which is not dissimilar from the way an opera singer shatters a glass on the other side of the room .
mobile electronics .
and if the demo gods are willing , in about 10 seconds or so we should see it .
you know , it 's the latest thing that 's come out .
and for those of you who can 't read it , it says , " it does appear to be some kind of wireless technology . "
but you have it in planets and asteroids .
and if you place a cool gas in front of a hot source , you will see certain patterns which we call absorption lines .
it 's a heavy element produced in thermonuclear explosions of supernovae .
and we found that everything is normal .
it is an amazing tool called astroseismology where we can detect sound waves in the atmospheres of stars .
it 's really difficult .
there can be different ways doing this .
my story actually began when i was four years old and my family moved to a new neighborhood in our hometown of savannah , georgia .
and my doctor , on a whim , sent me to get a full-body bone scan , which showed that there was some growth in my left leg .
i would reach out to six men from all parts of my life and ask them to be present in the passages of my daughters ' lives .
so i wasn 't going to tell her about this idea , but the next day i couldn 't control myself , i told her .
i was like , " cow tipping ?
and as he talked he had that glint in his eye that i first saw back in holland -- the glint that says , " let 's go cow tipping , " even though we never did tip the cow , even though no one tips the cow , even though cows don 't sleep standing up .
and i remember a particular one night that , when you told that story of -- i don 't know where you are dr. nuland -- of william sloane coffin -- it made me think of it .
cancer , i found , is a passport to intimacy .
but like a lot of modern men , he hugs , he bakes , he leaves work early to coach little league .
as my physical therapist likes to say , " every step is a tragedy waiting to happen . "
come the one year anniversary of my journey , i went to see my surgeon , dr. john healey -- and by the way , healey , great name for a doctor .
but i 'll just close what i 've been talking about by leaving you with this message : may you find an excuse to reach out to some long-lost pal , or to that college roommate , or to some person you may have turned away from .
you know , they were marginalized in the negotiation room .
here in galapagos , we 're affected by el ninos and la nina .
it 's a scientific drilling vessel .
this is the part of antarctica that we worry about .
and we saw about 35 alternations between open water and ice-covered water , between gravels and these plant sediments .
it 's about a meter tall pavona clavus colony .
so we have a diamond drill .
then their other attribute is that they have this great chemistry .
this is as messy as it gets .
that is what 's happening right now , and it 's a very different issue than the global warming issue .
that 's the reason that they 're not able to respond or adapt to this rapid acidification that 's going on right now .
and to write a new operating system was not a capricious matter .
one thing you might get is something like the luminous room .
and finally , to pull out all the stops , this is a system called urp , for urban planners , in which we give architects and urban planners back the models that we confiscated when we insisted that they use cad systems .
and the result is sort of gratifyingly perpetual .
and then if it 's time for analysis , we can pull back a little bit and ask for a different distribution .
well , that doesn 't really cut it anymore .
so we have a large number of movies stuck inside here .
can it be for every man , or is this just for corporations and movie producers ?
and i understand what you 're asking .
and he turned to my mother , and he said , " you haven 't told her yet ? "
no labels .
and then i was a masseuse . and then i was a landscape gardener .
but all that belief had fueled me so long .
and do you love what you do , caroline ? "
and i went on a run that i know so well .
and then i remember thinking about that eye specialist asking me , " what do you want to be ? what do you want to be ?
i 'm going to go across india on the back of an elephant .
and i set up kanchi , because my organization was always going to be named after my elephant , because disability is like the elephant in the room .
and if you truly believe -- and i mean believe from the bottom of your heart -- you can make change happen .
and they built beautiful cities all powered on that coal .
and before we know it , they send in the tanks and then send in the troops , and lots of people are dying , and it 's a very , very difficult situation .
you 're arab muslim living in iraq .
poverty , despair , struggle .
that 's odd .
you don 't want americans to die . protect our troops .
it 's a holy war against muslims .
these christians are nuts .
we don 't see it that way in the united states , but you see it that way .
she 's anybody to me .
put yourself in the shoes of the americans who caught them .
why would you use this example of all examples ? "
thank you .
what do we mean by beyond ourselves ?
and this directly translates into my paintings .
i can dodge what i don 't want and pull in what i want .
i was so inspired .
i 've come here to share with you an experiment of how to get rid of one form of human suffering .
a typical day at aravind , we would do about a thousand surgeries , maybe see about 6,000 patients , send out teams into the villages to examine , bring back patients , lots of telemedicine consultations , and , on top of that , do a lot of training , both for doctors and technicians who will become the future staff of aravind .
and yet , why should there be so much variation in quality and in service , and that was the fundamental principle that we followed when we designed the delivery systems .
and how much will they pay for this ?
and , of course , one needs the mindset to be wanting to give away what you have as a surplus .
so , i think it is simple to say just because the u.k. isn 't india the difference is happening .
the radio show is called " the infinite monkey cage . "
if the sun could one day -- and indeed the earth , in fact -- if the earth could read its own astrological , astronomical chart , one day it would say , " not a good day for making plans .
we are all totally recyclable .
that 's the wonderful thing about evolution -- the predilection to believe that our child is best .
i 'm sitting on a train .
you , i imagine , can do much better things with your time .
you can get on your kinect and you can have unicorns dancing and rainbows spraying out of your mobile phone .
it turned into a 24-hour contest .
somebody goes to another country , says , " how fascinating these people are , how interesting their tools are , how curious their culture is . "
and the problem is that a lot of people now , especially adolescents , have to go through two adolescences .
so i started studying anthropology .
they 're not just sitting there .
it wasn 't the resume of breaking this record here , it was more like , who had i become ?
it 's a smiling face .
and i gathered together , honestly , the world 's leading experts in every possible way .
and there 's nothing like swimming for 50 hours in the ocean that gets you thinking about things like this .
and every one of those barbs is sending that venom into this central nervous system .
it was like an icu unit in the water .
well there was no grin and bearing this .
i was swimming with this thing on .
thank you .
i didn 't quit the media lab ; i stepped down as chairman -- which was a kind of ridiculous title , but someone else has taken it on , and one of the things you can do as a professor , is you stay on as a professor .
it didn 't scale but it at least was bringing computers to developing countries , and learning pretty quickly that these kids -- even though english wasn 't their language , the latin alphabet barely was their language , but they could just swim like fish ; they could play these like pianos .
scale is truly important .
and the fun part -- and i 'm quite focused on it -- i tell people i used to be a light bulb , but now i 'm a laser -- i 'm just going to get that thing built , and it turns out it 's not so hard .
now this people ask all the time what it is .
this isn 't a design , ok ?
and yet we count .
you can spray paint it ; you can do anything you want .
so it 's not a matter of whether it 's going to happen . it is going to happen .
we 're told what to wear -- -- and how to do our hair -- -- and how to behave .
but i found my place .
thank you .
and it 's also something that resides in each of us , to close what i think are the two big calamities in the world today .
one of those businesses was a computer rental business called micros on the move , which is very well named , because people kept stealing the computers .
people today we call social entrepreneurs .
one of the lines of encouragement that i heard over and over was , " the streets of hollywood are littered with the carcasses of people like you , who think you 're going to come to this town and make movies . "
and so again , it goes back to betting on good people doing good things .
and we 're also doing a movie called " the kite runner , " based on the book " the kite runner , " also about afghanistan .
i think we have a situation here .
so if a novel can be put into six words and a whole memoir can be put into six words , you don 't need more than six words for a tedtalk .
so for $ 60 , i could summarize a thousand tedtalks into just 600 summaries , which would actually be quite nice .
it 's a huge list .
thank you very much .
in the last 30 years , thanks to explorations in remote parts of the world and advances in technology , biologists have , for example , added a full one-third of the known frog and other amphibian species , to bring the current total to 5,400 , and more continue to pour in .
and i 'd like to show it .
each is exquisitely adapted to the environment in which it lives , interlocked with other species to form ecosystems upon which our own lives depend in ways we have not begun even to imagine .
of the 15 percent evaluated , 20 percent are classified as " in peril , " that is , in danger of extinction .
today , the practicalities of making such an encyclopedia , regardless of the magnitude of the information put into it , are within reach .
that 's the unknown world , and today we 've only explored about 3 percent of what 's out there in the ocean .
disappears right into the background .
one , two , three .
this is a new generation , a new family , which is able to store the winds .
ok . good .
now , another couple of years , and these animals will survive on their own .
as the trevor project says , it gets better .
if you include internet telephony , you might be able to push this number up to six or seven percent , but it 's nowhere near what people tend to estimate .
okay .
so try this out with your friends and acquaintances , if you like . you 'll find that it 's very cool to talk about the world being one , etc .
think of france and the current debate about immigration .
you can do it immediately , right ?
she has left . no ! a big hand .
if a card shark gathers the cards together , immediately when he -- before he deals the card . now , so i think , number three , i have arranged them in a full house .
yes ?
this is a little risky .
yeah , last night i forgot that . that was a mistake .
but you know , i think you are familiar with fractals -- the mandelbrot spirals and all these things .
when i lift the heap , i peek .
excellent .
lg : queen of ? queen of hearts .
but you can relax , because it takes half an hour before it works , so you have plenty of time to see my whole performance .
i think there are lots of -- i don 't know how many -- but 10 , 15 spades in a deck , at least , right ?
yeah ? ok .
if i drop the card face up , like this , you reverse it . zoe : ok .
go ahead . yeah , good . i like the empathy .
maybe i 'll stand up . half .
ok , now .
if -- and then nine , right ?
ladies and gentlemen , lennart green ! lg : okay , thank you .
so now i 'm in a parking lot . basically it 's a tin can , and i 'm basically recreating the launch with fire extinguishers , fire , i have wax that i threw in front of the lens to look like ice , and so basically if you believed any of the stuff that i just showed you , what you were reacting to , what you 're emoting to , is something that 's a total falsehood , and i found that really kind of fascinating .
so i showed him this , and the reaction i got was interesting .
so , when you saw my footage , you were seeing this : basically , a bunch of guys flipping a ship upside down , and the little mir subs are actually about the size of small footballs , and shot in smoke .
it 's about how our brain is tricked into seeing a persistence of vision that creates a motion picture , and one of the things i had to do is , we — sasha baron cohen is a very clever , very smart guy , comedian , wanted to basically do an homage to the kind of the buster keaton sort of slapstick things , and he wanted his leg brace to get caught on a moving train .
and he said , " because no one knows you had anything to do with it . "
the only thing singing today would be the facts , for i have truly embraced by inner nerd .
the number of people living in back-breaking , soul-crushing extreme poverty has declined from 43 percent of the world 's population in 1990 to 33 percent by 2000 and then to 21 percent by 2010 .
for a start , you won 't have to listen to an insufferable little jumped-up jesus like myself .
right now today , in oslo as it happens , oil companies are fighting to keep secret their payments to governments for extracting oil in developing countries .
it 's not going to kill you .
but let 's , sort of , start at the beginning .
and then you 'll hear things like the train , a plane , a car -- so , the commute .
i did these conference calls . i did all this stuff .
there 's five of them , and in order to get to the really deep ones , the really meaningful ones , you have to go through the early ones .
we all have to improve on this sort of thing .
those are the real problems in the modern office today .
what if they 're thinking about something important ?
what can managers do -- enlightened managers , hopefully -- what can they do to make the office a better place for people to work , so it 's not the last resort , but it 's the first resort ?
so maybe it 's every other week , or every week , once a week , afternoons no one can talk to each other .
and i think it 'll all pay off in the end .
and every colony has a name , which is a number , which is painted on a rock . and i go there every year and look for all the colonies that were alive the year before , and figure out which ones have died , and put all the new ones on the map .
so this is the colony founded by a queen the previous summer .
so , with nobody telling anybody what to do , how is it that the colony manages to adjust the numbers of workers performing each task ?
so there 's this whole network of chambers .
so just to reinforce that what you might have thought about ant queens isn 't true -- you know , even if the queen did have the intelligence to send chemical messages through this whole network of chambers to tell the ants outside what to do , there is no way that such messages could make it in time to see the shifts in the allocation of workers that we actually see outside the nest .
so for example , if i make a mess that the nest maintenance workers have to clean up , then i see fewer ants out foraging .
it could be this year , or this year .
and we 've done experiments that show that that 's because the longer an ant stays outside , the more these simple hydrocarbons on its surface change , and so they come to smell different by doing different tasks .
again , i don 't want to say that this kind of haphazard pattern of interactions produces a factory that works with the precision and efficiency of clockwork .
it 's a bad thing that plastic breaks down into smaller little bits , because it 's always still plastic .
recycling -- everybody kind of ends their books about being sustainable and greening with the idea of recycling .
sports mania : deafening crowds , all for one idea -- get the ball in the net .
jw : in latin america , in india , in southeast asia , and most of all in china .
english is the world 's second language .
and of course it 's growing so fast , sometimes there 's growing pains .
some people don 't want to talk about them . i 'm here to talk about them tonight .
yeah , if you go one , two , three -- " i can 't believe you support this regime with your three kisses . "
so my advice to all my middle eastern friends and muslim friends and anyone who looks middle eastern or muslim , so to , you know , indians , and latinos , everyone , if you 're brown -- here 's my advice to my brown friends .
because i had just been in the falkland islands taking pictures of penguins .
the place is 64 square miles .
jo anne and i have just embarked on a project to digitize them all , and we 're going to do a very high-res digitization , first because it 's a way of preserving them .
now , it 's kind of nuts to work on a new nuclear reactor .
i used to work , also while at microsoft , at a leading restaurant in seattle , so i do a lot of cooking .
you know , a lot of people risk their lives in a brief act of heroism , which is kind of cool , but jill has what i call slow heroism .
so , you always find dinosaurs in deserts or badlands , areas that have very little plant growth and have flash floods in the spring .
the study of dinosaurs led to the realization that there 's a problem with asteroid impact , for example .
i said , " well , i think that 's what you call a free willy . "
hahahaha .
ak : it has ears that move passively when the head goes .
bj : so tom gave us a call and said , " do you think you could make us a horse for a show to happen at the national theatre ? "
bj : so we got a camera , and we posed the puppet in various galloping stances .
so here are some half-finished horses ready to be worked in london .
horses ' hearing is very important .
and i would like you to believe that it was an aesthetic choice , that i was making a three-dimensional drawing of a horse that somehow moves in space .
thank you . thank you .
and to my astonishment , when i began seriously studying other traditions , i began to realize that belief -- which we make such a fuss about today -- is only a very recent religious enthusiasm that surfaced only in the west , in about the 17th century .
and this is absolutely crucial to the monotheisms , too .
but , make no mistake about it , religion is a kind of fault line , and when a conflict gets ingrained in a region , religion can get sucked in and become part of the problem . our modernity has been exceedingly violent .
it 's a profound moral matter that engages and should engage us all .
and now , here 's my wish : i wish that you would help with the creation , launch and propagation of a charter for compassion , crafted by a group of inspirational thinkers from the three abrahamic traditions of judaism , christianity and islam , and based on the fundamental principle of the golden rule .
i felt something in this plexus of blood vessels and nerves , and there must be some muscles in there as well somewhere , i guess .
" why ? " and they 'd say , " oh , it feels so natural , " or , " it 's nice . "
and some of the people i speak to that have never seen a movie or been to the theater don 't get it in the same way .
maybe there 's an innocence to it .
the eyebrows are doing this , the eyes are defocused , and the mouth is hanging open .
or the information 's added on at the back , like that little girl 's drawing that i showed you .
but i also know why it 's exquisite to me , because it 's a palimpsest of things .
why would you do that ?
so that 's okay , isn 't it ?
you also may be taking into account the fact that it 's incredibly painful .
it wins or loses at that point .
what i try to pursue now is the emotional functionality of things .
you know , i 'm from brisbane , which is a great city to live in .
all right boys , take it away .
so i read slowly .
yes , it does say that , but in a very specific context : the anticipated conquest of the sanctuary city of mecca where fighting was usually forbidden , and the permission comes hedged about with qualifiers .
it 's not virginity ; it 's fecundity .
and i founded international bridges to justice which has a specific mission of ending torture as an investigative tool and implementing due process rights in the 93 countries by placing trained lawyers at an early stage in police stations and in courtrooms .
or a woman , i picked up her baby , really cute baby , i said " your baby is so cute . "
prosecutors were perfectly trained .
and people often say to me , " you know , this is great , but it 's wildly idealistic .
thank you .
and stewardship 's implicit in dominion , because you can 't be steward of something if you can 't dominate it .
this is what i presented to the white house .
we see the flows of materials in a rather terrifying prospect .
if we look at the world of architecture , we see with mies ' 1928 tower for berlin , the question might be , " well , where 's the sun ? "
and with so much polymer , what we really need is technical nutrition , and to use something as elegant as a tree -- imagine this design assignment : design something that makes oxygen , sequesters carbon , fixes nitrogen , distills water , accrues solar energy as fuel , makes complex sugars and food , creates microclimates , changes colors with the seasons and self-replicates .
then , the question becomes not growth or no growth , but what do you want to grow ?
shoes for nike , where the uppers are polyesters , infinitely recyclable , the bottoms are biodegradable soles .
we did a mass energy balance -- if they use brick , they will lose all their soil and burn all their coal .
we have a 24-hour street , so that there 's always a place that 's alive .
meanwhile , american ingenuity and innovation has helped to spur industrialization and also helped in the creation and the building of things like household appliances such as refrigerators and televisions , motor vehicles and even the mobile phones in your pockets .
and they have also decided to prioritize economic rights over political rights .
however , through a network of state-owned enterprises , the chinese have been able to go into these rural areas , using their companies to help deliver on these healthcare solutions .
the question that is left for us in general is , what then should the west be doing ?
because ultimately , the question before us , and the question before seven billion people on the planet is , how can we create prosperity ?
one of my girlfriends in graduate school , marie , said , " kim , i figured it out .
all right . " starsky and hutch , " arguably , yes .
they 're designed to recover from an injury .
she 's totally not kidding . "
what 's the budget for protective equipment ?
so in the early ' 80s , there was a ban on commercial whaling that came into force as a result of this campaign .
the 200 years of whaling was clearly detrimental and caused a reduction in the populations of whales between 60 to 90 percent .
and i was laughing about this with the very smart colleagues i have , and said , " you know , well , if i have to talk about the future , what is it ? "
took me six years at mit , and about that many pages to describe what i was doing , and it took him one page . and so this is our muse tucker .
these are little mechanical computers .
and that way you can scale things much smaller than microchips .
and literally with only those two inputs -- so , the shape of your boundary condition and the pressure -- you can define an infinite number of lenses that cover the range of human refractive error , from minus 12 to plus eight diopters , up to four diopters of cylinder .
one thing i 'm really interested about this right now is , how , if you 're really taking this view of the universe as a computer , how do we make things in a very general sense , and how might we share the way we make things in a general sense the same way you share open source hardware ?
so this is actually a 3,000-square-foot kite , which also happens to be a minimal energy surface .
the second is basically an entrepreneur who is set up and doing who-knows-what in a table in a market .
now , how simple can you make the production ?
in that particular test , urine either , containing a hormone called hcg , does or does not flow across a piece of paper .
and so i regard that as done .
now , take a look at what a typical test looks like .
this is a fantastic device which is only beginning to be tapped .
so , i think it 's as low-cost as we 're likely to be able to come up and make things .
why doesn 't somebody do it ? and the answer is , " how do you make a profit in a capitalist system , doing that ? "
the u.s. government decided to take action , and forced those patent holders to make their patents available to share with others to enable the production of airplanes .
people who have access to these drugs stop dying .
again , deliberate action is needed .
already , i 'll give you an example .
now the first of those two things that everyone knows is kind of saying that we 're at a very un-typical place , uniquely suited and so on , and the second one is saying that we 're at a typical place .
it 's also very cold out there -- less than three degrees above absolute zero .
so we are a chemical scum that is different . this chemical scum has universality .
and the same -- well , if we could do that we 'd automatically have an energy supply , because the transmutation would be a fusion reactor -- and evidence ?
civilizations end . the overwhelming majority of all species and all civilizations that have ever existed are now history .
so take two stone tablets , and carve on them .
and you don 't necessarily have to have your own tv set .
now you 'd think that " american idol " would introduce a measure of americanization .
and obviously , technology had existed before then , but we weren 't aware of it , and so it was sort of an awakening of this force in our life .
and so the profile is sort of for your average san francisco neighborhood : a lot of young people .
it enabled us to actually eat all kinds of things .
i call this entire thing -- us humans as our technology , everything that we 've made , gadgets in our lives -- we call that the technium . that 's this world .
there is more energy flowing through , per gram per second , than anything that we have any other experience with .
i did a survey of a number of species of artifacts in my house , and there 's 6,000 . other people have come up with 10,000 .
the response to a bad idea -- like , say , a tungsten light bulb -- is a better idea . ok ?
great movement that is starting billions of years ago is moving through us and it continues to go , and our choice , so to speak , in technology , is really to align ourselves with this force much greater than ourselves .
it 's hard to know .
hello there .
it 's actually a children 's song but like so many projects for children it 's really just a trojan horse for adult work .
but at least it 's just a kind of artwork to explore our ideas about a different future .
and my belief is that we will get more and more new materials which we can put into structure later on , because structure is one of the key issues in aircraft design .
and you 've got trillions of them .
then one more beer and it was , whatever happened to the mustache ?
and we sat down , and i shared with him my vision of getting men growing mustaches across australia , raising awareness for this cause , and funds for his organization . and i needed a partnership to legitimately do that .
then in early 2007 , a really interesting thing happened .
and for us , we have redefined charity .
and from that moment i realized that movember is so much more than a mustache , having a joke .
and that 's how we 're redefining the research world .
military collect weapons , and depression stays intact .
so the key here is empathy .
we developed a culturally-sensitive psycho-social counseling approach .
and another counselor said to me after the training , " you know , i never knew why i survived the killings in my village , but now i know , because i am part of a nucleus of a new peaceful society in afghanistan . "
hockey is a game . but really , was this a game ?
and this is actually from his degradation series .
and i thought , that 's it ? and so , you know , this is the middle passage , this is an incredibly significant event , and she 's treating it like , basically some black people went on a cruise , is more or less how it sounds to her .
and so , we made this game , and she got it .
like , here 's the economics of illegal immigration .
and what i came to understand is , we needed to teach children the symbiotic relationship between a healthy planet , healthy food and healthy kids .
and the results of that are kids getting sick .
it really is just a new idea .
because eight-year-olds don 't get to decide -- and if they do , you should be in therapy .
the only working piece of equipment in my kitchen was a can crusher , because if it didn 't come in a can , it came frozen in a box .
there 's a lot of stuff we can do . there 's a lot of schools doing farm-to-school programs . there 's a lot of schools actually getting fresh food into schools .
they do tastings of these ingredients in the gardening classes .
we have recycling in all of our schools .
and then , at one in the afternoon , they 're totally crashing .
the national school lunch program spends 8 billion dollars feeding 30 million children a year .
and those are the same kids who are going to be getting sick .
now i was thinking , how can i make those sound waves visible ?
and it 's got tiny little particles of metal in it , which makes it magnetic .
i can assure you i was fully conscious while i was taking those pictures .
thank you .
or are we on the verge of all being gifted ?
and he asked that particular person , what do crows and fish have in common ?
what color are the bears at the north pole ? "
and you were supposed to think , well , the state legislature was rural-controlled , and they hated the big city , so rather than putting the capital in a big city , they put it in a county seat .
they had to prepare a case to get rating agencies to give it a aaa , though in many cases , they had virtually bribed the rating agencies .
you have to say , imagine you were in iran , and imagine that your relatives all suffered from collateral damage even though they had done no wrong .
if you look at the i.q. test , you find the gains have been greatest in certain areas .
they don 't know who was an ally of america in world war ii .
this is what statisticians technically call a damn fine bet .
it 's because the mind recalls words by their first letter .
we see this on tv ; we read about it in the paper .
how much is this big mac worth ? is it worth 25 dollars ?
this tendency to compare to the past is causing people to pass up the better deal . in other words , a good deal that used to be a great deal is not nearly as good as an awful deal that was once a horrible deal .
the difference is that when you lost the ticket you say to yourself , i 'm not paying twice for the same thing .
these are subjects coming to an experiment to be asked the simplest of all questions : how much will you enjoy eating potato chips one minute from now ?
when you go to buy groceries with it , it doesn 't go , i 'm the money saved on the car stereo , or , i 'm the dumb money saved on the car . it 's money .
all of us , i hope , prefer more money , and the reason is , we believe more is better than less .
at no point will the fireman look taller than the fiddler . no point .
because i could go on for about two hours with evidence of people 's inability to estimate odds and inability to estimate value .
dan , i 'd like to hear more on this . so , you 're saying that our response to terror is , i mean , it 's a form of mental bug ?
i don 't want to say -- please , i 'm going to get quoted somewhere as saying , " terrorism is fine and we shouldn 't be so distressed . "
my guess is that there 's nothing quite that specific in our evolutionary past . but rather , if you 're looking for an evolutionary explanation , you might say that most organisms are neo-phobic -- that is , they 're a little scared of stuff that 's new and different .
now , i think there 's many good reasons not to listen to economists .
and i 'm going to tell you the richard feynman that i knew .
somehow he did .
and without skipping a beat at all , he said , " well , they 'd be about the same .
feynman let them have it -- both barrels , right between the eyes .
but he was convinced of this .
i apologize for the sexist conversation here , but this is the way it really happened .
in the 1950s , people were trying to figure out how superfluid helium worked .
the thing was that that simple thing that he wrote down explained everything that was known at the time about liquid helium and then some .
one loop , two loops -- maybe you could do a three loop diagram , but beyond that , you couldn 't do anything .
how should we really honor feynman ?
and as soon as you 've got that idea , you should immediately wonder : what happens if we widen the differences , or compress them , make the income differences bigger or smaller ?
it contains whether kids can talk to their parents , whether they have books at home , what immunization rates are like , whether there 's bullying at school .
very similar scatter over a similar range of levels of trust .
here we have children dropping out of high school .
the position of women , how closely they keep to the nuclear family , are on opposite ends of the poles in terms of the rich developed world .
you see there that sweden does better than britain all the way across the social hierarchy .
our data source decides whether it 's reliable data , we don 't .
thank you .
i emphasize leather because it is so widely used .
and so i 'm very excited to show you , for the first time , the first batch of our cultured leather , fresh from the lab .
imagine touring this facility , learning about how the leather or meat is cultured , seeing the process from beginning to end , and even trying some .
the equator 's speed is actually about 60 miles per hour .
it 'll be on display at the interactive telecommunications spring show in greenwich village in new york city -- that 's open to the public , definitely invite you all to come and attend -- it 's a fantastic show .
this solution has been called , by some , " potentially the most important medical advance this century . "
but in this case we cracked it , but a big part of the problem still remains .
well , look at some old ways , some ways that we 'd already cracked .
just so you don 't embarrass yourselves , i 'll give you the right answer : it 's increase .
this first challenge is what i refer to as the persuasion challenge .
let 's go back to kindergarten . ok ?
i found a problem , a specific problem that actually found an error with that .
and they say , " you know what ? do i need turbo ? do i need this heavyweight car ? "
you can be safe because when you 're hit , you survive , or you can be safe because you avoid accidents .
here is an innovation , a design innovation .
i think this tells us there is an opportunity .
i mean , it sometimes feels , listening to behavioral economists that they are kind of putting into place academically , what great marketers have sort of intuitively known for a long time .
while that might be a somewhat morbid thought , i think it has some really profound implications that are worth exploring .
death : death can catch you anywhere , anytime , even at the organic .
now in closing , i think what we all need to be thinking about is if we want that to become our reality -- and if so , what it means for a definition of life and everything that comes after it .
and so the thought that i started with was how do you do this , still within the boundary of the science we know today -- no time for science fair , no time for playing around with things or waiting for the magic battery to show up .
a full battery comes on . and you drive on .
just it doesn 't burn . it consumes itself step after step after step .
now even if we get to 40 miles per gallon by 2020 , which is our desire .
i was running , as chris said , to be the ceo of a large software company called sap and then peres said , " well won 't you run this project ? "
and if you really have a long day you can switch , and keep on driving around the island .
by 2015 we would have had at least 250 million new cars even at the pace we 're going at right now .
you have to remember that the world today is bringing in so many cars .
the business model in which the money that is actually coming in , to drive the car -- the minutes , the miles if you want , that you are all familiar with -- subsidize the price of the car , just like cellphones . you 'll pay for the miles .
we have to start thinking about giving kickers to countries that are willing to go to this kind of scale .
and the u.k. had 100 years of economic growth .
and a long time ago -- well , about 40 years ago -- my mom had an exchange student .
it all kind of started that way , but i think that i really realized the power of the image when i first went to the garbage-collecting village in egypt , when i was about 16 . my mother took me there .
and so that 's what really kind of started me off .
i still have that dream .
but it doesn 't make me believe that we 're in world that can live without war yet .
because i believe that film has the ability to take you across borders .
and that you give israel an alibi to carry on ?
i deal with children all the time .
it 's about connecting people through film , getting these independent voices out there .
there isn 't an organization which is connecting the independent voices of the world to get out there , and yet i 'm hearing throughout this conference that the biggest danger in our future is [ lack of ] understanding the other and having mutual respect for the other and crossing borders .
but it would be the day that the world comes together through film , the power of film .
and now , 2012 .
but the key reason why it 's taking off now so fast is because every new advancement of technology increases the efficiency and the social glue of trust to make sharing easier and easier .
it 's brilliant . now , we may laugh , but chris here is actually making up to 5,000 dollars a month running errands around his life .
the difference today is that , with every trade we make , comment we leave , person we flag , badge we earn , we leave a reputation trail of how well we can and can 't be trusted .
it 's only a matter of time before we 'll be able to perform a facebook- or google-like search and see a complete picture of someone 's behaviors in different contexts over time .
now a few months after this site launched , the founders heard about something interesting , and it actually didn 't surprise them .
and yet , when i look at the environment outside , you see how resistant architecture is to change .
but i think these are the necessary oxygen for us to live in buildings , to live in cities , to connect ourselves in a social space .
expressive spaces are not spaces that simply confirm what we already know .
even the mind is emotional .
we realize that the hand has been given us by forces that are beyond our own autonomy .
and i do believe that this interaction with the history , with history that is often very difficult , to grapple with it , to create a position that is beyond our normal expectations and to create a critique .
when we see the same kind of architecture we become immured in that world of those angles , of those lights , of those materials .
critics like the performance to be repeated again and again the same way .
and i think , of course , risk is what underlies the world .
we too often admire those buildings . we think they are beautiful .
this is what we dream about . its individuality , demonstrated in the skyline . it 's resilience .
we now know in fact that technology is our biggest competitor for leisure time .
both reformations were predicated on fractious discussion , internal self-doubt and massive realignment of antiquated business models .
and they are the places where artists who deserve and want to work at a certain scale of resources will find a home .
thank you , and godspeed .
and perhaps most remarkably , at the beginning of the 21st century , really for the first time in modern history , growth extended to almost all parts of the world .
thomas jefferson , i think , really expressed this quite well .
as other countries become richer the demand for these pharmaceuticals is going to increase tremendously .
but the u.s. is losing its idea leadership .
we need a greater demand for ideas -- those larger markets i was talking about earlier -- and a greater supply of ideas for the world .
well let 's take a look . let 's take a look at the great depression .
the world is much better equipped to overcome an increase in the price of oil today , than ever in the past , because of what i 'm talking about .
so as a youngster , i tried to get close to this by drawing airplanes , constantly drawing airplanes .
so it had to be self-righting , and stay up without crashing .
well in 25 years i was mostly putting out pieces of this romance and not getting a lot back in because design on call doesn 't always connect you with a circumstance in which you can produce things of this nature .
and that 's the way i work now .
she said , " oh i love it . "
you can put them down , essentially out of the way .
as i recline , my head says more or less vertical .
but i think , above all , i 'm in awe at their power to motivate , to compel us , to transfix us , like really nothing else we 've ever invented has quite done before .
now if we look at what 's going on in someone 's head when they are being engaged , two quite different processes are occurring .
now , to try and explain this in sort of real terms , i want to talk about a kind of task that might fall to you in so many games .
you find that -- you know , between five and 20 is about the right number for keeping people going .
if they 're real boxes , there 's not much we can do , but in a game we can just say , " right , well .
every time you do something , you get credit ; you get a credit for trying .
the first has to do with memory , that we can find these moments .
this is a player-developed , self-enforcing , voluntary currency , and it 's incredibly sophisticated player behavior .
it 's pretty simple . there are nine , sort of , rules that i discovered after 35 years of rock climbing .
you get to the last pitch . it 's easy .
in the 35 years i 've been a climbing guide and taught on indoor walls , and stuff like that , the most important thing i 've learned was , guys will always try to do pull-ups .
" ma , don 't start ! "
good storytelling is crafting a story that someone wants to listen to .
and in that little southern town , i grew up , and grew up hearing these stories .
but now she was a septuagenarian , she 'd stopped driving .
blithering fucking idiots .
i 've got a white-knuckle grip on the door . you know what i 'm talking about ?
" you weren 't there , don 't start . "
" no , don 't -- why are we here today ?
correct the other direction now , it 's ok .
we 'll wait for the slow ones . ok .
there she is .
i 'm thinking , " accelerator , break . accelerator , break . "
i 'm about to snap like a brittle twig , when suddenly someone taps me on the shoulder .
" what , ma ? "
you get different kinds of psychopaths .
and what i think might happen in these areas of the world , where we have constant violence , you end up having generations of kids that are seeing all this violence .
and that book is very interesting . because it 's about witch trials , and how people thought back then .
on that day , a column of american and afghan troops were making their way through a part of afghanistan to help protect a group of government officials , a group of afghan government officials , who would be meeting with some local village elders .
and they all say the same thing : " because they would have done it for me . "
it could be a new technology that renders your business model obsolete overnight .
the closest analogy i can give to what a great leader is , is like being a parent .
do we have an issue with that ? none at all .
i know many people at the seniormost levels of organizations who are absolutely not leaders .
now , notice that the leader embraces him as an equal .
okay , but we might have missed the real lesson here .
and this leads to the wonderful irony that our languages exist to prevent us from communicating .
but if we look at the fossil record , we see that they made the same hand axe over and over and over again for one million years .
but in fact , it turns out that some time around 200,000 years ago , when our species first arose and acquired social learning , that this was really the beginning of our story , not the end of our story .
language is a piece of social technology for enhancing the benefits of cooperation -- for reaching agreements , for striking deals and for coordinating our activities .
that 's why we build space shuttles and cathedrals while the rest of the world sticks sticks into the ground to extract termites .
they 're far closer together than that . "
now think of the absurdity of this situation .
mark pagel : this is a very good question .
we use four million cups a day on airline flights , and virtually none of them are reused or recycled .
i want to show you some pieces now that are about addiction .
more than 700,000 children in the united states aged 18 and under begin smoking every year .
our cultural joy , our national joy is nowhere to be seen .
but what really threatens humanity ?
now , some of us are old enough to have a small , circular scar on our arms from an inoculation we received as children .
dendritic cells , or macrophages , capture the virus and display pieces of it .
now luckily , that particular virus , although very scary at the time , did not transmit from person to person very easily .
but in the past few months , researchers have also isolated several new broadly neutralizing antibodies from the blood of an hiv infected individual .
now , retro-vaccinology is just one technique within the ambit of so-called rational vaccine design .
viruses only grow in living things , and so it turned out that , for flu , chicken eggs worked really well .
if you lop this off and attach it to the tail of a different bacterium , which creates a vigorous immune response , they 've created a very powerful flu fighter .
thank you very much .
seth , most of us do work where every month , we produce something ; we get that kind of gratification .
well , it 's the relative importance .
this is the envelope , and this is the gondola , the payload .
i don 't know of any other submersible , or even remote , that just takes advantage that this is a three-dimensional space .
this is the first flying machine . this was the first prototype .
we 've been just feet apart . i 'm going back down now . "
but the patent for underwater flight -- karen and i , we were looking at it , some business partners wanted us to patent it -- we weren 't sure about that .
you 're seeing here images of three years , four-year-olds , and five-year-old children who have been trafficked for commercial sexual exploitation .
you have even the middle class sometimes getting trafficked .
and therefore she starts normalizing this exploitation .
we felt , one of the things that these girls had is immense amount of courage .
it 's very nice for discussion , discourse , making films and everything .
because they are also a part of us .
the idea there behind these two pictures is that the chinese government can act above rule of law .
country 1 has more telephones , and country 1 has a longer system of railways .
india is the smaller of the two countries , and yet it had a longer system of railways until the late 1990s .
by that comparison , democracy looks very , very good in terms of economic growth .
it turns out even during the cultural revolution , china out-perfomed india in terms of gdp growth by an average of about 2.2 percent every year in terms of per capita gdp .
if you cannot chose your nationality , then you will want to become an indian man .
actually , the answer is more nuanced and subtle than that .
why do many people believe that india is still a growth disaster ?
thank you very much .
so think about , this is in your brain .
this is an mr suite with a focused ultrasound system .
this is the sort of general area of the treatment .
the temperature was raised to 43 degrees c temporarily .
and he also plays golf , like you do in virginia when you are retired .
he had to sit on a cushion , stand still , not move , because it was very painful .
and we have better-than-surgery results in breasts .
so in conclusion , i 'd like to leave you with actually four messages .
but the top story of this past year was the economy , and i 'm just betting that , sooner or later , this particular recession is going to be old news .
my point is this : in the long run , some news stories are more important than others .
how clever would we have to be ?
it does this in a couple of ways -- chasing productivity , which drives down prices and encourages us to buy more stuff .
the savings ratio , net savings , were below zero in the middle of 2008 , just before the crash .
it was a sunday evening , sunday afternoon , and it was just after -- actually , to be honest , too long after -- we had moved into a new house .
and these tensions have deep evolutionary roots , so selfish behavior is adaptive in certain circumstances -- fight or flight .
so we can do that here -- we can just put in a little search term .
it has social and psychological aims -- family , friendship , commitments , society , participating in the life of that society .
while they 're taking the podium away , just a quick question .
tim , thank you for a very important talk . thank you .
i don 't know if he really meant [ that ] , but it happened .
why i said this , is the background .
so i 'm going to move on .
they said , " yes . " i said , " all right , let 's pray . "
i want to show you some moments of history in my journey , which probably you would never ever get to see anywhere in the world .
this was a sensitive box .
i remember standing on the roof of the ministry of justice in downtown port-au-prince .
we didn 't want to shout ; we needed to listen as well .
the grassroots has been strengthened through the social power of sharing and they are challenging the old models , the old analog models of control and command .
in mongolia for instance , where 30 percent of the people are nomadic , sms information systems are being used to track migration and weather patterns .
the possibilities that new digital technologies are bringing can help humanitarian organizations , not only ensure that people 's right to information is met , or that they have their right to communicate , but i think in the future , humanitarian organizations will also have to anticipate the right for people to access critical communication technologies in order to ensure that their voices are heard , that they 're truly participating , that they 're truly empowered in the humanitarian world .
and the meme-ome , you know , quite simply , is the mathematics that underlies an idea , and we can do some pretty interesting analysis with it , which i want to share with you now .
so you 've got food economy and local food at the top , you 've got greenhouse gases , solar and nuclear waste .
and i hate that . how do we bubble stuff up to the surface that 's maybe really creative and interesting ?
we 've got ourselves in a world that 's massively complex , and we 've been using algorithms to kind of filter it down so we can navigate through it .
i then went on to make more comments on the media and press imagery , so i started making reference to media imagery -- made it grainy , shot through doorways and so on and so forth -- to titillate the public or the viewer further in terms of trying to make the viewer more aware of their own voyeurism .
so , these are broadsheets , tabloids , debates were being had all about this work , films were being banned before people had actually had the look at the work , politicians were getting involved -- all sorts of things -- great headlines .
so , all this work is getting shown in art galleries .
so i made sure the work was not compromised in any way and that the integrity of the work remained the same .
for example , george bush target practice -- shooting at bin laden and michael moore .
and , you know , i wrote a book . so i 'll say something -- -- i 'll say a little about , you know , how the discovery was made , and why francis and i found it .
and so i applied to caltech and they turned me down .
i went there without knowing him . he was 35 . i was 23 .
he 'll build a model , and then we 're going to be scooped .
well , of course , i wanted to build models .
so in a sense , it is a sort of digital-type information .
and on both occasions , you know , one of us was missing the tie .
and you can see on the top that cancers which are bad show insertions or deletions .
i think it will cost at least 10 to 20 before you 'd be in a position to help parents who 've had an autistic child , or think they may have an autistic child , and can we spot the difference ?
those trying to employ them think they don 't know enough .
and in particular , why are we teaching them math in general ?
now here 's the crazy thing right now .
so we better be damn sure -- and by the way , they didn 't even have fun doing it , most of them -- so we better be damn sure that we know why we 're doing that and it has a real purpose .
you shouldn 't use the machine until you get the basics of the subject .
so another one that comes up is " computers dumb math down . "
they 're not just simple , dumbed-down things that we see in school math .
and experience of harder problems -- being able to play with the math , interact with it , feel it .
and one of the reasons it 's so important -- so it 's very important to get computers in exams .
let 's go for it , and while we 're about it , let 's have a bit of fun , for us , for the students and for ted here .
there 's no ras , no myc , no p53 drug .
we just started mailing it to our friends .
and he obliged us .
leukemia cells treated with this compound turn into normal white blood cells .
the first is if anything is unique about this research , it 's less the science than the strategy -- that this for us was a social experiment , an experiment in what would happen if we were as open and honest at the earliest phase of discovery chemistry research as we could be .
anyone who 's followed politics can testify to how hard that is for some people to get .
on the other hand , 15 month-olds would stare at her for a long time if she acted as if she liked the broccoli , like they couldn 't figure this out .
and chickens and ducks and geese and turkeys are basically as dumb as dumps .
so you don 't want to have the mastodon charging at you and be saying to yourself , " a slingshot or maybe a spear might work . which would actually be better ? "
and what bayes showed was a mathematical way that you could do that .
and sure enough , the four year-olds used the evidence to wave the object on top of the detector .
i don 't know .
what 's it like to be one of these brilliant butterflies who can test five hypotheses in two minutes ?
and what happens then is not that our consciousness contracts , it expands , so that those three days in paris seem to be more full of consciousness and experience than all the months of being a walking , talking , faculty meeting-attending zombie back home .
but we 're going to first enter through the door of the big top .
and yet , how did it start ?
these are all the prototypes . these are the mistakes , although i don 't think mistakes is the right word in design .
its early version had an " x " base . that 's what the collectors like .
charles used to say , " the extent to which you have a design style is the extent to which you have not solved the design problem . "
and i think part of that is that they never delegated understanding .
lucia angel , okay , eye .
those plaques are plaques we 've been installing around north america .
but now i 'm going to return you to the real world .
and i 've shown you some of the images . i just want to focus on sound now .
and part of why this stuff is important and all the things that we do are important , is that these are the ideas we need .
gravity is also a field of forces that act on masses .
what we see is that the cells will attempt to divide for several hours .
in that time , novocure 's developed two systems -- one system for cancers in the head and another system for cancers in the trunk of the body .
and five years ago , robert was diagnosed with gbm .
and the therapy is delivered continuously at home , without having to go into the hospital either periodically or continually .
three years ago , she entered the novocure lung cancer trial .
stefan von bergen : well he turns by just putting his head on one or the other side .
commentator : there he is .
you have no machine around you .
what kind of training do you do , you personally , for that ?
so just check before it 's finished .
and then i did open my chute .
that 's my ejection seat .
have you ever seen tandem birds ?
the first quote is from jean-claude trichet when he was governor of the european central bank .
so these are systems which are made up of many interconnected or interacting parts : swarms of birds or fish , ant colonies , ecosystems , brains , financial markets .
similar data has been around for quite some time .
these are companies that operate in more than one country , and we found 43,000 .
this allowed us to assign a degree of influence to each shareholder .
so you should take the exact numbers in our study with a grain of salt , yet it " gave us a tantalizing glimpse of a brave new world of finance . "
i went back to my bed , and i prayed , and i secretly thanked god that that missile did not land on my family 's home , that it did not kill my family that night .
it is very scary to go through that feeling of " i am about to die " or " i could die in this explosion . "
how interesting .
there is a side that thinks that peace is the end of fighting , and there is a side that thinks that peace is the arrival of schools and jobs .
a congolese woman , who was telling me about how her children saw their father killed in front of them and saw her raped in front of them and mutilated in front of them , and her children saw their nine-year-old sibling killed in front of them , how they 're doing okay right now .
i humbly add -- humbly add -- that out beyond the worlds of war and peace , there is a field , and there are many women and men [ who ] are meeting there .
but if you look at the blue data points , which is mechanically ventilated air , it 's not as diverse .
and what we ultimately want to do is to be able to use this concept to promote a healthy group of microorganisms inside .
let 's start by asking who 's doing well .
if today 's average teacher could become as good as those teachers , our students would be blowing away the rest of the world .
turn to somebody next to you .
i 'll see you later .
thank you .
and it is a body that has long intrigued people who 've watched the planets .
as i said , it has a thick , extensive atmosphere .
and , in this case , it was a massive undertaking to explore a planet , and to come to understand a planetary system that , for all of human history , had been unreachable , and now humans had actually touched it .
and here is the horizon , ok ?
and so now we go onto enceladus . enceladus is a small moon , it 's about a tenth the size of titan . and you can see it here next to england , just to show you the size . this is not meant to be a threat .
well , we on cassini have taken an equivalent first , a picture that no human eye has ever seen before .
except , for many of those years , i 've had to carry around this funny little pink card with green lines running through my face identifying me as a permanent alien .
and in so many ways , i think this is a terrific liberation .
they move to new york city .
but my friend assured me that he wasn 't catholic , nor were most of his students , but he took his classes there every spring .
i just took walks along the monastery road and sent postcards to loved ones .
i started thinking about my father and my grandfather and my great-grandfather , and i realized that i had all of these teds going through my blood stream -- -- that i had to consider this " my element . "
it 's a wonderful organization of people and doctors who go to developing nations to offer plastic surgery to those who need it .
and i said to my husband , i said , " ben , can i buy a banjo ? " and he 's like , " no . "
and i started to kill my blog slowly .
pictures were taken every day : day one , day two ...
you know , we 're getting into china , we want to be there , but you know , there are so many people who won 't have the access to write a blog .
another photo that has greatly influenced me , or a series of photos , is this project that 's done by an argentinean man and his wife .
and she was writing one day , and , you know , then she disappeared for a little bit .
lips are not lips , but volcanoes .
second step , conceptual synesthesia .
what you need to do here is identify as quickly as possible the color of the ink in which these words are printed .
if , for example , house prices are routinely described as climbing and climbing , higher and higher , people might naturally assume that that rise is unstoppable .
but you just have to look at the words around you and you 'll find it .
yes . i 'm sure ! just change it !
these are some of the names that they have chosen , ladies and gentlemen .
now , we 're going to be going to mars one day . and when we do , it 's going to be unfair for the people that are living there to have to live with these ridiculous names .
" now , frank is this clear to you , djabran fluctus ? "
must have been a very interesting day in the shoemaker house .
which a lot of you are like , " how did he figure that out ? "
it doesn 't plug in to what they suspected a flat universe would be .
and copernicus looks like johnny carson , which is really weird .
this is again , indicating how numbers relate to space relate to form , maps of the universe .
just a tip , if you 're being photographed for press pictures , don 't touch your teeth .
that was the first chart i came up with .
that just doesn 't fall out of a tree , ladies and gentlemen .
they start looking like planets .
what does the world want to do together ?
but , of course , since then , the web and mobile telephony , along with ubiquitous reality tv formats have spread all around the world .
this openness , this forcing openness , is key , and if it wasn 't entirely transparent already , i should be open : i 've got a completely transparent agenda .
jamie drummond : fewer children every day .
because i really believe that we 're never more beautiful than when we 're most ugly .
she came out to california , to los angeles , to visit me , and we went to malibu , which she thought was very disappointing .
at every single refugee camp , she has to face off soldiers who want to take my elder brother mark , who was nine , and make him a boy soldier .
their humanity never seems to matter very much to us .
just know that it is enough sometimes to know that it is difficult . "
and when he got tired of reading them , he started to teach the men in death row how to read , with these comic books .
it doesn 't require a tremendous thing .
basically all that means is that the democratic front page is the best stuff on the web . you find some interesting content , say a tedtalk , submit it to reddit , and the community of your peers will vote it up if they like it , vote it down if they don 't .
and it wasn 't long before other sites like fark and boing boing and the rest of the internet started saying , " yes ! we love splashy pants . "
they even created an e-card so you could send your friend a dancing splashy .
i think i 'll start out and just talk a little bit about what exactly autism is .
this feed yard was going to tear down their whole veterinary facility ; all they needed to do was move the flag .
and they just kind of come up , kind of like this .
and my great big internet trunk line is twice as big as the control 's .
but sensory is an issue . some kids are bothered by fluorescent lights ; others have problems with sound sensitivity .
or do i have something wrong with the equipment ? "
now , the thing is , the world is going to need all of the different kinds of minds to work together .
now , van gogh doesn 't know anything about physics , but i think it 's very interesting that there was some work done to show that this eddy pattern in this painting followed a statistical model of turbulence , which brings up the whole interesting idea of maybe some of this mathematical patterns is in our own head .
the thing about the autistic mind is it tends to be fixated .
and it doesn 't matter if what they teach them is old , because what you 're doing is you 're lighting the spark .
tg : well , first of all , you 've got to look at age .
it 's worked really well . i get satisfaction out of seeing stuff that makes real change in the real world . we need a lot more of that , and a lot less abstract stuff .
so purple is " fighting , " and red is " giving money away , " and green is " profiteering . "
so i want to show you another landscape now .
why ?
can you guess what this data set is ?
i started as a programmer , and then i worked as a writer for many years , about 20 years , in print , online and then in advertising , and only recently have i started designing .
and that little square in the corner , a naught .7 percent , that 's the amount we 're actually aware of .
so its military budget is bound to be enormous .
i 'm a bit of a health nut .
so heart is filtered out , so i can see if i 'm curious about that .
so , just to wrap up , i wanted to say that it feels to me that design is about solving problems and providing elegant solutions , and information design is about solving information problems .
and in the egyptian revolution , the revolution 2.0 , everyone has contributed something , small or big . they contributed something -- to bring us one of the most inspiring stories in the history of mankind when it comes to revolutions .
there are a lot of people who are frustrated . "
people did not believe this .
but actually when people went to the street -- the first time it was thousands of people in alexandria -- it felt like -- it was amazing . it was great because it connected people from the virtual world , bringing them to the real world , sharing the same dream , the same frustration , the same anger , the same desire for freedom .
but they detained me .
i said that , " we are going to win .
i love doing this work , because it really gives many people new hope and new choices that they didn 't have before , and it allows us to talk about things that -- not just diet , but that happiness is not -- we 're talking about the pursuit of happiness , but when you really look at all the spiritual traditions , what aldous huxley called the " perennial wisdom , " when you get past the named and forms and rituals that really divide people , it 's really about -- our nature is to be happy ; our nature is to be peaceful , our nature is to be healthy .
huge differences can occur without drugs , without surgery .
and what doesn 't work is fear of dying , and that 's what 's normally used .
your sexual function improves .
and fat has nine calories per gram , whereas protein and carbs only have four .
three grams a day . they come in one-gram capsules ; more than that just gives you extra fat you don 't need .
so , there are lots of reasons for eating this way that go beyond just your health .
it can be sexual intimacy – i happen to think that healing energy and erotic energy are just different forms of the same thing .
whatever life throws at us , whether it 's cancer , diabetes , heart disease , or even broken bones , we want to try and get better .
we 're actually actively looking for materials that will be bioactive , that will interact with the body , and that furthermore we can put in the body , they 'll have their function , and then they 'll dissolve away over time .
so what we were thinking is , there 's a tremendous need for bone repair , of course , but this iliac crest-type approach really has a lot of limitations to it , and could we perhaps recreate the generation of bone within the body on demand and then be able to transplant it without these very , very painful aftereffects that you would have with the iliac crest harvest ?
now , at the time that we did this , this received a lot of attention in the press , because it was a really nice way of generating new bone , and we got many , many contacts from different people that were interested in using this .
but the pores are actually oftentimes much bigger than the cells , and so even though it 's 3d , the cell might see it more as a slightly curved surface , and that 's a little bit unnatural .
what are the challenges in getting value for money as well as value for many ?
i struggled to [ unclear ] day was a huge issue .
for example , how we started : ratan just began with a five-engineer team , young people in their mid-twenties .
imagine that a fellow who sells cloth , for example , will be selling nano .
and those dreams are getting fulfilled .
and they climb up for their work .
and therefore time took notice of this 28-dollar foot , basically .
1,000-dollar antibody injections under the skin , by the way , and 20 of them .
he is giving us not just for psoriasis , for cancer and a whole range of things , changing the whole paradigm .
you 're talking about inclusive innovation .
the message , the final message , is this : india gave a great gift to the world .
but then he held it for a little while , lakshmi .
that was the lesson . that was the inspirational moment .
an intransitive verb , such as " dine , " for example , can 't take a direct object .
how are these construals reflected in language ?
it 's exactly the same construction , but no muffins , no mice , nothing moving at all .
this kind of indirect speech is rampant in language .
if two friends have a reciprocal transaction , like selling a car , it 's well known that this can be a source of tension or awkwardness .
if the officer is honest , you get a huge penalty of being arrested for bribery .
for 4,000 years , we fished sustainably for this animal , and it 's evidenced in the art that we see from thousands of years ago .
and if it 's tunas you don 't care about , perhaps you might be interested that international long lines and pursing chase down tunas and bycatch animals such as leatherbacks , sharks , marlin , albatross .
and for the first time , we 're able to watch the journey of a tuna beneath the ocean using light and photons to measure sunrise and sunset .
so take a look at that animal .
and so what we get then from the pop-up satellite tag is we get away from having to have a human interaction to recapture the tag .
they 're coming together . that could be tuna sex -- and there it is .
it 's a free swimming shark with a satellite tag jumping after salmon , sending home its data .
but now with light-based geolocation tags that are very small , we can actually see these journeys .
and when we do and it swims , we see this magnificent bathymetry that the shark knows is there on its path as it goes from california to hawaii .
let me just ask you , to start with , this simple question : who invented the mountain bike ?
that 's the idea of creativity .
we like to think that invention is a sort of moment of creation : there is a moment of birth when someone comes up with an idea .
they take their leisure very seriously : they acquire skills ; they invest time ; they use technology that 's getting cheaper -- it 's not just the internet : cameras , design technology , leisure technology , surfboards , so on and so forth .
well , the first thing you can say , i think with certainty , is what yochai has said already -- is there is a great big struggle between those two organizational forms .
shock , horror : now , the readers want to be writers and publishers .
let me just give you one final example of what that means .
or you can get on a plane , fly to shanghai , queue up outside shanda 's offices -- cost probably 600 , 700 dollars -- and reclaim your character , get your history back .
what i call the human portion -- humans and their livestock and pets -- versus the natural portion -- all the other wild animals and just -- these are vertebrates and all the birds , etc . , in the land and air , not in the water . how does it balance ?
we can 't go into that today because there isn 't time -- it 's a broad subject . one thing for sure , in the future there is an essential feature -- necessary , but not sufficient -- which is doing more with less . we 've got to be doing things with more efficiency using less energy , less material .
the message from all these vehicles is that ideas and technology can be harnessed to produce remarkable gains in doing more with less -- gains that can help us attain a desirable balance between technology and nature . the stakes are high as we speed toward a challenging future .
pm : but now we 're trying to get the video . there we go .
pm : if you can pass it down when you 're done . yeah , i think -- i lost a little orientation ; i looked up into this light .
things are going on this decade , next decade ; it 's a very short time that we have to decide what we are going to do .
you hear about it all the time .
aging brings some rather remarkable improvements -- increased knowledge , expertise -- and emotional aspects of life improve .
how sad are you right now ?
maybe our neural centers in our brain are degraded such that we 're unable to process negative emotions anymore .
by 2015 , there will be more people in the united states over the age of 60 than under 15 .
since then , we 've doubled the number of roads in america , and we now spend one fifth of our income on transportation .
but actually , they 're spending most of it in their homes , and home investment is about as local an investment as you can get .
in san diego , they used walk score -- walk score rates every address in america and soon the world in terms of how walkable it is -- they used walk score to designate more walkable neighborhoods and less walkable neighborhoods .
new york city .
there are only so many people in this country at any given time , and we can choose to live where perhaps we would have a lighter impact .
but what if lifestyle was really about quality of life and about perhaps something that we would all enjoy more , something that would be better than what we have right now ?
the talk will be broadly about energy , but oil 's a good place to start .
it 's been declining and i believe it will continue to decline .
and it 's just limestone , nothing really special about it .
now , what does this have to do with energy ?
we need four shoulder-high plants per person , and in terms of plant care , we need to wipe the leaves every day in delhi , and perhaps once a week in cleaner-air cities .
and there is a growing preference for living and working in air-conditioned places .
but what 's interesting is , i 've never had trouble traveling in any other western countries with my american passport , even though it says , " born in iran . " no problems .
like i think you 're missing the point here .
but what was interesting was , the pakistani muslim guy -- see he gives a bad name to muslims and middle easterners and pakistanis from all over the world .
they 're obsessed with having the biggest , tallest , longest , as we all know .
not in the middle east .
i 'll leave you guys with this : i try , with my stand-up , to break stereotypes , present middle easterners in a positive light -- muslims in a positive light -- and i hope that in the coming years , more film and television programs come out of hollywood presenting us in a positive light .
academic research on instant messaging also shows 100 people on buddy lists , but fundamentally people chat with two , three , four -- anyway , less than five .
they had set up a big screen in their living room , and every morning they had breakfast with their grandmother .
and it had nothing to do with technical capability .
people have taken this amazing possibility of actually being in contact all through the day or in all types of situations .
and believe me , i lived the same sad life until about three years ago .
start as usual , go the other way around the loop .
like , maybe i should have just gotten off with a warning instead of an actual ticket , because i 'm on the force .
now , these are golden words coming from someone who is speaking about their own experience , but when someone is telling you how you are going to feel , it 's instant crap .
maybe we make one small decision about our lives that can bring about big change .
hear how static that word sounds ?
and they left .
we have to let that old story go so that a new story , a truer story , can be told .
i will start with my wife , chaz .
human speech is an ingenious manipulation of our breath within the sound chamber of our mouth and respiratory system .
how did i feel not being able to speak ?
and here 's the voice we call roger jr .
the good people in scotland are still improving my voice , and i 'm optimistic about it .
this was a computer-assisted instruction system , which in those days ran on a computer named illiac .
it makes me incredibly fortunate to live at this moment in history .
when you see me today , i look like the phantom of the opera .
so i have not come here to complain .
all right .
if you look 50 years into the future , the way we probably will be making energy is probably one of these three , with some wind , with some other things , but these are going to be the base load energy drivers .
but small atoms want to join together , small nuclei want to join together to make bigger ones to go towards iron .
it 's pretty hot .
and lithium is in sea water . that 's the yellow line .
because we want 30 million years worth of fusion power for the earth .
let 's begin with a story .
matters of principle aside , practically speaking , these laws drive hiv underground .
unfortunately , these good laws are counter-balanced by a mass of really bad law -- law which is grounded in moral judgement and in fear and in misinformation , laws which specifically punish people living with hiv or those at greatest risk .
the nurse announced that every pregnant woman must also be tested for hiv that day .
only about half of the people who need treatment are currently receiving it .
the u.s. and malaysia came to harm reduction a little later , and they have higher rates of hiv in these populations .
and so we need to ensure that these people who are living with hiv or at greatest risk of hiv have access to legal services and they have equal access to the courts .
these clouds can grow so big , up to 50 miles wide and reach up to 65,000 feet into the atmosphere .
and i say , " well , that 's interesting . that 's not what i do . "
i 've got to produce the result now .
what is it that shapes us ? and we live in a therapy culture .
the defining factor is never resources ; it 's resourcefulness .
an emotion , then , creates what we 're going to do or the action .
so if you had a time you did something , and after you did it you thought to yourself , i can 't believe i said that , i can 't believe i did that , that was so stupid -- who 's been there ?
now , these are not goals or desires , these are universal .
who knows what 's going to happen next ? kind of exciting .
and it 's exciting . when you see nicholas up here talking about his $ 100 computer , the most passionate exciting thing is : here 's a genius , but he 's got a calling now .
and as you move in a direction , you have a destination or destiny .
and she played the recording for us in the room .
i spend a lot of time in urban areas looking for design , and studying design in the public sector .
and since that time in amsterdam , i spent an increasing amount of time in the cities , looking at design for common evidence of design that really isn 't under so much of a designer 's signature .
just a piece of barrier tape construction stuff in italy .
and cuba needs to be far more resourceful , because of the blockades and things , but a really wonderful playground .
and i came outside , and the valets for this car service had created , you know , quite a nice little collage of these car keys , and my closest equivalent were a group of prayer tags that i had seen in tokyo .
there are common elements of this that you 'll see throughout chicago , and then there are your big-d design statements : the pritzker pavilion done by frank gehry .
so the rate of reading the genetic code has changed .
so this is a satellite photograph based on temperatures -- red being warm , blue being cold -- and we found there 's a tremendous difference between the warm water samples and the cold water samples , in terms of abundant species .
haemophilus had 1,800 genes .
basically , any virus that 's been sequenced today -- that genome can be made .
after these genomes are synthesized , the first step is just transplanting them into a cell without a genome .
it was actually a very strange study , because the various religious leaders were using their scriptures as law books , and they couldn 't find anything in them prohibiting making life , so it must be ok . the only ultimate concerns were biological warfare aspects of this , but gave us the go ahead to start these experiments for the reasons we were doing them .
this will take about 30 seconds or so .
i 'm going to start with some simple kind of notions of how we organize things .
and it 's not any single system that makes the work .
architecture for me has been an investigation of a multiplicity of forces that could come from literally any place .
and as it moves , it takes pieces of the earth with it . it bends up .
it forces air through a venturi force if there 's no wind .
i have absolutely no interest in producing a building that just accommodates x , y and z function .
and a project that was realized in austria , the hooper bank , which again used this idea of connecting typology , the traditional buildings , and morphology , or the relationship of the development of land as an idea , into a complex , which is a piece of a city where we can see part of it is literally just this augmenting , this movement of the land that 's a very simple idea of just lifting it up and occupying it , and other parts are much more energetic and intense .
and we spent some time with conan , believe it or not , and then that led us to , kind of , the very differences of our worlds from a legal and an artistic , architectural .
frei otto was starting to use foam bubble diagrams and foam bubble models to generate his mannheim concert hall .
you know , i haven 't verified this , but it 's the norm that every chair would be a slightly different dimension , because you 'd want to space them all out for everybody 's sight lines .
so , these are the different perspectives of that interior , which has a very complex set of orientations all in a simple form .
it 's an incredibly expensive coffee and tea set ; we knew that at the beginning . so , i actually went to some people i knew down south in san diego , and we used an exploded titanium forming method that 's used in the aerospace industry .
we have a company called united architects .
creativity is how we cope with creation .
on my way out , i had to break a fight apart .
this is the ashanti joystick .
he put together two different media from different periods of time .
departing from the lines , i decided to tackle the idea of points , like which is more similar to the type of representation that we find in photographs themselves .
like , you know , you have the skin particles of every single museum visitor .
i wasn 't interested in the very large things , or in the small things .
thank you very much .
but before i do , i just want you to ponder this graph for a moment .
but i was in for the adventure .
phoenix islands is a major tuna location .
and he says , " cause that 's where all the money is . "
just get whatever anybody wants . "
it had occurred on land , in rainforests of south america and africa , where landowners had been paid not to cut the trees down .
of course the deep-sea areas and the open ocean areas were fine , but the coral , which everybody likes to look at , was in trouble .
and that insured that we could move this forward and it would have both the self-interest of kiribati as well as the self-interest of the world .
i 'm going to play you just a couple of quick excerpts from the project .
glenn lowry , the head of moma , put it best when he said , " we want visitors to actually cease being visitors .
and of course the event itself is so recent , somewhere between history and current events , it was a huge challenge to imagine how do you actually live up to a space like this , an event like this , to actually tell that story .
voice 7 : it was probably about 11 o 'clock at night .
" how could 9 / 11 have happened ? "
and ramos told wald , according to witnesses , " i 'm not going to leave you . "
you 'll eat countless gourmet meals .
but i wouldn 't change my experience .
so , as the president now reassures us , we are on track to achieve our goals .
today , there are 14 health clinics in that area alone .
but it is a place where the putting-in of the troops has increased the violence rather than decreased it .
or in 2010 , the u.k. foreign secretary , david miliband , who said that at last we would deliver the " decisive year . "
and there was not a single pashto speaker .
and this is what we 've lost in afghanistan and iraq .
but what really matters is two kinds of problems -- problems that occur on the mountain which you couldn 't anticipate , such as , for example , ice on a slope , but which you can get around , and problems which you couldn 't anticipate and which you can 't get around , like a sudden blizzard or an avalanche or a change in the weather .
what we should have done in libya is we should have stuck to the u.n. resolution .
you work by learning , and you learn by working .
it 's happened almost entirely without big money behind it .
i 'm going to talk about dinosaurs .
every museum wanted a little bigger or better one than anybody else had .
in 1975 , a light went on in somebody 's head .
they put them in foam , little containers .
so these are dinosaurs that are called pachycephalosaurs .
and one would think , that should give me a clue .
and we know why , right ?
and torosaurus , when we cut into it , has mature bone .
so we can just keep doing this .
fourth-graders love their dinosaurs , they memorize them .
what they found on monday was evidence of the ringing of the space-time of the early universe , what we call gravitational waves from the fundamental era , and here 's how they found it .
so it 's a really slow process , it 's really expensive , and the outcome of that process , namely electronic circuit boards , are limited in all sorts of kind of interesting ways .
a beard full of bees .
it 's just because people are uncomfortable with the idea , and that 's why i want you today to try to think about this , think about the benefits of bees in cities and why they really are a terrific thing .
so the yield for urban hives , in terms of honey production , is higher as well as the overwintering survival , compared to rural areas .
they don 't experience this .
and then one day i said , " why don 't we just do an oral vaccine ? "
now , this was a mystery in the new york times where the honey was very red , and the new york state forensics department came in and they actually did some science to match the red dye with that found in a maraschino cherry factory down the street .
and b was last heard of in the pope 's library about a hundred miles north of rome in viterbo in 1311 .
forgeries were painted over it , and it suffered very badly from mold .
the top half is elmer 's wood glue .
and the image on the right is an ultraviolet image .
and this x-ray is specific in its wavelength to the atom that it hits .
but no one knew what archimedes was doing with these 14 bits .
he lived for another 10 years , then the macedonian faction caught up with him .
it 's going to be built by users , by people who get this data together , by people who want to aggregate all sorts of maps from wherever they come from , all sorts of medieval romances from wherever they come from , people who just want to curate their own glorious selection of beautiful things .
i am multidisciplinary .
and the seeker project is actually challenging communities all over the world to come up with starship prototypes that re-envision human habitation and survival .
now , when we 're thinking about starships , we 're not just approaching it as a technological challenge .
but there were also plenty of places in the world where societies have been developing for thousands of years without any sign of a major collapse , such as japan , java , tonga and tikopea . so evidently , societies in some areas are more fragile than in other areas .
yes , acute in montana . toxic problems from mine waste have caused damage of billions of dollars .
and i would expect that , if our human civilization carries on , then maybe in the next century people will be asking , why on earth did these people today in the year 2003 not see the obvious things that they were doing and take corrective action ?
instead , all the major threats facing us today are problems entirely of our own making . and since we made the problems , we can also solve the problems . that then means that it 's entirely in our power to deal with these problems .
this part 's not going to be on the test . "
or this fangtooth . the particles in the water make it look like it 's floating in outer space .
of course , sea cucumbers shoot them out their rears , which , in my opinion , makes them much more interesting a superhero .
he 's kind of just out there making a living .
then he meets the yeti crab , the famous vampire squid -- elusive , hard to find -- and the dumbo octopus , which looks so much like a cartoon in real life that really didn 't have to change a thing when i drew it .
now , finning is the act of taking a shark , cutting the valuable fins off and throwing the live animal back in the water .
and voila , next-day air , they show up , and they surgically reattach them .
and you realize where you are ; you 're in the louvre .
between them , the two already pervade , as most of you here seated realize , every dimension of human life .
some may have considered me foolhardy , but it 's been my habit to brush aside the fear of mathematics when talking to candidate scientists .
consider the following principle , which i will modestly call wilson 's principle number one : it is far easier for scientists including medical researchers , to require needed collaboration in mathematics and statistics than it is for mathematicians and statisticians to find scientists able to make use of their equations .
the world needs this kind of expertise , and it rewards the kind of people willing to acquire it .
and i thank you for having me here tonight .
fortunately , more and more institutions are implementing the more holistic models that i and a few of my colleagues have introduced to the field of soundscape ecology .
well , i 've returned to lincoln meadow 15 times in the last 25 years , and i can tell you that the biophony , the density and diversity of that biophony , has not yet returned to anything like it was before the operation .
i want to end with a story told by a beaver .
i 'd like to begin with my very first object , which i call " the uncle phone . "
and if it 's even more silent , they stretch their necks out .
so we worked with a company that specializes in camera surveillance , and we asked them to develop a piece of software with us , using a camera that could look at people in the room , track them and replace one person with the background , rendering them invisible .
and there 's no wires .
but we use it because we 're interested in the way that it can help us to express the emotions and behavioral patterns in these creatures that we create .
at the same time , our debt level 's gone up to 120 and we 're all feeling slightly miserable as a result .
and this very encouraging story , i think , is partly demographic-led .
they will get the textiles jobs that will take people out of rural poverty and put them on the road to industrialization and wealth .
so democracy is encouraging governments to invest in education .
and if you go back to the year 2000 , what you 'll find is the economist had a very famous cover , " the hopeless continent , " and what they 'd done is they 'd looked at growth in africa over the previous 10 years -- two percent -- and they said , what 's going to happen in the next 10 years ?
twenty years of not much growth and a trend line which is actually telling you that sub-saharan african growth is slightly better than india .
go on holiday and see for yourself the change that 's happening .
and i 'm going to tell you what the cost of wikipedia is , but first i 'll show you how big it is .
you could never afford to do this in a company .
time magazine recently reported that " extreme action sometimes has to be taken , and wales locked the entries on kerry and bush for most of 2004 . "
so we have very diverse contributors in terms of political , religious , cultural backgrounds .
all these people know each other . they communicate ; we have offline meetings .
so we needed a social method for figuring out the answer to this .
people really want to know about , ok , administrators , things like that .
that 's neo-nazi math for you .
the last time i got an e-mail from a journalist saying , " why do academics hate wikipedia ? "
now , for about 200 years , people have been saying exactly what i 'm telling you -- the age of technological unemployment is at hand — starting with the luddites smashing looms in britain just about two centuries ago , and they have been wrong .
we are seeing an amazing flourishing taking place .
we all know a lot of the statistics , but just to repeat one of them , median income in america has actually gone down over the past 15 years , and we 're in danger of getting trapped in some vicious cycle where inequality and polarization continue to go up over time .
bill 's hasn 't .
i witnessed this firsthand .
we could send congress on an autonomous car road trip .
and they were moving and grinding and moving their arms up and down each other .
that , for centuries , we 've inherited a view of human nature based on the notion that we 're divided selves , that reason is separated from the emotions and that society progresses to the extent that reason can suppress the passions .
and so the kids are raised in a certain way , jumping through achievement hoops of the things we can measure -- sat prep , oboe , soccer practice .
and this leads to oddities .
and the third insight is that we 're not primarily self-contained individuals .
the baby wagged her tongue back .
they are open-minded in the face of ambiguity .
and this is not an ability ; it 's a drive and a motivation .
in his inaugural address , barack obama appealed to each of us to give our best as we try to extricate ourselves from this current financial crisis .
and then there was luke , who washed the floor in a comatose young man 's room twice because the man 's father , who had been keeping a vigil for six months , didn 't see luke do it the first time , and his father was angry .
and they don 't mean it takes lots of experience to learn how to mop floors and empty trash cans .
and the child was sent to a foster home for three days .
and would you pay them a bonus for being empathic ?
we need more rules for the bankers , god knows .
two reasons . it 's my responsibility and i 'm getting paid .
one : celebrate moral exemplars .
why ? because there happy to be doing something that 's the right thing to do .
and there are a few things that we have to remember as teachers .
i think there is reason for hope .
now , what has happened ?
but they are falling only slowly , because in botswana , with good economy and governance , they can manage to treat people .
i found out that salt lake city and san francisco were different .
see the difference within one african country -- it goes from very low level to very high level , and most of the provinces in kenya is quite modest .
it could be that there is other things which makes transmission occur in a higher frequency .
now , i 'm an ethnobotanist .
where 's the cure for insomnia ?
here 's an ayahuasca shaman in the northwest amazon , in the middle of a yage ceremony .
the top half of the picture , you see where the indians live .
by our standards , some would dismiss these people as primitive .
the demand for natural rubber , which came from the amazon , set off the botanical equivalent of a gold rush .
in fact , nobody has been atop the bell mountain since schultes in ' 43 .
this is an art exhibit in havana , cuba .
this is a picture of actual contact .
and i would like to make a case to you that over the years since we first developed atomic weaponry , until this very moment , we 've actually lived in a dangerous nuclear world that 's characterized by two phases , which i 'm going to go through with you right now .
and basically , we lived for all those years , and some might argue that we still do , in a situation of being on the brink , literally , of an apocalyptic , planetary calamity .
and actually -- so there are multiple uses of the bomb shelters .
so organizations like physicians for social responsibility , around 1979 , started saying this a lot publicly .
from 1993 through 2006 , the international atomic energy agency documented 175 cases of nuclear theft , 18 of which involved highly enriched uranium or plutonium , the key ingredients to make a nuclear weapon .
if you have an undergraduate degree in physics , i would suggest -- although i don 't , so maybe it 's not even true -- but something close to that would allow you , with the information that 's currently available , to actually build a nuclear weapon .
and they look like this . they 're basically very simple arrangements .
we 're coming down , and we bring that truck that you just saw somewhere in here , in the financial district .
so you 're feeling the wind -- and there 's tremendous wind now that you 're going to be feeling -- and you want to go perpendicular to the wind [ not upwind or downwind ] .
the key to surviving a nuclear blast is getting out , and not going into harm 's way .
and you want something to work on once you 've fixed global warming , i urge you to think about the fact that we have to do something about this unacceptable , inhumane reality of nuclear weapons in our world .
so it looks something like this .
three iq points per 10 years , going up .
you can say a miracle occurs .
and this is what he ended up concluding that he saw .
and , of course , happy faces .
and we went down , investigated .
now , i 'll prime your auditory part of your brain to tell you what you 're supposed to hear , and then hear it again .
and said , " i 'm so embarrassed .
here i 'm one person talking to you .
all entertainment contains a little frisson of danger , something that might happen wrong , and yet we like it when there 's protection .
here 's one of his cartoons .
what is it , the cartoon ? is it really about lemmings ?
well , i 'm going to kill a few , but there won 't be any genocide .
office worker : falafel ? bm : let me look at it .
there 's a concept about humor about it being a benign violation .
" the rejection collection " is absolutely in this field .
it 's not always appropriate every time .
and so the new yorker is also trying to , in some way , make cartoons say something besides funny and something about us . here 's another one .
but the way incongruity works is , observational humor is humor within the realm of reality .
engineering can be inspired by biology by using its principles and analogies when they 're advantageous , but then integrating that with the best human engineering , ultimately to make something actually better than nature .
lynn made it to the top in a perfect pairing of hollywood and science .
they said , " well , it kind of looks like a tail . "
robert full : he talked about the tail being a whip for communication .
but there it is slowed down .
so the wind is coming from the bottom . this is slowed down 10 times .
it 's unbelievable .
and from what i heard from our new president , i 'm very optimistic . thank you .
if there is one thing bp 's watery improv act made clear , it is that , as a culture , we have become far too willing to gamble with things that are precious and irreplaceable , and to do so without a back-up plan , without an exit strategy .
the fact is that we simply don 't know when the warming that we create will be utterly overwhelmed by feedback loops .
here 's what i 'm talking about .
now the problem is that the story was always a lie .
i 'm always surprised by how little people outside of canada know about the alberta tar sands , which this year are projected to become the number one source of imported oil to the united states .
just when we know we need to be learning to live on the surface of our planet , off the power of sun , wind and waves , we are frantically digging to get at the dirtiest , highest-emitting stuff imaginable .
we need stories that have different kinds of heroes willing to take different kinds of risks -- risks that confront recklessness head on , that put the precautionary principle into practice , even if that means through direct action -- like hundreds of young people willing to get arrested , blocking dirty power plants or fighting mountaintop-removal coal mining .
now , what is game theory about ?
that person surrounds himself or herself with advisers .
to 1,200 ? no .
and so we have to figure out how they balance those two things .
i 've taken inputs on positions and so forth , run it through a computer model that had simulated the dynamics of interaction , and these are the simulated dynamics , the predictions about the path of policy .
that power disappears completely ; nobody supports that by 2011 .
i love that you put it out there .
i 'm going to tell you about how i learned something about life .
it grows up into the adult stage like that and then goes through a benjamin button phase , and actually goes backwards and backwards until it 's like a little embryo again , and then actually grows back up , and back down and back up -- sort of yo-yo -- and it never dies .
and it says something complicated with lots and lots of concepts .
and he went home and says , " i know how to fix this . "
by the way , this is highly accelerated , so it 's like a thousand generations a second .
and if i look at french texts , it looks a little bit different , or italian or german .
it doesn 't matter what kind of sediment you 're using to grind up , whether it 's bacteria or any other plants or animals .
and i 'm starting this at a mutation rate that is so high that , even if you would drop a replicating program that would otherwise happily grow up to fill the entire world , if you drop it in , it gets mutated to death immediately .
so the first thing that we learn is that it is possible to define life in terms of processes alone , without referring at all to the type of things that we hold dear , as far as the type of life on earth is .
the rules of engagement : how to talk , when to talk , and how to deal with them .
now i 'm not naive .
everybody seems to agree with that .
and who knows what it will be called in the end .
now talking can be accompanied with aid or not with aid .
we have to connect with these profound changes .
it is going to demand an inclusive process of diplomacy very different from the one we are practicing today as we are heading to new rounds of difficult climate negotiations , but when we move toward something which has to be much more along a broad mobilization .
the call came from a veterinarian at the los angeles zoo .
you know , we hear about these city kids who think that wool grows on trees or that cheese comes from a plant .
some pluck out patches of hair , others actually cut themselves .
a physician .
not only would it have been burned in engines and added to global warming , but there 's a place called " cancer alley , " and the reason it 's called " cancer alley " is because the petrochemical industry takes that oil and turns it into plastic and , in the process , kills people .
i 'm going to put it in the blue bin . "
it 's just awful , those poor people .
and as we all begin to come back to that basic understanding , new opportunities for action begin to emerge .
well that idea of biomimicry , respecting the wisdom of all species , combined with the idea of democracy and social justice , respecting the wisdom and the worth of all people , would give us a different society .
how can this movement be so passionate about saying we don 't have throwaway stuff , no throwaway dead materials , and yet accept throwaway lives and throwaway communities like " cancer alley ? "
and in the course of that , i studied , i met with medical doctors , scientists , and i 'm here to tell you that the way to a more productive , more inspired , more joyful life is getting enough sleep .
thank you so much .
humanity is building a machine , and this enables us to collaborate in new ways .
so this technology push , a demographic kick from a new generation and a demand pull from a new economic global environment is causing the world to open up .
he takes his geological data , he publishes it and he holds a contest on the internet called the goldcorp challenge .
and everywhere , our institutions are becoming naked .
now , conventional wisdom says , " well , hey , our intellectual property belongs to us , and if someone tries to infringe it , we 're going to get out our lawyers and we 're going to sue them . "
and then it ended up having a whole bunch of other words too .
i mean , we 're not putting this one back .
to me , this is not an information age , it 's an age of networked intelligence .
and imagine , just consider this idea , if you would : what if we could connect ourselves in this world through a vast network of air and glass ?
the number of petals on a flower is typically a fibonacci number , or the number of spirals on a sunflower or a pineapple tends to be a fibonacci number as well .
those are not fibonacci numbers , but if you look at them closely , you 'll see the fibonacci numbers buried inside of them .
now check this out .
we also associate it with being stress-free and on holiday .
so , ask yourself : is this person ever going to drive at a steady 28 miles per hour ? i don 't think so .
music is very powerful . and unfortunately it 's veneering commercial spaces , often inappropriately .
it can be a bit like a bowl of spaghetti : sometimes you just have to eat it and see what happens .
but the under-underdog hangs tough , and 22 miles into a 26-mile race , there is derartu tulu up there with the lead pack .
and the answer to it , i think , can be found down in the copper canyons of mexico , where there 's a tribe , a reclusive tribe , called the tarahumara indians .
to have a brain of that size , you need to have a source of condensed caloric energy .
now i 've been to a lot of marathons , and i 've yet to see any ...
you 've got to be really careful any time someone looks back in prehistory and tries to give you some sort of global answer , because , it being prehistory , you can say whatever the hell you want and get away with it .
those expert trackers have got to be part of the pack .
and what happened was we started creating these fancy cushioned things , which can make running " better , " called running shoes .
we need to get back to that sense of playfulness and joyfulness and , i would say , nakedness , that has made the tarahumara one of the healthiest and serene cultures in our time .
i 'll give you an example -- if you take a horseshoe crab off the beach , and you fly it all the way across the continent , and you drop it into a sloped cage , it will scramble up the floor of the cage as the tide is rising on its home shores , and it 'll skitter down again right as the water is receding thousands of miles away .
they go to bed around 8 : 00 p.m.
in the age of globalization , we moved on .
by the age of 24 , i found myself convicted in prison in egypt , being blacklisted from three countries in the world for attempting to overthrow their governments , being subjected to torture in egyptian jails and sentenced to five years as a prisoner of conscience .
and on the flip side , we have transnational islamist extremists doing the same thing across their own societies .
if i asked you to think of the ideas of al-qaeda , that 's something that comes to your mind immediately .
the second , i believe , is political correctness .
his deputy , ayman al-zawahiri , was a pediatrician -- not an ill-educated man .
now to conclude , how does that happen ?
now when i look back , the transplant was actually the easiest part .
but my joyful period was marred by solemn and morbid thoughts -- thoughts of walking through the prison 's high-security death row , as this was the only route to take me to the makeshift operating room .
today we realize that there are many different types of stem cells .
what happened to me might have been catastrophic , if not for the fact that i was in reach of good surgical access .
powerful new technologies always present enigmas .
so he designed and went and started a village science program .
it 's like its own little coupling .
they always make a triangular roof .
i see hope . i see happiness in their faces .
if i do it with both hands , you can see this fun mr. flying man .
six major research papers on this .
it 's the interaction of both these magnets which makes this motor spin .
i 'm going to keep this outside , to blow out . i 'm going to suck in air .
these are two magnets .
and if you have one of these birds -- children in japan have been making this bird for many , many years .
suddenly there was a storm and huge waves .
it 's going to sashay away to live to fly another day .
now flies excel in the sorts of sensors that they carry to this problem .
but remember that this kind of brain , which is much , much smaller — instead of 100 billion neurons , it has 100,000 neurons — but this is the most common form of brain on the planet and has been for 400 million years .
so for example , i 'm going to show you a sequence , and i have to say , some of my funding comes from the military , so i 'm showing this classified sequence and you cannot discuss it outside of this room . okay ?
and i think , from an engineering perspective , you think of multiplexing .
you can tether a fly to a little stick .
now , another idea , another way of multiplexing is multiplexing in space , having different parts of a neuron do different things at the same time .
i met this woman , mama rose , who has rented that little tin shack for 32 years , where she lives with her seven children .
she had a girlfriend who had heard about this organization , jamii bora , that would lend money to people no matter how poor you were , as long as you provided a commensurate amount in savings .
and she said , " what would i miss ?
we are everyone . we are no one .
but there is also a very serious aspect to anonymous -- they are ideologically driven .
they 're completely anonymous , as it were .
this is ready for use , out-of-the-box stuff , which you can deploy even if you 're not a terribly sophisticated hacker .
he sort of understood the technology , and he realized that security was very important if you were going to be a carder , but he didn 't spend his days and nights bent over a computer , eating pizza , drinking coke and that sort of thing .
his slide into criminality was incremental .
remember that , when they developed those hacking skills , their moral compass had not yet developed .
okay , well that makes sense . thanks a lot misha .
and to make it a bit simpler for myself , i decided to map out a scientific criteria . and here it is .
i can 't really do cancer research on my kitchen countertop .
this makes it 168 times faster , over 26,000 times less expensive , and over 400 times more sensitive than our current standard for pancreatic cancer detection .
they have different interests . they have divergent values .
now , my second example is for a slightly younger crowd .
and to my mind , those are pretty wise words , no matter what your creed . thank you .
but there are two things at heart that i think drive a conservative philosophy that are really relevant to this whole debate .
and hopefully this slide is going to morph beautifully . there we are .
anyone thinking , " i could do that service better , i could deliver it cheaper , " it 's all available there .
why ? it cuts fuel poverty , it cuts their bills , and it cuts carbon emissions at the same time .
it measures neither our wit nor our courage , neither our wisdom nor our learning , neither our compassion nor our devotion to our country .
you overcompensate .
in south africa , the relationship most devoid of trust is that between a white policeman and the black community .
and yet , ladies and gentlemen , every single one of us on this planet probably engages with music on a daily basis .
if you 'll pardon the expression .
well done , ladies and gentlemen .
nicholas : : my name 's nicholas mccarthy .
and you 'll see the orchestra in a kind of sullen revolt .
you can think of a death penalty case as a story that has four chapters .
so we have this paradox , which is that the number of annual executions has remained high but the number of new death sentences has gone down .
and eight out of 10 times , the details of that biography will be more or less accurate .
what we 're talking about today is also rocket science .
even if we do all of those things , some kids are going to fall through the cracks and they 're going to end up in that last chapter before the murder story begins , they 're going to end up in the juvenile justice system .
and he was talking first about his dad , who he hardly knew , who had died , and then about his mom , who he did know , who is still alive .
i was raised with a very heavy sense of unfinished legacy .
now i tell you this -- i tell you this at the risk of embarrassing myself , because i think part of the work of feminism is to admit that aesthetics , that beauty , that fun do matter .
so we 're able to pull in the next generation in a totally new way .
i admitted that i 'd actually had a fantasy -- kind of a dark fantasy -- of writing a letter about everything that was wrong with the world and then lighting myself on fire on the white house steps .
cornel west says , " of course it 's a failure .
in 2009 , there were 500 bomb blasts across pakistan .
soc : i , in my research , have seen that the taliban have perfected the way in which they recruit and train children , and i think it 's a five-step process .
now these children are primed to become suicide bombers .
singer : on the day of judgment my god will call me my body will be put back together and god will ask me why i did this soc : i leave you all with this thought : if you grew up in these circumstances , faced with these choices , would you choose to live in this world or in the glorious afterlife ?
and they did . and when they did , it was like a nuclear bomb went off in little greenville .
so it got me thinking , what is it ?
but price to entry into that competition would be , you could just , say , use the president 's goal .
they can 't agree to anything . "
and , you know , built the society that we now live in .
a third of the people on this planet are kids .
give you a little peek into our editorial notebook .
this is the beddington zero energy development in london , which is one of the greenest buildings in the world . it 's a fabulous place .
there 's a lot of this stuff happening ; it 's really pretty remarkable .
all throughout the developing world , people are going directly to cell phones , skipping the whole landline stage .
it 's doing something new . there 's new things happening .
i would keep your eye on this fellow .
these are led lights that help the roughly billion people out there , for whom nightfall means darkness , to have a new means of operating .
new models for pedagogy for the displaced .
so does that .
add some water .
you know ?
so i know it may sound like tough love , but look , if at some point you got lied to , it 's because you agreed to get lied to .
he said , " look , i 've got one rule . "
if you 're an average married couple , you 're going to lie to your spouse in one out of every 10 interactions .
we 're hardwired to become leaders of the pack .
and then we 're going to look at the hot spots and see if we can find them ourselves .
we all chatter with our fingertips .
now i know it seems really obvious , but when you 're having a conversation with someone you suspect of deception , attitude is by far the most overlooked but telling of indicators .
and we 're going to see that in several videos moving forward , but we 're going to start -- for those of you who don 't know him , this is presidential candidate john edwards who shocked america by fathering a child out of wedlock .
it 's marked by one lip corner pulled up and in .
but i 'm going to show you two videos , two mothers -- one is lying , one is telling the truth .
but you 've got to ask yourself in the meantime : who do you want on your side of the meeting , someone who 's trained in getting to the truth or some guy who 's going to drag a 400-pound electroencephalogram through the door ?
you 're going to fail , too — — because — goodness , you 're all cheery about failing .
and then , of course , another excuse : " well , i would do this , i would do this , but , but , well , after all , i 'm not weird .
and what , what are you trying to tell me ? that you — " " well , i have an interest . "
yes he did .
hmm ? look at the worldview you 've given yourself .
you know what you 're going to say ?
great friend , great spouse , great parent , great career .
we piled enormous amounts of pollution into the air and into the water .
it 's the styrofoam and chocolate game .
juveniles : a huge load .
it turns out that a lot of dolphins are being sold as meat in the whale meat market around the world .
and if we jam nutrients , sewage , fertilizer in the base of that food pyramid , it can back up all through it .
these same infections create harmful algal blooms .
but there 's a greater sense here that what the individual communities need is working ecosystems .
once i realized that i could take some liberties with the subject , i did the following series of drawings .
now , " swiss " works , but you know it 's going to cost a lot of money .
and so , i do something i 'm truthfully ashamed of , which is that i took two drawings i had made for another purpose and i put them together .
i guess one could reduce the idea further by suggesting that the new emerges behind and through the old , like this . "
now , this is a little illusion .
the phrase ' art is whatever ' expresses the current inclusiveness that surrounds art-making -- a sort of ' it ain 't what you do , it 's the way that you do it ' notion .
and at times , when we were like this , so much " shhh , " so much " shhh " going on in the house that i imagined us to be like the german crew of a u-boat creeping along the edge of the ocean whilst up above , on the surface , hms bageye patrolled ready to drop death charges at the first sound of any disturbance .
so bageye is bald and has baggy eyes .
somehow they find their way to you .
they were timid , and somewhere along the line , the natural order was reversed .
when the book came out , it had fair reviews in the national papers , but the paper of choice in luton is not the guardian , it 's the luton news , and the luton news ran the headline about the book , " the book that may heal a 32-year-old rift . "
i did no longer want him to die or to murder him , and i felt free , much freer than i 'd ever felt before .
morgan o 'neill : so , on june 1st we weren 't disaster experts , but on june 3rd we started faking it .
and as we watched , they became frustrated and left to go find somebody to help on their own .
co : my car is in my living room .
co : i decided to stay in the country , give up the master 's in moscow and to work full-time to make this happen .
mo : data .
so that 's what we 're working on .
now , remarks of this sort on the negative and the positive side are very old .
here 's another argument against this view .
it consists of the things that other people had instead of christianity .
this is a soul disc .
now , this would be a mere historical curiosity , except that in large parts of the world , this is still the truth .
so before i do that , just one warning , which is that this presentation has been rated ' r ' by the motion picture association of america .
and so it wasn 't really a career .
so this is where we enter the picture .
this is a very dangerous job , being in a gang -- you don 't like to be surprised .
but ultimately , the story has a happy ending for sudhir , who became one of the most respected sociologists in the country .
but the thing that really makes the gang seem like mcdonald 's is its franchisees .
it was below the minimum wage , ok ? and this is well documented .
that is about as high as you can get .
and then all of my friends said : " maybe i should go do that , too . "
let me do one last thing i hadn 't thought i 'd have time to do , which is to talk about what we learned , more generally , about economics from the study of the gang .
they 're talking about the decision of why they don 't go shoot -- one thing that turns out to be a great business tactic in the gang , if you go and just shoot in the air -- just shoot guns in the other gang 's territory -- all the people are afraid to go buy their drugs there .
i think those are interesting ideas , if you could .
with your eyes closed , what am i wearing ?
so if i ask you to access a memory , like , what is that ?
hopefully so . have a seat . there you go . you 're doing well .
i 'm not ready for that kind of commitment .
joe , we 're going to keep doing this till you catch it .
if we watch this kind of close , it looks like it goes away .
hopefully it matches his taste .
you tie me to the mast , and i 'm going to beg and plead .
a commitment device is a decision that you make with a cool head to bind yourself so that you don 't do something regrettable when you have a hot head .
it 's off in the future . it 's weak .
sometimes a good person would find it , sometimes a bad person would find it .
the present self does not want to save at all .
being down at the bottom means that you 're struggling to make ends meet .
the last thing i 'll show you , the last behavioral time machine , is something that i created with hal hershfield , who was introduced to me by my coauthor on a previous project , bill sharpe .
and slowly , slowly we 're bringing it up to a moderate savings rate .
we are now going through an amazing and unprecedented moment where the power dynamics between men and women are shifting very rapidly , and in many of the places where it counts the most , women are , in fact , taking control of everything .
now all you men out there , this is not the moment where you tune out or throw some tomatoes , because the point is that this is happening to all of us .
but in fact , they found something very surprising .
but of course , it 's not about that .
now one day it might be that mothers will hire an out-of-work , middle-aged , former steelworker guy to watch their children at home , and that would be good for the men , but that hasn 't quite happened yet .
they are more controlled .
" that 's your salary .
so you can see that these economic changes really do have a strong effect on our culture .
what crazy person would pop their head through a glass ceiling ?
and there should be a pencil .
and if you 're starting a design firm , let 's say , then you probably also want to create a place where people have the same kind of security .
and i forgot to bring one up with me .
it 's not that hard . most of your kids figure out how to do this in the first 10 seconds , when they pick it up .
or is it just some weird shadows on the tree ?
so we 're back to work . you guys are going to get back to work again .
we stop ourselves from doing things .
in fact , maybe this experiment was the reason that silicon valley got off to its great start with innovation .
now , while the eameses were exploring those possibilities , they were also exploring physical objects .
at ideo there 's a kind of a back-to-preschool feel sometimes about the environment .
they can be a little skeptical ; i 'll come back to that .
so anyhow , he went there with his video camera , and it 's kind of interesting to see what he brought back .
when kids play tea party , or they play cops and robbers , they 're following a script that they 've agreed to .
you 're either playful or you 're serious , and you can 't be both .
he could see what was happening to his forest , to his environment , because he was taken under his grandfather 's wing when he was only two years old to begin to learn about the forest and the way of life of his people .
if you were to meet benki and ask him , " why are you doing this ?
you know more than benki knew when he left his forest and went 3,000 miles .
and so in 1993 , a long time ago , she decided to start a new organization called samraksha focused on one of the hardest areas , one of the hardest issues in india -- anywhere in the world at the time -- hiv / aids .
instead of handing out information in pamphlets , as is so often the case , they bring theater troupes , songs , music , dance .
for example , he 's got over one million pieces documenting the sino-japanese war , a war that 's not talked about in china very much and whose heroes are not honored .
and they know that they 're part of a whole , that they depend on other people .
and when i came home , i found the scope of my existence gradually diminishing until loading the dishwasher seemed like an interesting challenge .
a trophic cascade is an ecological process which starts at the top of the food chain and tumbles all the way down to the bottom , and the classic example is what happened in the yellowstone national park in the united states when wolves were reintroduced in 1995 .
but here 's where it gets really interesting .
you begin to see that possibly , the evidence supporting james lovelock 's gaia hypothesis , which conceives of the world as a coherent , self-regulating organism , is beginning , at the ecosystem level , to accumulate .
when trafalgar square in london was excavated , the river gravels there were found to be stuffed with the bones of hippopotamus , rhinos , elephants , hyenas , lions .
and perhaps this is the most important thing that rewilding offers us , the most important thing that 's missing from our lives : hope .
and they laughed at him . for 20 years , they called this guy " the mosquito man . " but he ran an experiment in people , right ? he had this hypothesis , and he tested it in people .
his choices ran through to me . he was a smoker , like most people were . this is my son .
my sister is a cancer survivor .
this is the interpretation of it . as you can see , i carry a 32 percent risk of prostate cancer , 22 percent risk of psoriasis and a 14 percent risk of alzheimer 's disease .
i 'm from tennessee . it 's not the most science-positive state in the united states of america .
it 's very much the design principles of a commons that we 're trying to bring to health data .
i feel it 's sort of like the vimalakirti sutra , an ancient work from ancient india in which the buddha appears at the beginning and a whole bunch of people come to see him from the biggest city in the area , vaishali , and they bring some sort of jeweled parasols to make an offering to him .
and of course , we all will be deeply disappointed when we do .
my bones are aching . i go from birth to death . i 'm never satisfied .
he once told me -- he looked kind of sad ; he worries very much about the haves and have-nots .
so , compassion means to feel the feelings of others , and the human being actually is compassion .
when philanthropy was reinvented a century ago , when the foundation form was actually invented , they didn 't think of themselves on the wrong side of these either .
now we have wikipedia .
it 's not just that warren buffet was so amazingly generous in that historic act last summer .
now , what 's really interesting here is that we 're not thinking our way into a new way of acting ; we 're acting our way into a new way of thinking .
we can create a future where hope and history rhyme .
and you can be secure even if you don 't feel it .
we make them every day -- last night in my hotel room , when i decided to double-lock the door , or you in your car when you drove here , when we go eat lunch and decide the food 's not poison and we 'll eat it .
a lot of good experiments in this .
when something is so common , it 's no longer news -- car crashes , domestic violence -- those are the risks you worry about .
and there are two ways to do this .
i want to add a third element . i want to add model .
he had some very complex models of how to survive .
we change light bulbs without even thinking about it .
i 'm going to give one more complication .
and there 's another cognitive bias i 'll call confirmation bias , where we tend to accept data that confirms our beliefs and reject data that contradicts our beliefs .
we rely on government agencies to tell us what pharmaceuticals are safe .
we don 't know .
i wonder how rampant baby snatching is out of hospitals . "
i spent two weeks at this retreat in my own little hut -- no music , no nothing , sounds of nature -- trying to find the essence of concentration , being in the moment .
and these little dots , these represent a sort of sound that 's not a vocal , not a lyrical way of expressing the voice .
so , in that sense , it 's a very simple object .
bigger objects have bigger schwarzschild radii .
almost every object in that picture there is a galaxy .
and if that 's the case -- and this is an example of a normal galaxy ; what we see is the star light .
so , i want to see the stars that are as close to the center of the galaxy as possible .
this technology works by introducing a mirror into the telescope optics system that 's continuously changing to counteract what the atmosphere is doing to you .
but with this experiment , we 've confined that same mass to a much smaller volume that 's 10,000 times smaller .
and it 's a very fragile entity .
so this is what we hope to do in the next few years .
this is technology , entertainment , design and there 's a dairy cow .
because what i 've been doing for the last four years , really since the first time you saw me -- some of you saw me at ted when i was talking about religion , and in the last four years i 've been working just about non-stop on this topic .
but also let them know about other religions .
no values , just facts about all the world 's religions .
what a deal .
it was sort of a spooky story .
i wanted to check to find out how he 'd calculated this , and get the sources and so forth .
actually , i 'm going to pass over this .
surrendered people obey god 's words , even if it doesn 't make sense . "
this is a fantastic achievement .
i have some problems with the book .
and then i find this -- " all the evidence available in the biological sciences supports the core proposition that the cosmos is especially designed whole with life and mankind as its fundamental goal and purpose , a whole in which all facets of reality have their meaning and explanation in this central fact . "
" anthropologists have noted that worship is a universal urge , hardwired by god into the very fiber of our being , an inbuilt need to connect with god . "
this discourages the sort of reasoning citizenship it seems to me that we want to have .
contrary to calculations made by some engineers , bees can fly , dolphins can swim , and geckos can even climb up the smoothest surfaces . now , what i want to do , in the short time i have , is to try to allow each of you to experience the thrill of revealing nature 's design .
even the simplest animal we think of , something like an insect , and they have more neurons and connections than you can imagine .
the animals , when you look at them running , appear to be self-stabilizing like this , using basically springy legs . that is , the legs can do computations on their own ; the control algorithms , in a sense , are embedded in the form of the animal itself .
this is an eight-legged scorpion , six-legged ant , forty-four-legged centipede .
robert full : it 'll go on different surfaces -- here 's sand -- although we haven 't perfected the feet yet , but i 'll talk about that later .
you can 't use regular cameras .
and if you look at the toes , they have these little leaves there , and if you blow them up and zoom in , you 'll see that 's there 's little striations in these leaves .
you know , you probably had this a long time ago in chemistry , where you had these two atoms , they 're close together , and the electrons are moving around . that tiny force is sufficient to allow them to do that because it 's added up so many times with these small structures .
as always , i would return to bangalore , and often to animated discussions at friend 's homes , where we would discuss various issues while they complained bitterly about the new pub timings , where a drink often cost more than what they 'd paid their 14-year-old maid .
today the general is a baptized christian evangelist .
liberia is now home to an all-woman united nations contingent of indian peacekeepers .
due to a traffic jam , we were late in getting to a slum , a large slum , which had caught fire .
however , a film we shot still airs on the national geographic channel .
however , there 's more to know about your parent star than just how much light you receive overall .
thank you .
but what to do with this privilege ?
it 's not photoshopped .
the kids are happy , and they love it .
when the rains come , we hurry up to protect our fragile walls against the rain .
when i was a kid , i was going to school , i was coming back every holiday to gando .
two out of three ate the marshmallow .
they had bad grades . some of them dropped out .
then you sell a lot more .
i learned a lot about how to deal with that part of the world .
so , one of our passions in our company , and now one of my personal passions , is to be able to really work hard at making the technology useful , accessible and affordable .
and so when we gave ourselves this scorecard to say well , where are we related to our goal towards 2015 , the thing that becomes apparent is three pieces .
what we mean by that is , you know , frankly , the pc was invented in 1980 , roughly speaking more or less , and for 20-odd years , it hasn 't changed .
i don 't think this segment of the market can be addressed by companies parachuting from another place of the world , and just dumping product and selling into the markets .
we also have partnered with ted in this project , with architecture for humanity , and along with the ted prize winner cameron sinclair , we 're having a contest that we have issued to the architectural community to come up with the best design for a computer lab for an emerging region .
the future of life , where the unraveling of our biology -- and bring up the lights a little bit . i don 't have any slides .
we 're all going to eventually , even in the developed world , going to have to lose everything that we love .
what 's happening is we 're taking this technology -- it 's becoming more precise , more potent -- and we 're turning it back upon ourselves .
but who is going to pay for all this ?
that 's when we 're going to begin to use this knowledge to modify ourselves .
it didn 't happen .
and it won 't be done .
but we shouldn 't kid ourselves and think that we 're going to reach a consensus about these things .
so here we are .
i think that we should be proud of it .
girls outperform boys now at every level , from elementary school to graduate school .
what are the causes ? well , it 's an unintended consequence .
but who should care ? the only people who should care about this is parents of boys and girls , educators , gamers , filmmakers and women who would like a real man who they can talk to , who can dance , who can make love slowly and contribute to the evolutionary pressures to keep our species above banana slugs .
if the monster wants you , the monster 's gonna get you .
because the more things that are familiar , the more things my hands know how to do , the more things that i can be happy and busy doing when my brain 's not running the show anymore .
but if it comes for me , i 'm going to be ready .
because you know what to do about the protests .
and i 'll start with what went right .
we start to like divorcing , if we 're married at all .
this is the other side of the things that we like .
this is why you have checks and balances .
and this is goethe , who is neither bulgarian nor a political scientist , some centuries ago he said , " there is a big shadow where there is much light . "
and here 's how it works . suppose i 'm the experimenter .
it 's a nice motivator .
and what 's alarming here is that our business operating system -- think of the set of assumptions and protocols beneath our businesses , how we motivate people , how we apply our human resources -- it 's built entirely around these extrinsic motivators , around carrots and sticks .
that routine , rule-based , left-brain work -- certain kinds of accounting , certain kinds of financial analysis , certain kinds of computer programming -- has become fairly easy to outsource , fairly easy to automate .
ladies and gentlemen of the jury , some evidence : dan ariely , one of the great economists of our time , he and three colleagues , did a study of some mit students .
let 's go across the pond to the london school of economics -- lse , london school of economics , alma mater of 11 nobel laureates in economics .
okay ? somebody invented it .
that one day of intense autonomy has produced a whole array of software fixes that might never have existed .
a few years later another encyclopedia got started .
we already know this . the science confirms what we know in our hearts .
and she had turned it down , she said , because she was going to start her next business , an entrepreneurship consultancy that would teach business skills to men and women all around afghanistan .
and she was just the start .
nearly everywhere i go , i meet incredibly interesting entrepreneurs who are seeking access to finance , access to markets and established business networks .
just think of the benefits when it comes to jobs , productivity , employment , child nutrition , maternal mortality , literacy and much , much more .
and she told me , " never import other people 's limitations . "
as an architect , i have to confront something like this .
and we know it 's incredibly ugly .
so here we have this piece of music by beethoven , and my problem with it is , it 's boring .
okay ?
i am multitudes .
you can see the mayhem continues , and there 's , you know , there were no clarinets and trumpets and flutes and violins . here 's a piece that has an even more unusual , more peculiar instrumentation .
yeah , okay , that 's kind of weird stuff .
and all of a sudden , out of the dark , from the other end of the square , i saw the glint of mirrors lit by the moon .
i start with the notion of the ideograph .
and as it rises with the strings , i see that it 's a sun .
miranda : do you love me ?
the ideograph that i talked to you about before , what is it for " the tempest " ?
i prefer you to see people moving , and you 're going , " whoa , what was that ? "
and he 's disappeared , this mad french gypsy actor , off in the smoke , and i realize , i can 't go back the way that i 've come . i can 't .
but that doesn 't mean that we can 't .
some teachers completely wrote me off as a lost cause .
but with that , we were going to gain freedom : freedom to hire the teachers that we knew were going to be effective ; freedom to control the curriculum so that we 're not doing lesson 1.2 on page five , no ; and freedom to control a budget , to spend money where it matters , not how a district or a state says you have to do it .
our state test scores have gone up more than 80 points since we 've become our own school .
so , i did it .
here we have savanna giraffes , but through evolution we have this forest giraffe that lives only in congo .
and even people who faced the rebellion of 1963 , after our independence , they didn 't believe what was happening .
i 've been working with him about 10 years .
the second war came while we didn 't expect it .
i say , " no way , you are not going to do it here . "
and he asked me , " do you know how to use this ? "
and i succeeded .
but is gun industries a tool to rebuild , or is it a game ?
many , many of you have seen the talents of africans , but there are few who are going to school .
and i noticed this in a very funny way .
and there are two important messages , or two lessons , to take from that reality .
now these are things about general culture , but i 'm also very much interested in political culture and whether liberty and democracy is appreciated , or whether there 's an authoritarian political culture in which the state is supposed to impose things on the citizens .
but one thing was curious : most of those problems turn out to be problems that emerged later , not from the very divine core of islam , the koran , but from , again , traditions and mentalities , or the interpretations of the koran that muslims made in the middle ages .
and that 's why the ottoman empire in its last decades turned into a proto-democracy , a constitutional monarchy , and freedom was a very important political value at the time .
and when the colonial period ended , what you had in place of that was , generally , secular dictators , which say they 're a country , but did not bring democracy to the country , and established their own dictatorship .
but the pro-e.u. sentiment in turkey in the past decade has become almost an islamic cause and supported by the islamic liberals and the secular liberals as well , of course .
and you could look at this art and you could , of course , see the complex social organization of the people who brought it into being .
there is no progression of affairs in human experience .
their billboards are manuals , prayers to the well-being of all sentient creatures .
you start off at 11,500 feet .
take a direct north-south bearing , you find to your astonishment that it bisects the intiwatana stone , goes to the skyline , hits the heart of salcantay , the second of the most important mountains of the incan empire .
they say , " upon this loom , i weave my life . "
this little boy will never step outside of the sacred fields that surround the men 's hut for all that time , until he begins his journey of initiation .
and what struck me so extraordinary was to be again with the inuit -- a people who don 't fear the cold , but take advantage of it .
right now , as we sit here in this room , of those 6,000 languages spoken the day that you were born , fully half aren 't being taught to children .
when romo wakes up , he 's in creature mode .
so i 'll snap a picture .
but i just want to finish by talking about something that we 're working on in the future .
neither am i a veteran social worker .
so , we started parikrma .
the vocabulary used in those books and the style of writing .
it 's very interesting . when we started our school the parents would give thumbprints in the attendance register .
girl : duke iima camp . whenever we see that iima , it was such a pride for us to go to that camp .
there is an inter-school athletic competition that is held every year in bangalore , where 5,000 children participate from 140 best schools in the city .
he has learned how to speak english .
she said , " what leads to success ? "
physically , mentally , you 've gotta push , push , push . "
thank you tedsters for all your interviews !
so , i have a kind of a simple story , and it suggests that what we want to think about is this thing that we 're making , this thing that has happened in 5,000 days -- that 's all these computers , all these handhelds , all these cell phones , all these laptops , all these servers -- basically what we 're getting out of all these connections is we 're getting one machine .
and the total traffic on this is running at seven terabytes per second .
we think they 're all separate devices , but in fact , every screen in the world is looking into the one machine .
and so every thing will be part of the web .
and i 'm saying , " humans are now going to be the extended senses of the machine , " in a certain sense .
we 're now entering to the third stage , which is what i 'm talking about , and that is where we link the data .
so that 's what you want , is all your friends are identified , and you should just carry these relationships around .
google . i can 't remember my phone number , i 'll just ask google .
and all these devices will be portals into that .
and that 's me with youssou n 'dour , onstage , having the time of my life .
they work in the field .
and in this way , i 've been strengthening my platform and broadening my outreach .
five months later , we went back to south africa to meet avelile again .
but this polyp would continue and tell us that his neighbors were quite clearly identical copies of him .
the rest of physics is about describing what can happen and what can 't .
all of these matter particles come in left- and right-handed varieties , and have anti-particle partners that carry opposite charges .
so when two up quarks and a down quark are combined to make a proton , it has a total electric charge of plus one .
so these patterns of charges are not just pretty .
when we introduce a new direction , we get to guess what charges the particles have along this direction , and then we can rotate it in with the others .
the pattern of this shape living in eight-dimensional charge space is exquisitely beautiful , and it summarizes thousands of possible interactions between these elementary particles , each of which is just a facet of this complicated shape .
if the lhc finds new particles , but they don 't fit this pattern -- well , that will be very interesting , but bad for this e8 theory .
and this is another , and another .
but a string theorist , as i understand it , explains electrons in terms of much smaller strings vibrating -- i know you don 't like string theory -- vibrating inside it .
now as you ponder that question , maybe you 're thinking about the first day of preschool or kindergarten , the first time that kids are in a classroom with a teacher .
but the pregnant woman 's own voice reverberates through her body , reaching the fetus much more readily .
the flavors of the food a pregnant woman eats find their way into the amniotic fluid , which is continuously swallowed by the fetus .
will it be born into a world of abundance or scarcity ?
why would undernutrition in the womb result in disease later ?
when the planes struck and the towers collapsed , many of these women experienced the same horrors inflicted on other survivors of the disaster -- the overwhelming chaos and confusion , the rolling clouds of potentially toxic dust and debris , the heart-pounding fear for their lives .
sousa was not a fan of the talking machines .
as lord blackstone described it , land is protected by trespass law , for most of the history of trespass law , by presuming it protects the land all the way down below and to an indefinite extent upward .
and the important point to recognize is that even though these broadcasters were broadcasting something you would call second best , that competition was enough to break , at that time , this legal cartel over access to music .
and i ....
you 're a trespasser with about as much sense as these people were trespassers .
but let me end with something i think much more important -- much more important than business .
here are a few quotes indicating that : " man has no nature , " from the historian jose ortega y gasset ; " man has no instincts , " from the anthropologist ashley montagu ; " the human brain is capable of a full range of behaviors and predisposed to none , " from the late scientist stephen jay gould .
as you can see , there are two inventors with identical contraptions in their lap , meeting in the waiting room of a patent attorney .
in the book , i go over controversies such as this one , and a number of other hot buttons , hot zones , chernobyls , third rails , and so on -- including the arts , cloning , crime , free will , education , evolution , gender differences , god , homosexuality , infanticide , inequality , marxism , morality , nazism , parenting , politics , race , rape , religion , resource depletion , social engineering , technological risk and war .
let me start with the arts .
students are staying away in droves , universities are disinvesting in the arts and humanities .
what a puzzle -- i wonder why .
that would make them super-similar , right ?
and he said that he could actually see an x-ray of his fingers , because the light was so bright .
so i decided to do this symbolic swim at the top of the world , in a place which should be frozen over , but which now is rapidly unfreezing .
i had to see my coach screaming for me , " come on lewis ! come on ! go ! go ! go ! don 't slow down ! "
and they had burst . and i was in so much agony .
and at worst , i didn 't even want to think about it .
just scuttle forward and go for it . "
lp : thank you very much . thank you very much .
we 've come a long way . we 're doing good .
and then came one of the biggest guilt trips of my life .
so i looked carefully at this guy .
i wasn 't doing something bad .
yet i still hadn 't saved a single life .
this is four billion hours wasted in this country alone .
so , let 's look at the proof .
it 's in noaa , the national oceanic and atmospheric administration .
we were looking for something and found something else .
do the math , i 'm 66 . and i went out to sea on a scripps ship and we almost got sunk by a giant rogue wave , and i was too young to be -- you know , i thought it was great !
it 's absolutely pitch black , because photons cannot reach the average depth of the ocean , which is 12,000 feet . in the rift valley , it 's 9,000 feet .
so , we came up with multiple hypotheses : there 's little green people down there taking it ; there 's all sorts of things going on .
their bodies had been totally taken over by another organism , a bacterium , that had figured out how to replicate photosynthesis in the dark , through a process we now call chemosynthesis .
and the hydrothermal vents were in an acidic environment .
how many ancient mariners have had a bad day ? the number 's a million .
but we have no idea what we 're going find when we go out there with our technology .
we can disseminate .
and the technology is at hand .
and it was a big thing in my little community of point reyes station in inverness , california , because there were only about 350 people there in the winter – this was back in ' 71 now .
and i have to tell you , it was a very moving experience , because for the first time , i began listening -- in a long time .
you don 't … ?
and what we 're going to do is , we 're going to have all of the professors allow you to go to class .
i just backed out of that , you know , and i just kind of kept the fists from flying .
and that 's communication .
i 'd studied environment at this formal level , but there was this informal level .
i was a prisoner and i needed to escape .
so if my voice can touch you , if my actions can touch you , if my being here can touch you , please let it be .
it 's understanding data .
it 's incredible , because i couldn 't believe my eyes when i once just happened to bump into him .
but what does this new , sort of , approach give us ?
basically one of the contexts that we studied was schools in very remote parts of india .
and we systematically field tested , because in the field testing we learned some important lessons , and we went through many iterations .
how do we empower her with simple tools that 's not diagnostic but more screening in nature so she at least knows how to advise the patients better ?
vv : so ...
we are very happy because we have the opportunity to have this angel in the world -- not only in our country , venezuela , but in our world .
so we normally think of programs as being complicated things that we build for very specific purposes .
it 's not at all what we 're used to , and i must say that , when i first saw this , it came as a huge shock to my intuition .
and last year we were able to release the first website version of wolfram alpha .
and what 's happening here is that wolfram alpha is not just looking up something ; it 's computing , in real time , where the international space station is right now at this moment , how fast it 's going , and so on .
i mean , everything is scaling up very nicely and we 're getting more confident .
but actually i think the most exciting thing about this is that it really gives one the chance to democratize programming .
well , so , that leads to kind of an ultimate question : could it be that someplace out there in the computational universe we might find our physical universe ?
and i 'm not sure what the best way to organize the whole thing is .
i view benoit mandelbrot 's work as one of the founding contributions to this kind of area .
it seemed so intuitive to me .
and his communication and social interaction were improved so dramatically that he was enrolled into a regular school and even became a karate super champ .
and without them we wouldn 't be here .
and we decided that what we want to store first of all , are the species that are most under threat .
and that enables us to develop germination protocols .
i think that 's cheap , at the price .
wow , you guys are great .
the nerds here , they get laid -- except for the lady with the condoms in her pocket -- and you say to yourself at some point , " am i part of this group ? like , am i into this ? "
and some people will fund their entire lego habit by selling the little guy , but then you have no guys in your ships .
that was a decision based on love and responsibility .
and caregiving itself develops patience -- a lot of patience -- and empathy , creativity , resilience , adaptability .
they love being mothers , but they also love their work , and they 're really good at what they do .
the feminist revolution still has a long way to go .
that was completely unthinkable 50 or even 30 years ago .
my name is lovegrove . i only know nine lovegroves , two of which are my parents .
industrial design is the art form of the 21st century .
it felt like nothing . it has to feel like nothing .
how do you condense that ?
this is a detail of a chair that i 've designed in magnesium .
wow . let 's go for it . that 's the kind of stuff .
it 's for a company called moroso in italy .
how you grow legs out of a surface .
how ridiculous is that ? couldn 't you make that from 300 ?
i 'm trying to build furniture that fits architecture .
it 's in notting hill next to all the crap -- you know , the prostitutes and all that stuff .
the first sculptural model i made for that thing in tokyo .
thank you , james , for your great inspiration .
here 's an example of one of these objects .
here 's a replica of one such seal .
we don 't know , but perhaps if you deciphered the script , you would be able to answer this question .
the first thing that you need to do when you have an undeciphered script is try to figure out the direction of writing .
and this in turn tends to be followed by this quotation marks-like symbol .
so imagine a monkey sitting at a keyboard .
my students said that i should really seriously consider getting some protection .
and what seems to have happened here is that the indus traders , the merchants , were using this script to write a foreign language .
my colleagues , iravatham mahadevan and asko parpola , have been making some headway on this particular problem .
the indus civilization does not belong to just the south indians or the north indians or the pakistanis ; it belongs to all of us .
bj : well we certainly did spend a lot of time with her -- in fact , more time than even her mother did .
and we could only find this by pushing ourselves , by going where no sane person should go -- not without some prompting , by the way , from beverly -- and just pushing the envelope , going out there , pushing our vehicle , pushing ourselves .
this sort of behavior has been going on for three , four , five million years , and we can 't step in and say , " that 's wrong , and that 's right . "
we were perhaps taking her for granted , and maybe she didn 't like that that much .
it was absolutely amazing when she picked it up to safety , protecting it from the hyena .
and that 's not the only leopards that were being killed through that period .
there 's an 80-billion-dollar-a-year ecotourism revenue stream into africa .
a bit better .
today , i am standing on the ted stage with the yo-yo in front of you .
and perfumery shows you that can 't be true , because if it were like that it wouldn 't be an art , ok ?
now , this is a totally insane idea .
this is cis-3-hexene-1-thiol , and this smells of rotten eggs , ok ?
now , after searching high and low for several months , i discovered that there was a type of molecule called a borane which has exactly the same vibration .
now , i could do the dance of electron tunneling , but i 've done a video instead , which is much more interesting . here 's how it works .
and the problem is it 's a carcinogen .
and : you 're completely wrong , and i 'm sure you 're completely wrong .
education : how do we improve education ?
and there 's this great novel that arthur clarke wrote twice , called " against the fall of night " and " the city and the stars . "
and so maybe if we lived 200 years , we could accumulate enough skills and knowledge to solve some problems .
and so if you think of yourself as a sort of city with a hundred resources , then , when you 're afraid , for example , you may discard your long-range goals , but you may think deeply and focus on exactly how to achieve that particular goal .
well i built a fusion reactor when i was 14 years old .
oh , by the way , i make yellowcake in my garage , so my nuclear program is as advanced as the iranians .
we didn 't -- a lot of flying , a lot of experiments , a lot of things that didn 't work , and ones that did work , and the plane kept getting a little better , a little better .
and so , the year 2000 , you see there .
we 're in charge . it 's frightening .
eventually , it will be able to have to stay up day , night , day , night , for six months at a time , acting like the synchronous satellite , but only ten miles above the earth .
tm : 12 , something like that .
then the second part will really just be examples of new technologies -- new media falling very much into that mold .
but it , in some sense , misses the point : namely , that fingers are a very , very high-resolution input medium .
and it 's pressure-sensitive to the forces both in the plane of the screen -- x , y , and z at least in one direction ; we couldn 't figure out how to come in the other direction .
filmmakers , for example , are the experts in monologue making : you make a film and it has a well-formed beginning , middle and end , and in some sense the art of it is that .
now , i don 't even know what vintage the transmission is , but let me just show you very quickly some of it , and we 'll move on .
but teaching kids programming per se is utterly irrelevant .
there is a myth , and it truly is a myth : we believe -- and i 'm sure a lot of you believe in this room -- that it is harder to read and write than it is to learn how to speak .
and the reason it remains a favorite project is that we were asked to do a teleconferencing system where you had the following situation : you had five people at five different sites -- they were known people -- and you had to have these people in teleconference , such that each one was utterly convinced that the other four were physically present .
that thing is called a captcha .
but then i started feeling bad .
now scanning a book is like taking a digital photograph of every page of the book .
facebook : every time you add a friend or poke somebody , you help to digitize a book .
here 's how it works .
let me tell you about one that i 'm most excited about .
why can 't we use machine translation ?
so we need people to translate the whole web .
but then we realized , there 's actually a way to solve both these problems with the same solution .
and they learn it about as well as the leading language learning software .
since all the projects that my group has worked on so far have gotten millions of users , we 're hopeful that we 'll be able to translate extremely fast with this project .
and so , if you 'll put up with this , i would like to enlist your help with a first experiment today . the experiment is -- and i notice , by the way , that when you applauded , that you did it in a typical north american way , that is , you were raucous and incoherent .
but there is a countervailing force in the universe -- the tendency towards spontaneous order . and so that 's our theme .
now , all this changes when a predator enters the scene .
we don 't , however , really understand at a mathematical level .
no one believed them .
now comes the very risky part of my talk , which is to demonstrate that inanimate things can synchronize .
i also want to wind this one up a bit . how can they communicate ?
so i want to first show you some interviews with people who were on the bridge on opening day , who will describe what happened .
interviewer : were they deliberately walking in step , or anything like that ?
but how could the crowd become synchronized ?
their instructions : just walk normally .
i think it comes when we start to value the gift of a near win .
how many times have we designated something a classic , a masterpiece even , while its creator considers it hopelessly unfinished , riddled with difficulties and flaws , in other words , a near win ?
one of the most vivid examples of this comes when we look at the difference between olympic silver medalists and bronze medalists after a competition .
this is the dynamic of mastery .
my main tool is an underwater video with a hydrophone , which is an underwater microphone , and this is so i can correlate sound and behavior .
now , we do know some things about how sounds are used with certain behaviors .
the males have dominance displays that they use when they 're chasing each other 's females .
they were spontaneously mimicking our vocalizations and our postures , and they were also inviting us into dolphin games .
now this is video of a session .
and the diver there is going to activate the scarf sound to request the scarf .
we hope so and we think so .
this is a shop for a bag company .
and so we were commissioned to design a bridge that would open .
and so we spent time traveling with them and learning about all the different elements , and finding that there were plenty of inefficiencies that weren 't being capitalized on .
so we won the competition to build the u.k. pavilion .
so we realized we had to make a project that would be seeds , some kind of seed cathedral .
and with a million people there a day , it just felt like offering some public space .
and it 's in a piece of land that 's this site .
and so the daylight was just coming -- it was caught on the outside of the box and was coming down to illuminate each seed .
here 's what happened to this company .
if you lost , you died .
it 's a phenomenon that i think any organization or individual can tap into .
it 's not as if j.j. and jill actually ended their talks saying , " step your game up , " but they might as well have .
best dancer walks tall , gets the best date .
and , very happily , there 's one class of people who really can 't make use of this tool .
it 's also not news to say that the internet has accelerated innovation .
and a global community of unicyclists discover each other online , inspire each other to greatness .
and in that non-verbal portion , there 's some serious magic .
for the first time in human history , talented students don 't have to have their potential and their dreams written out of history by lousy teachers .
i mean , that would take more teachers than we 've ever had .
they are using flip cameras to record , edit , and reporting to their own channel , kibera tv .
" light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history . "
what 's significant to the story of human skin pigmentation is just how much of the northern hemisphere is in these cool gray zones .
where it protected the body against the degradations of ultraviolet radiation , the destruction , or damage to dna , and the breakdown of a very important molecule called folate , which helps to fuel cell production , and reproduction in the body .
humans have been on the move for a long time .
and the social consequences , as we know , are incredibly profound .
he would appreciate it .
the doors open , the kids descend on this table of legs , and they are poking and prodding , and they 're wiggling toes , and they 're trying to put their full weight on the sprinting leg to see what happens with that .
well , lucky for me , a lot of people answered that call .
poetry matters .
her mouth dropped open when she saw me , and she went , " but you 're so tall ! "
and having grown up in a segregated city , baltimore , maryland , i sort of use that idea to go around america with a tape recorder -- thank god for technology -- to interview people , thinking that if i walked in their words -- which is also why i don 't wear shoes when i perform -- if i walked in their words , that i could sort of absorb america .
just as a train is about to go , a young couple rush in and they 're just about to close the pneumatic doors .
' anybody up on that raft with you ? ' huck says , ' yeah . ' ' is he black or white ? ' ' white . ' and they go off .
and i got this in the maryland correctional institute for women .
i didn 't even go and see what was happening .
and he just laid her right on the shoulder of the highway .
" i used to believe america was the best .
i was glad for them . at least they got something back , ok .
it seems like he has so much bad luck , you know .
it 's like , you know , racking up our credit cards on entry fees and gas .
followed by that , you see on the west coast planes moving across , the red-eye flights to the east coast .
and you can see , over time , the ways the airports change .
and it 's this amazing robot that plays chess extremely well , except for one thing : it 's not a robot at all .
i think there 's something really interesting to watching people as they go through this creative toil -- something we can all relate to , this creative process of trying to come up with something from nothing .
it 's about your own interpretation and doing something different . "
here on the right-hand side in the middle you see this one guy writing , " $ 0.01 ! ! ! really ? "
so if you go to the bicyclebuiltfortwothousand.com you can actually hear what all this sounds like together .
the lyrics to the leading track are " ain 't no grave can hold my body down . "
you 're hearing a person 's life .
what if we had a very low commitment , but delivered something individually unique to each person who contributed ?
now the theme of this year 's ted conference is full spectrum .
so that means that certain parts of the periodic table are axiomatically off-limits .
and i did .
it 's pretty cool , at least in theory .
and then it was onto the saucer .
liquid metal battery is designed to operate at elevated temperature with minimum regulation .
and pepsi came to howard and they said , " you know , there 's this new thing called aspartame , and we would like to make diet pepsi .
and suddenly , like a bolt of lightning , the answer came to him .
the quality of the tomato paste is much better ; the spice mix is far superior ; it adheres to the pasta in a much more pleasing way . in fact , they would do the famous bowl test back in the ' 70s with ragu and prego .
let 's see if they congregate around certain ideas .
as howard loves to say , " the mind knows not what the tongue wants . "
they put it in a little tiny glass jar , with a wonderful enameled label on it , made it look french , even though it 's made in oxnard , california .
you go to chez panisse , they give you the red-tail sashimi with roasted pumpkin seeds in a something something reduction .
but that changed , right ?
i got here 12 years ago , and when i got here , i was told various things , like , " americans don 't get irony . "
what it doesn 't count are all the kids who are in school but being disengaged from it , who don 't enjoy it , who don 't get any real benefit from it .
what schools are encouraged to do is to find out what kids can do across a very narrow spectrum of achievement .
now the reason i say this is because one of the effects of the current culture here , if i can say so , has been to de-professionalize teachers .
the role of a teacher is to facilitate learning . that 's it .
and your dog may get depressed .
why would you drop out ?
it happens in classrooms and schools , and the people who do it are the teachers and the students , and if you remove their discretion , it stops working .
what 's interesting to me is , these are called " alternative education . "
the real role of leadership in education -- and i think it 's true at the national level , the state level , at the school level -- is not and should not be command and control .
we don 't know for really basically any of the clinics in the developing world , which ones have medicines and which ones don 't .
this is the data from a single vaccination coverage survey in a single district in the country of zambia from a few years ago that i participated in .
so back in 1995 , i began to think about ways in which we could improve this process .
but the problem is , 20 or 30 programs , like , training 20 or 30 programs to use this technology , that is a tiny drop in the bucket .
it 's always guys that look pretty much like me flying from countries that look pretty much like this to other countries with people with darker skin .
no one has to speak to me .
they understand this is the most significant intervention they can make . they used to track the dispersements , the attendance , the grades , on paper .
it may still be , for all i know .
but i was at a ted event recently and esther duflo , probably one of the leading experts in , effectively , the eradication of poverty in the developing world , actually spoke .
actually , what happens in the world increasingly -- now , all credit to the british airport authority .
and you 're pretty rich by the standards of the world at large .
i thought it was very indecent of accenture to ditch tiger woods in such a sort of hurried and hasty way .
later , i understood why my father got so upset .
the first key shift is open knowledge .
to tackle this problem , governments are using new tools to visualize the budget so it 's more understandable to the public .
we need to radically open up development so knowledge flows in multiple directions , inspiring practitioners , so aid becomes transparent , accountable and effective , so governments open up and citizens are engaged and empowered with reformers in government .
so a few of the stories .
and my story is about these tradeoffs .
[ 27 % of subjects ' first 5 ssn digits identified ] but in fact , we even decided to develop an iphone app which uses the phone 's internal camera to take a shot of a subject and then upload it to a cloud and then do what i just described to you in real time : looking for a match , finding public information , trying to infer sensitive information , and then sending back to the phone so that it is overlaid on the face of the subject , an example of augmented reality , probably a creepy example of augmented reality .
discrimination was happening through social media for equally skilled candidates .
transparency . notification . and sure enough , this worked , in the sense that the first group of subjects were much more likely to disclose than the second .
which brings me back to the garden of eden .
right now , many of us do not even know that the fight is going on , but it is , whether you like it or not .
how do you introduce the concept of running to a nation that is constantly at the brink of war ?
but we did have a marathon .
we are now one of the largest running events in the middle east , but most importantly , it is a platform for hope and cooperation in an ever-fragile and unstable part of the world .
and they share this great splendor with a very large pig .
what we saw was a natural experiment .
there are , true enough , in europe and the west , when women and men have equal access to food and health care , there are more women , we live longer .
so research has shown , if you look at people who live under two dollars a day -- one metric of poverty -- two percent of that take-home pay goes to this basket here , in education .
and if you look at another factor , another contrast , a slave back then is worth about $ 40,000 in today 's money .
so finally , they put her at the edge of the village in a hut .
well , when she had her second daughter , her mother in-law told her son , " i think you 'd better get a second wife .
they made a donation to an organization based in arkansas called heifer international .
when i was in zimbabwe , we were touring a place with the village chief -- he wanted to raise money for a secondary school -- and there was some construction a few yards away , and i said , " what 's that ? "
she was in her grandmother 's backyard , and she saw something that made her break down in tears .
so , for instance , if you ask , how many diseases do we now know the exact molecular basis ?
ultimately , maybe you can run a clinical trial with four or five of these , and if all goes well , 14 years after you started , you will get one approval .
i want to tell you about another disorder .
francis collins : so what would you like to say to researchers here in the auditorium and others listening to this ?
it didn 't work very well for cancer , but became the first successful antiretroviral , and you can see from the table there are others as well .
so let me sum up .
i explored the human skin , and how technology can transform the body .
it 's perfume coming from the inside out .
it 's totally almost just like that .
that , by the way , in case you 're paying attention , is not emotionally correct .
i 'm not perfect , but what i am is optimistic , because i don 't just get hate mail .
and i want to argue that what we do is we try to change everything .
nathan left and went to tompkins county , new york -- a place as different from san francisco as you can be and still be in the united states . and he did it again .
you can change the fabric of an entire country .
but there is good news around the corner -- really good news .
and that what firemen do to train sometimes is they take a house that is going to be torn down , and they burn it down instead , and practice putting it out .
what they did , though , is each in their own way , created a different way of navigating your way through technology .
derek sivers invented cd baby , which allowed independent musicians to have a place to sell their music without selling out to the man -- to have place to take the mission they already wanted to go to , and connect with each other .
she does it by telling a story to people who want to hear it .
not fighting the organization that 's fighting it -- fighting with them , leading them , connecting them , challenging the status quo because it 's important to him .
they commit to the cause . they commit to the tribe .
this past may was the warmest worldwide on record .
each cylinder is a parfait of time .
the scientists must insure that the ice is not contaminated .
what happens when the number of vehicles on the road doubles , triples , or even quadruples ?
but my great grandfather , henry ford , really believed that the mission of the ford motor company was to make people 's lives better and make cars affordable so that everyone could have them .
and i 'll never forget the day i was called in by a member of top management and told to stop associating with any known or suspected environmentalists .
now think about the impact that this is going to have on our daily lives .
we are going to build smart cars , but we also need to build smart roads , smart parking , smart public transportation systems and more .
but very soon we 're going to see the days when cars are essentially talking to each other .
this isn 't going to be solved by any one person or one group .
i left when i was 25 years old to go to bali , and there i met my incredible wife , cynthia , and together , over 20 years , we built an amazing jewelry business .
our children spend 181 days going to school in a box .
when the turbine drops in , it will produce 8,000 watts of electricity , day and night .
he said , " i had a dream once about a green school , and i saw a picture of this green school , i got on an airplane .
we dropped them gently in .
the kids love it .
when the architects came , they brought us these things , and you 've probably seen things like this .
you ruined my life , but you gave me an incredible future .
i need to explain a little bit about monsoons .
they lay the eggs into fresh water .
if you 're going to study dragonflies , you want to study those really bright beautiful ones , like that red one . or the really rare ones , the endemic endangered ones .
because dragonflies need fresh water to breed .
those of you who grew up in india , do you remember in your childhood , dragonflies , swarms of dragonflies ? maybe at school , maybe tying little bits of string onto them ?
maldives is a long archipelago .
and they 're here for a very short time , october , november , december . that 's it .
what on earth are they doing ?
now , this is southeast africa . it makes it look like there are sort of two breeding periods here . it 's slightly more complicated than that .
there 's a convergence . so , wherever the rain is falling , the air is drawn towards it to replace the air that 's rising .
which is an area along the amur river , which is up here .
it comes with the monsoons .
many things have been said about this .
however , if we 'd had this talk 60 years ago , we would have seen how the emergence of new aircraft and tank technologies , which give the advantage to the attacker , make the blitzkrieg doctrine very credible and thus create the possibility of war in europe .
in this context , when you don 't know if the potential enemy is preparing for defense or attack , and if the weapons give an advantage to attacking , then this environment is most likely to spark a conflict .
i 'll bet you didn 't even know you 're using african technology .
so where it 's happening is in africa .
by the way , you can update facebook and send gmail from a phone like this .
so back to joburg , which is sometimes called egoli , which means city of gold .
besides , a human being is not a brain on a stick .
namely , we seem to be getting more humane .
but all on its own , it 's a feeble instrument for making moral progress .
eventually their conclusions get absorbed into the common sense of decency , erasing the tracks of the original argument that had gotten us there .
one man 's safety is owing to the destruction of another .
rng : and the persecution of homosexuals .
sp : what about religious faith in general ?
come with me to the wonderful world of statistics .
so this is a limitation .
they start [ in ] 1990 -- they measure to 2009 .
so they calculate the percent annual growth rate of [ the ] economy .
ghana got very ahead , fast .
sweden achieved a low child mortality because we started early .
here we have a problem .
and here brazil is in the western box .
this is crap .
last january , my company , fark.com , was sued along with yahoo , msn , reddit , aol , techcrunch and others by a company called gooseberry natural resources .
and in discovery phase , we asked the patent troll to please provide screenshots of fark where the infringement of their patent was actually occurring .
patents are very difficult to overturn .
so unfortunately i 'm not smart enough to have a solution for the patent troll problem .
it 's from the senate .
because it turned out we 're not really couch potatoes .
plan b appeared in its first full-blown form in 1998 -- something called the digital millennium copyright act .
now the mechanism , as i said , for doing this , is you need to take out anybody pointing to those ip addresses .
these industries will not be content with breaking our internet .
time warner has called and they want us all back on the couch , just consuming -- not producing , not sharing -- and we should say , " no . "
they don 't have roots that go into trunks nor to the forest floor .
well , when we look out , you and i , over that canopy of the intact primary forest , what we see is this enormous carpet of carbon .
and my feeling is -- thank you .
we went out to the forest , i would pick up a branch , caution would rap on it , and suddenly that branch was really cool .
because the prison wardens were very enthusiastic about this as well , i started a science and sustainability seminar in the prisons .
finally , as a scientist and as a person and now , as part of the ted community , i feel that i have better tools to go out to trees , to go out to forests , to go out to nature , to make new discoveries about nature -- and about humans ' place in nature wherever we are and whomever you are .
case in point , this march , the new york times ran a story by james mckinley about a gang rape of a young girl , 11 years old , in a small texas town .
perhaps the addition of ms. goode is what made this story more complete .
chris anderson , the editor of wired , defended his choice and said , there aren 't enough women , prominent women in technology to sell a cover , to sell an issue .
he used to work for two editors who said every story had to have at least one female source .
it 's actually long before i ever thought about becoming a journalist , but i was very interested in how we learn to perceive our world .
and the exhaustion of mothers who had taken two , three , sometimes four buses to bring their child to the doctor was just palpable .
and so many of his patients came in presenting with malnutrition that be began prescribing food for them .
what if we decided to take all the parts of healthcare that have drifted away from us and stand firm and say , " no .
so on the one hand , this is just a basic recoding of the electronic medical record .
it requires a non-clinical army of community health workers and case managers and many others .
when i write a prescription , i think , can the family read the prescription ?
it will not be by the excellence of our technologies or the sophistication of our specialists , but by how rarely we needed them .
for christmas i got a magic box and a very old book on card manipulation .
i befriend a young juggler in a juggling troupe , and he agrees to sell me three clubs .
so i went to the circus to see more magicians , more jugglers , and i saw -- oh no , no , no , i didn 't see .
i was starting to invent my own moves and bring them to perfection .
but it is too late .
so what should i share ? oh , i know . israel .
but the bird , instead of flying away , goes flop , flop , flop and lands on my head .
they had become one , pushing me to triumph .
and they 're questions that i 've asked of science television producers , of audiences of science educators -- so that 's science teachers -- and also of seven-year-olds , and i find that the seven-year-olds do marginally better than the other audiences , which is somewhat surprising .
the mass of this comes out of the air .
but if you haven 't played with a battery and a bulb , if you 've only seen a circuit diagram , you might not be able to do that , and that 's one of the problems .
what would you do if you knew that people had this misconception , right , in their heads , of elliptical orbits caused by our experiences as children ?
they come with their own ideas and their own theories , and unless you work with those , then you won 't be able to shift them , right ? and i probably haven 't shifted your ideas of how the world and universe operates , either .
thank you very much .
now , it turns out there are neurons which are called ordinary motor command neurons in the front of the brain , which have been known for over 50 years .
and that is , there is a sudden emergence and rapid spread of a number of skills that are unique to human beings like tool use , the use of fire , the use of shelters , and , of course , language , and the ability to read somebody else 's mind and interpret that person 's behavior .
i mean , i empathize with that person but i don 't literally feel the touch .
for the longest time people have regarded science and humanities as being distinct .
1939 , that 's when they discovered oil .
the average growth of our economy is about 15 percent for the past five years .
simply because of this gigantic , mammoth machine called desalination .
this is the situation in qatar , for those who don 't know .
that water will go then to the farmers , and the farmers will be able to water their plants , and they will be able then to supply society with food .
all easier said than done .
and i want to say that the head of our aids effort , and the person who also is primarily active in the wish i 'll make tonight , ira magaziner , is here with me and i want to thank him for everything he 's done .
we tried to do the same thing by negotiating industry-right deals with the soft drink and the snack food industry to cut the caloric and other dangerous content of food going to our children in the schools .
and the test is : one , will it do the job ?
and the results were so good that the rwandan government has now agreed to adopt the model for the entire country , and has strongly supported and put the full resources of the government behind it .
less than three-tenths of one percent had to transfer to the more expensive second-line drugs .
we 're undoing that now , and they are so over it and so into their future .
actually , he was meditating on compassion .
i know there are other compassionate companies in the world , but google is the place i 'm familiar with because i 've been there for 10 years , so i 'll use google as the case study .
and this idea , again , came from the grassroots , from two googlers who wrote their own job descriptions and volunteered themselves for the job .
and if you look at these qualities in the context of compassion , we find that the cognitive and affective components of compassion -- understanding people and empathizing with people -- inhibits , tones down , what i call the excessive self-obsession that 's in us , therefore creating the conditions for humility .
and one of our most popular managers jokes that , this is what he says , " google is a place where the inmates run the asylum . "
it means being able to observe our thought stream and the process of emotion with high clarity , objectivity and from a third-person perspective .
as an industrial engineer , cum aspiring and then successful entrepreneur .
so the equation is conceptual .
over the same span of time sales have increased by two-thirds and profits have doubled .
a better business model , a better way to bigger profits .
that a is a capital a , suggesting that affluence is an end in itself .
he was sending me an original poem that he had composed after our tuesday morning together .
it was a machine that was never built , and yet , it will be built .
and i 'm going to take you through the architecture of the machine — that 's why it 's computer architecture — and tell you about this machine , which is a computer .
and there 's not just one of these , there 's many of them .
this lady is the daughter of the mad , bad and dangerous-to-know lord byron , and her mother , being a bit worried that she might have inherited some of lord byron 's madness and badness , thought , " i know the solution : mathematics is the solution .
turing 's machine was entirely theoretical .
that 's been done . the second is now the study of all of those plans to determine what to build .
we want to navigate , explore , discover information .
so a little unknown secret is -- did you see the one with the guy , he 's got the web cam ?
we took a decimal point off what it cost to build these cities , and that 's how we 're going to be able to scale this out and make this reality a dream .
another beautifully designed new building ruined by the sound of a common wall light switch .
it 's why they leave lights on around the house .
the temporary building is a triumph of modern industrial organization , a healthy sublimation of the urge to build , and proof that not every architectural idea need be set in stone .
the lap of luxury is an architectural construct of childhood , which we seek , in vain , as adults , to employ .
most people , when they first look at a fresh human brain , they say , " it doesn 't look what you 're typically looking at when someone shows you a brain . "
you can see areas where neuronal cell bodies are being stained .
the unique character of both individual neurons and neurons within a collection of the brain are driven by fundamental properties of their underlying biochemistry .
and we 're very careful about the brains that we do take .
so this is where experts come in and they make basic anatomic assignments .
you can see that blue dot there cutting . and that tissue falls off .
you 'll start to recognize these things from what we 've collected before .
we can do that in multiple individuals that we 've assayed too .
we 're similar at the genetic level .
but we only looked at a handful of individuals at this point .
shipping brings us 90 percent of world trade .
now that 's because shipping is very efficient .
there were double pirate watches .
and a north atlantic right whale can transmit across hundreds of miles .
it happens when there 's a thickening in the pulmonary veins , making the right side of the heart work overtime , and causing what i call the reverse-grinch effect .
mine was 146 .
he was a big figure in all of our lives , and we loved him very much .
thankfully , in a few minutes , i saw the signature hive-like rash appear on my legs , which is a side effect of the medication , and i knew i 'd be okay .
it was my doctor in cleveland , marie budev .
so my own surgeon performed the procedure in a last-ditch attempt to save my voice .
and i 'd like to thank my pianist , monica lee .
the idea is to try to provide some measure of physical comfort while you 're down there , otherwise in damp , moist , cold conditions in utterly dark places .
number one , it 's the name of my rock band , and second , is because the confrontation of these things forced me to become an inventor .
there was a brief clip -- a mission to explore under the ice of europa would be the ultimate robotic challenge .
there are more stages involved here than i 've got time to tell you about , but basically we drive through the space , we populate it with environmental variables -- sulphide , halide , things like that .
and i hope you 'll bear with me and have some faith that there 's credibility behind what we 're going to say here .
in fact , you can get it better -- you can get it at 14 times lower if you can find propellant on the moon .
you can dive into the stratosphere , and precisely dissipate that velocity , and come back out to the space station .
it can be done in seven years with the right backing .
i 'm canadian , and i 'm the youngest of seven kids .
this youngest of seven had to get herself to the front of the line .
i worked alone .
we were also playing with sms at the time at odeo , so we kind of put two and two together , and in early 2006 we launched twitter as a side project at odeo .
in fact , there are 47 members of congress who currently have twitter accounts .
one of my favorites is what happened a few months ago when there was a gas shortage in atlanta .
evan williams : nice . thanks .
just look at google maps here . there 's block 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 .
good morning everybody .
these electrodes act like mini pacemakers to get the cells to contract in the lab .
let 's remember that our cells sustain our lives in a very real way .
what this means is our economy is unsustainable .
well , it 's mostly true .
and that 's what will happen to us .
i know most people don 't see it that way .
imagine what you 'll tell your children when they ask you , " so , in 2012 , mom and dad , what was it like when you 'd had the hottest decade on record for the third decade in a row , when every scientific body in the world was saying you 've got a major problem , when the oceans were acidifying , when oil and food prices were spiking , when they were rioting in the streets of london and occupying wall street ?
after the bombing of pearl harbor , it just took four days for the government to ban the production of civilian cars and to redirect the auto industry , and from there to rationing of food and energy .
but fear can be paralyzing or motivating .
they fly , not with rotating components , so they fly only by flapping their wings .
and if we now beat up and down ...
at this very moment , you are viewing my upper half .
from the ease with which you swept away obstacles that no one knew could even be budged .
he knew , in ireland , that his son would live , and that in ethiopia , his son would die .
this is about justice . really .
we 're standing around with watering cans , when what we really need is the fire brigade .
it 's not spin . it 's not wishful thinking .
but that 's just the easy part , or ought to be .
but i want to argue that this is the moment that you are designed for .
the clash wore big army boots , not sandals .
but some of them they haven 't .
but there 's also our sense of ourselves .
anyway , here 's number one .
could be on google , could be on aol .
we can make history .
but wireless technology wasn 't dreamt up then .
however , cities , despite having this negative aspect to them , are also the solution .
is microsoft a great big anthill ?
here 's how you grew .
despite the fact that this is the most complex and diverse system in the universe , there 's an extraordinary simplicity being expressed by this .
one of the things i did not stress in that introduction was that , systematically , the pace of life decreases as you get bigger .
it 's an integrated system that has evolved despite all the planning and so on .
something universal is going on .
so there 's this continuous cycle of innovation that is necessary in order to sustain growth and avoid collapse .
but you notice , i 've cheated , because i 've only gone up to ' 94 .
i can 't get my father in italy to work on the internet .
in this case i 'm showing more the designers ' work , because they 're the ones that have really been stimulated .
so this particular student , james king , went around the beautiful english countryside , picked the best , best cow that he could see , and then put her in the mri machine .
another aspect of contemporary design that i think is mind-opening , promising and will really be the future of design , is the idea of collective design .
and then the dream is that you 'll be able to , from home , customize your chair . you know , companies and designers will be designing the matrix or the margins that respect both solidity and brand , and design identity .
they 're still very useful .
one of the most beautiful things is that designers really work on life , even though they take technology into account .
whenever there is an election , it seems like something always goes wrong , someone tries to cheat , or something goes accidentally awry -- a ballot box goes missing here , chads are left hanging over here .
well , the way we 've come up with uses computers but doesn 't depend on them .
but the election magic doesn 't stop there .
they completely interrupt the communication between the brain and the spinal cord , thus leading to complete and permanent paralysis of the leg .
it turned out that there are known neural pathways coming from the brain that play this very function during locomotion .
the robot provided the safe environment to allow the rat to attempt anything to engage the paralyzed legs .
we did not aim to repair the spinal cord , yet we were able to promote one of the more extensive remodeling of axonal projections ever observed in the central nervous system of adult mammal after an injury .
but not to replace the lost function , no -- to help the brain help itself .
a snob is anybody who takes a small part of you and uses that to come to a complete vision of who you are .
never before have expectations been so high about what human beings can achieve with their lifespan .
and yet , they 're not .
you know , in the middle ages , in england , when you met a very poor person , that person would be described as an " unfortunate " -- literally , somebody who had not been blessed by fortune , an unfortunate .
in modern english that would mean it 's a sin to come to any view of who you should talk to dependent on their business card .
i think the western tradition shows us one glorious alternative , and that is tragedy .
we think very highly of ourselves , and so we should .
we hear a lot of talk about work-life balance .
let 's make sure our ideas of success are truly our own .
thank you very much .
so if you want connecticut , go , c , c , c.
type the word " define " and then the word you want to know .
so that 's because the camera needs time to calculate the focus and the exposure , but if you pre-focus with a half-press , leave your finger down , no shutter lag !
and i want to start by telling you a story about that change in africa .
all the time when they talk about it you immediately think about africa .
we put together a program that would , one : get the state out of businesses it had nothing -- it had no business being in .
and nigeria , with the oil sector , had the reputation of being corrupt and not managing its own public finances well .
we have opportunities in housing and real estate .
this is better than the performance of many oecd countries .
mixing african materials , such as we have , with materials from elsewhere .
and that 's the reason why , for hundreds of years , muslims everywhere have named their children jihad , their daughters as much as their sons , in the same way that , say , christians name their daughters grace , and hindus , my people , name our daughters bhakti , which means , in sanskrit , spiritual worship .
the united states , at this point , was putting pressure on all its arab allies , including tunisia , to stamp out extremism in their societies , and this imam found himself suddenly in the crosshairs of the tunisian intelligence service .
in somalia , in mali , in nigeria , in iraq , in afghanistan , pakistan , there are groups that claim to be the inheritors of the legacy of osama bin laden .
when those mujahideen defeated the soviet union , we disengaged .
who killed osama bin laden ? the seal team six .
i live in new york now . just this week , posters have gone up in subway stations in new york that describe jihad as savage .
and the only ones that look interesting to me are the ones that look slightly mistaken , of course , or very , very surprising .
i sit up at night and i watch movies and i watch women in movies a lot .
the last card he pulled , which was representing my destiny was this guy on like a straw boater with a cane and you know , sort of spats and this , you know , a minstrel singer , right ?
so you 'll have to , like , go check it out and come see me or something .
again , i don 't know where inspiration comes from .
because it 's all of these things that i love all kind of in one place .
rod : you like it ? all right .
im : oh , it 's so fabulous !
it 's got a lot of different things on it .
sorry , what ?
you know that all of the cool people are -- they 're doing it .
and so now we 're going to think about architecture in a very different way , we 're going to think about it like this .
or the way we went to describe that later : manifest destiny .
this is just the outline of it , and you can see , does it look like a regular building ? no .
lest you think this is all fiction , lest you think this is all fantasy , or romance , these same architects were asked to produce something for the central courtyard of ps1 , which is a museum in brooklyn , new york , as part of their young architects summer series .
and they were able to do it . that was their design , using that same computer modeling system and only five or six really different kinds of parts , a couple of struts , like this , some exterior cladding material and a very simple framing system that was all manufactured off-site and delivered by truck .
it transforms through the magic of lighting .
so , the first thing that is prioritized is politics .
the politics become easier as the decade progresses if you 're building on a foundation of security and economic development -- the rebuilding of prosperity .
that 's one actor , the security council .
so those three actors .
so i 'm going to talk a little about each of them .
there isn 't any construction going on . and so the sector shrivels away .
it 's to split the functions of a monopoly line ministry up into three .
and so inadvertently we empower the people who are the problem .
and let me just read it , the important details here : " shorthand description , [ ' hardcore pornography ' ] ; and perhaps i could never succeed in intelligibly defining it .
or there may be another way of doing it , which is to think about the problem in terms of what -- if you associate with moral philosophers -- is called the teapot problem .
you 're not interested in the limits of these things .
and then there 's another kind of thing that you might study , and you study that hard .
so it is very , very simple once you learn how to read it .
and then back to simplicity again .
cheap , functional , reliable things unleash the creativity of people who then build stuff that you could not imagine .
so , let me close -- let me close with my two aphorisms .
how do i put that simply ? no .
that 's the equivalent of stopping 10 jumbo jets full of babies and children from crashing every single day .
why is it that mayank , this young boy that i met in india , isn 't washing his hands ?
the profit motive is transforming health outcomes in this world .
i come from mali , one of the world 's poorest countries .
i hope you will join us and make handwashing part of your daily lives and our daily lives and help more children like myo reach their fifth birthday .
you want to measure it by diversity ?
and we 're coming over a cliff , and at the top of that cliff , dinosaurs had basically taken over .
but one with an immense chalkboard in the middle , with lots of little areas of dinosaur rock if you could survive an expedition .
basically you 're talking about a country that , when we started working there , did not have container traffic .
it has no big claw on its hind foot . it doesn 't look like a velociraptor .
you have the back legs ? no , you have the front legs , my friend .
anyway , you find other things , too .
and you take those four instances and you realize you have a complex problem .
i found myself in art .
what about all the kids like me that were in school -- kids like some of you out there -- that were in school and didn 't get a chance and will never get a chance to participate in science and technology ?
you have to have those steps . if you have -- it 's easy to get kids interested in science .
now you may have noticed there 's a new sector emerging called swap-trading .
now before i dig into the different systems of collaborative consumption , i 'd like to try and answer the question that every author rightfully gets asked , which is , where did this idea come from ?
thomas friedman is one of my favorite new york times columnists , and he poignantly commented that 2008 is when we hit a wall , when mother nature and the market both said , " no more . "
one of my favorite examples of collaborative lifestyles is called landshare .
in 2009 , zipcar took 250 participants from across 13 cities -- and they 're all self-confessed car addicts and car-sharing rookies -- and got them to surrender their keys for a month .
we 've gone from traditional car-ownership to car-sharing companies , such as zipcar and goget , to ride-sharing platforms that match rides to the newest entry , which is peer-to-peer car rental , where you can actually make money out of renting that car that sits idle for 23 hours a day to your neighbor .
masculinity mimicked by men who grew up with no fathers , camouflage worn by bullies who are dangerously armed but need hugs .
so , how do you do that ?
so what actually works ?
so , here you go .
if they follow protocol , they 'll pick up the phone and say , " hey , do you have the original ? "
i would move heaven and earth in order to get treatment for darius , and for me to be told that there might be other dariuses who are not getting treatment , that 's just viscerally wrong .
so , after that screening , we bring the children to the hospital .
so , we were fairly convinced -- we are convinced -- that recovery is feasible , despite extended visual deprivation .
so the world is this complex patchwork of regions .
patient : a square and a circle .
their acuity -- our acuity is 20 / 20 ; babies ' acuity is like 20 / 800 , so they are looking at the world in a very , very blurry fashion .
so we are pursuing this line of work and hopefully we 'll have more results to report soon .
this takes energy , producing clean water .
why are we having so much trouble dealing with these problems ?
and many of us here are deeply involved in that .
why is that ?
the question then is , how do we tap into this ?
the conventional wisdom has been that business actually makes a profit by causing a social problem .
it doesn 't waste resources .
that 's shared value .
how many of you are completely comfortable with calling yourselves a leader ?
and all of a sudden , you got to me , and you just stopped , and you stared . it was creepy . "
you have made someone 's life better by something that you said or that you did , and if you think you haven 't , think about all the hands that didn 't go back up when i asked that question .
most of the catadores work independently , picking waste from the streets and selling to junk yards at very low prices .
then , finally , painted by a street artist and become part of part of this huge , amazing mobile art exhibition .
geek . fatty . slut . fag .
and i wasn 't the only one .
from age 15 to 18 , i hated myself for becoming the thing that i loathed : a bully .
as far as i was concerned , life was pretty good .
he was three when he became a mixed drink of one part left alone and two parts tragedy , started therapy in eighth grade , had a personality made up of tests and pills , lived like the uphills were mountains and the downhills were cliffs , four fifths suicidal , a tidal wave of antidepressants , and an adolescence being called " popper , " one part because of the pills , 99 parts because of the cruelty .
why else would we still be here ?
i mean , they complain about it all the time .
the high-fear group , they laid it on really thick .
it was a notion that really came out of albert bandura 's work , who studied whether people could get a sense of empowerment .
and that doesn 't just work for me in terms of abstract numbers -- this overload of health information that we 're inundated with .
they reduce speeds by about five to 10 percent .
there is no good faith in this .
they 're packed with information .
we tell you that you 're okay , you 're normal .
it 's used to test for prostate cancer , but there are all sorts of reasons why your prostate might be enlarged .
anybody can create their feedback loop by asking these simple questions : can i have my results ?
and so , how i see my work contributing is sort of trying to literally re-imagine these connections and physically rebuild them .
now the gowanus is particularly smelly -- i will admit it .
so again , we got the short end of the deal there .
it also creates this incredibly interesting , i think , new amphibious public space , where you can imagine working , you can imagine recreating in a new way .
but we imagine , with our calculations , that by 2050 , you might be able to sink your teeth into a gowanus oyster .
and the people thought , " you know , you 're right .
and then , finally talk a little bit about a third way , about another technology , which is probably better than anything we have , but which -- there hasn 't been any enthusiasm for adoption precisely because people are so enamored with the current car seat solution . ok .
and it 's not just overall . it 's very robust to anything you want to look at .
now , eventually , one did . under the conditions of anonymity , they said they would be happy to do this test for us -- so anonymity , and 1,500 dollars per seat that we crashed .
the federal standards are that you have to score below a 1,000 to be an approved car seat on this crash , in some metric of units which are not important .
and so i think the answer to this puzzle is that there 's a much better solution out there , that 's gotten nobody excited because everyone is so delighted with the way car seats are presumably working .
and the jar of pills he had , he said , were the tiniest little pills he could find , so small you could barely see them .
bottom right are the sex chromosomes .
so the price of a base , to sequence a base , has fallen 100 million times .
so first , the way in which this woman was treated , in as little as 10 years , will look like bloodletting .
the year after it 's $ 100 , give or take a year .
this is a typewriter , a staple of every desktop for decades .
do you really want to elect a president whose genome suggests cardiomyopathy ?
how many fathers in the room ? raise your hands .
i don 't think these doctrines are right .
when we think about how we 're going to make the world a better place , we think education ; that 's where we put a lot of money .
they don 't think we are in an urgent need of assistance .
well a sermon wants to change your life and a lecture wants to give you a bit of information .
all the major religions give us calendars .
the other thing that religions are really aware of is : speak well -- i 'm not doing a very good job of this here -- but oratory , oratory is absolutely key to religions .
you immerse yourself in the water , and a physical action backs up a philosophical idea .
firstly , it 's trying to remind you of what there is to love .
they 're poets , they 're philosophers , they 're photographers , they 're filmmakers .
books alone , books written by lone individuals , are not going to change anything .
incoming missiles from north oxford at any moment .
it seems to me that there 's plenty of people in the ted community who are atheists .
i 'm a gamer , so i like to have goals .
i don 't want gamers to regret the time they spent playing , time that i encouraged them to spend .
i wish i 'd let myself be happier .
in other words -- and i think you see where this is going -- no reason to live .
that lasted for more than a year , and it was the hardest year of my life by far .
instead , we can use it as a springboard to unleash our best qualities and lead happier lives .
this is where you earn those seven and a half minutes of bonus life that i promised you earlier .
it gets stronger the more you exercise it .
looking good , looking good .
how are you going to spend these seven and a half minutes of bonus life ?
and the design problems of a project like that are just absolutely delicious .
so the obvious answer was , we need a mountain .
we 're in pole canyon , looking west up the western escarpment of mount washington , which is 11,600 feet on top .
number five of the seven is the payoff . this is it . the climax .
people think they 're just the size of shrubs , but that 's not actually true .
it 's called the pole adit . and it does have tungsten , a little bit of tungsten , left over , that 's the kind of mine it was .
let 's go to weather . mountains specialize in interesting weather .
another possible approach is right up the western front of the mountain .
first ascent of the western face to mount washington , and a solo ascent at that .
that 's a different place to be . it 's 11,400 feet and it 's exquisite .
one of the ranches is called the kirkeby ranch , and i 'll take you there for a minute .
all we have to do is highlight its spectacular features and blend in with them .
luckily , all of this changed a couple of centuries later .
he got traded a couple of times , he ended up in the minors for most of his career , and he actually ended up in management . he ended up as a general manager of the oakland a 's .
we 've medicalized everything in this country .
you are a pre-vivor .
and that 's actually true .
and then , turning round to the other side of the equation , i have personally supervised the investment of tens of millions of dollars into companies who have been pitching me with powerpoint presentations .
and what 's the second most important thing after integrity ?
so i don 't want somebody who 's saying , " hey , i 've got a great idea in a business i know nothing about .
there 's never been an angel- or a venture-funded company where bad things didn 't happen .
it starts off , you walk in the door .
you stop , you 've got to figure it out .
odds are i probably know somebody who has made a widget .
yes ? ok , steve jobs .
and you 're focused on me and why i 'm such a great guy , and why you want to invest in me .
it 's helpful that you 've had experience and you 've done this kind of thing before .
even if the competition is the old way of doing something .
you 're looking for 5 million -- at what kind of valuation ?
you 've noticed here that i 'm not looking at the screen , right ?
because i 'm using remote control over here .
but a lot of people don 't love it so much .
this is something that clearly separates us from the animal kingdom .
okay , here we go .
now this time on tv you have " bonanza , " don 't forget , you have " gunsmoke , " you have " andy griffith , " you have domestic shows all about comfort .
the 70s means who ? norman lear .
well , as we say in the business , x marks the spot .
so as dramatically different as these television shows , pure entertainment , have been over the last 50 years -- what did i start with ? -- one basic instinct remains .
there 's a new place in new york where the crowds are thickest -- ground zero .
in the face of america 's worst destruction people are building again .
dr : well what i was aware of was , there was this overwhelming need to act now .
shocking .
they were looking for a solution to deal with 30 or 40 thousand people a day who were going down there , that had nowhere to go .
so this developer said , " you know what , we 'll underwrite the entire expense . "
dr : no . in fact i told the contractor to go ahead .
you know , a couple of years this thing isn 't going to be here .
the protetch gallery recently had a show on ideas for buildings , which had some sort of inventive ideas of buildings .
this small foundation we put together is looking for other ways to help .
dr : it was an honor to do .
sincerely , mister michael bangoora . "
but they said , " no , but don 't show anyone , " but they slipped up .
it 's like a microscope to the rest of the world .
i 'd -- just one last thing i 'd like to say , i 'd , really -- like to thank all of you for being here .
do you have a preference ? good choice .
you can draw your simple stick figure , and then it collaborates with you to create , sort of , like , a post-war german etching .
democracy , as a type of politics , is a technology for the control and deployment of power .
now , i don 't want to leave a misimpression by identifying either of these propositions -- rather , either of these phenomena , democracy or islam -- as technologies .
and ostensibly , the same is true of democracy .
it may be that there was a great war to be fought between west and east , and it was necessary on the axis of democracy against communism .
now what would that look like ?
and i think that we are capable of taking on that obligation , but only if we put what we can into it .
i was devastated by this , and i never forgot the robot that he and i tried to build .
it 's the issue of epistemology , the study of how do we know that something is true . "
she said , when she was just about to walk on stage , the tele-directors were still trying to agree on what to do , and so she just walked on stage and did what felt most natural .
now , those are much better than what a novice like i could do , but they 're still jerky and imprecise .
i wish she could meet my dad .
so a few years ago , i actually started getting very interested in the seti program . and that 's the way i work .
i 'm going to skip ahead here . at some point we get larger , and we actually get to a macro-evolution scale .
i 'll inflate them kind of large .
so it 's acting with its two mouths there .
so , this is the planet that the player evolved on .
you can see the ocean levels are rising now and as they encroach upon the cities , i 'll start losing cities here .
now one of the tools i can eventually earn for my ufo is a monolith that i can drop down .
if we pull all the way back , we start seeing the entire galaxy here , kind of slowly in motion . and this is another thing where , typically when people present galaxies , it 's always been these very beautiful photos , but they 're always static . and when you actually bring it forward in time and start animating it , it 's actually kind of amazing , what a galaxy would look like , fast forwarded .
that is , if i value the escalope , the escalope , on the other hand , it doesn 't value me back .
on the free market of individual desires , i negotiate my value every day .
these teachers call themselves " pick-up artists . "
we are all useless .
we discussed , in the prior film , some of the old things that we did , like stents and insulin pumps for the diabetic .
and what we tried with the pig was external electrodes on the skin , like you see in an emergency room , and i 'm going to show you why they don 't work very well .
it 's about this big , the size of a pacemaker .
then , ventricular fibrillation , the heart quivers instead of beats -- this is just before death of the pig -- and then the pig died ; it went flat-line .
it 'll pick you up , and then we 're going to call your doctor , tell him about it .
and , by god , the neurologist did erase it , and that 's the middle picture : half of the aura erased by a short magnetic pulse .
our conclusions from our studies so far , at three research centers , is there is a marked improvement in pain levels after using it just once .
if that 's the source of the epilepsy , we can attack that as well .
but even if there is no signal , electro-stimulation of an appropriate part of the brain can turn off a brain disorder .
for example , i asked the epilepsy people what are they using for informed consent .
the public debate about architecture quite often just stays on contemplating the final result , the architectural object .
only the best ones can survive .
the swedish jury didn 't think so either . so we lost .
gradually , you get this idea that sustainable life is less fun than normal life .
we have a free system of bicycles called the city bike that you can borrow if you visit the city .
so when we actually won the competition we had to do an exhibition in china explaining the project .
until recently , this was the view from my apartment , onto this place where our client actually bought the neighbor site .
so , the mountain is like our first built example of what we like to refer to as architectural alchemy .
and what makes it interesting is that the island right now is just a piece of desert . it has no vegetation .
so you 're now about 14 billion years into this .
and we don 't appear until about 99.96 percent of the time into this story , just to put ourselves and our ancestors in perspective .
wouldn 't it be really odd if you went to africa and asia and antarctica and found exactly the same bird -- particularly given that we co-existed at the same time with at least eight other versions of humanoid at the same time on this planet ?
but the u.s. , the carnegie institute , stanford , american neurological association took this really far .
and as these technologies go forward , you keep seeing this , you keep seeing this , you keep seeing things -- 2000 , human genome sequence -- and it seems like nothing 's happening , until it does .
and you can map the exact pathways when a mouse sees , feels , touches , remembers , loves .
you 've also got people with who are extraordinarily smart , people who can remember everything they 've seen in their lives , people who 've got synesthesia , people who 've got schizophrenia .
what i think we are doing is we 're transitioning as a species .
how does it feel to be a person using a zipcar ?
so , people really respond very quickly to it , to prices .
the average american spends 19 percent of their income on their car , and there 's a pressure for them to reduce that cost , yet they have no outlet today .
so , i want to move now to the second part of my story , which is : when are we going to start doing this congestion pricing ? road pricing is coming .
volunteers flew in , added a whole bunch of devices , and for the next 12 months , mesh networks were the only wireless that was happening in new orleans .
and why is this going to happen ? because we 're going to do congestion pricing , we are going to do road tolls , gas taxes are going to become road pricing .
when i went this morning to larry brilliant 's tedtalk prize -- his fabulous networks -- imagine if there was an open-source mesh communications device that can be put into those networks , to make all that happen .
things that i want them to believe i understand .
maybe i should get away from this map completely , and really be honest about wanting to show you my favorite bits and pieces of rome and simply kick a soccer ball in the air -- which happens in so many of the squares in the city -- and let it bounce off of things . and i 'll simply explain what each of those things is that the soccer ball hits .
a spectacular framework , inside of which you see , usually , extraordinary blue sky .
he gets up , leaps onto his scooter , races through the city past the church of santa maria della pace , down the alleys , through the streets that tourists may be wandering through , disturbing the quiet backstreet life of rome at every turn .
he goes down to the basement and starts to check the wiring , and then gradually works his way up to the top of the building , apartment by apartment , checking every television , checking every connection , hoping to find out what this problem is .
i could peel out a page of this palazzo to show you what 's going on inside of it .
it 's a pigeon sitting on top of a church .
you can see the tombs and pines and so on and so forth along the way .
past the wonderful wall filled with the juxtaposition that i was talking about ; beautiful carvings set into the walls above the neon " ristorante " sign , and so on .
and i finished high school . and just walking , i found a man who gave me a full scholarship to the united states .
and it 's a really poor area . i represent northern kenya : the most nomadic , remote areas you can even find .
thank you very much .
the mall is the greatest civic stage in this country for dissent .
this is it . this is the hirshhorn -- so a 230-foot-diameter concrete doughnut designed in the early ' 70s by gordon bunshaft .
and the question is , if one inhabits that space , what is the material of the mall ?
it had to be approved by actually two agencies .
there are also some restrictions about how much it could be lit .
and i 'm just going to zip through these slides .
i 'm not going to tell you about exports and prices .
so we don 't have quite as good data , but you can see here the share of single men having pre-marital sex , or married men having extra-marital sex , and how that changes from the early ' 90s to late ' 90s , and late ' 90s to early 2000s . the epidemic is getting worse .
so malaria is a disease that kills you .
people aren 't changing their behavior enough to decrease the growth in the epidemic .
and i started thinking about how else might we figure out what the prevalence of hiv was in africa in the past .
if you think that 25 million people are infected , if you think that the unaids numbers are much too high , maybe that 's more like 10 or 15 million .
so the data that i have suggests that if you double export volume , it will lead to a quadrupling of new hiv infections .
but that 's enormously important for policy .
obviously , you see the resemblance .
but there is a happy ending to this story .
and he introduced me to the work of a man named terry laughlin who is the founder of total immersion swimming .
you can see this is the left extension .
so i thought why not punish myself ? i 'll do japanese .
the japanese classes were not japanese instruction classes , per se .
we can talk about that if anyone in interested .
and she pulled back , threw down her arms , put them on her hips , turned around and yelled across the room , " this guy is built like a god-damned mountain of muscle , and he 's grabbing me like a fucking frenchman , " which i found encouraging .
that photo is of the semi-finals of the buenos aires championships , four months later .
so using my arch-nemesis , spanish , no less , to learn tango .
i started reading popular science magazine , and i got really excited about the potential of solar energy to try and solve that crisis .
i began operating my business with 1-2-3 , began writing add-ins for 1-2-3 , wrote a natural language interface to 1-2-3 .
so i tried to figure out what other way could we try and make cost-effective solar electricity .
it 's this non-tracking collector with these six tuba-like horns , and each of them collect light in the following way -- if the sunlight strikes right here , it might bounce right to the center , the hot spot , directly , but if the sun is off-axis and comes from the side , it might hit two places and take two bounces .
but , his refinements were incredible .
so we tried to look at the stirling engine in a new way , because it was practical -- weight no longer mattered for our application the internal combustion engine took off because weight mattered because you were moving around .
that allows you to get the efficiency up from a hundredth of a percent to about two percent .
so it 's a complete reversible cycle , a very efficient cycle , and quite a simple thing to make .
the hot water 's optional .
but the hot sport right around las vegas and death valley and that area is very , very good .
so there 's basically 15 horses running at full speed just to keep the stage lit .
and so what i 'm going to do is , not so much give you the great hits of that program , as to give you this whole notion of how you encounter people in that kind of situation , what you try to find out about them , and when people deliver and when they don 't and why .
then there 's the celebrity interview , where it 's more important who 's asking the question than who answers .
but then i began to think of other things .
the worst interviews that you can ever have are with people who are modest .
she did so much . she was a playwright .
that 's the problem here , and she 's fighting me for that , and so then i asked her a question -- i didn 't know how i was going to get out of it -- i asked her a question about her days as a playwright , and again , characteristically , instead of saying , " oh yes , i was a playwright , and this is what blah blah blah , " she said , " oh , playwright . everybody knows i was a playwright .
the public self , the beauty , the intellect , and she walked around and talked to every person there and then went back into the room and was never seen again .
and i asked him one question .
" come to my apartment and we 'll talk for those 15 minutes , and then we 'll decide whether we proceed . "
first of all , was that dance , even though it hadn 't been offered to her , was her life .
fungible goods in economics can be extended and traded .
after von neumann , we have the pentium , where the billionth transistor is as reliable as the first one .
you know , hundreds of people came in begging , all my life i 've been waiting for this class ; i 'll do anything to do it .
ken olsen famously said , nobody needs a computer in the home .
-- her first night in the lab because she was going to make the sensor .
the projection of digital fabrication isn 't a projection for the future ; we are now in the pdp era .
the hardest thing at this point is the social engineering and the organizational engineering , but it 's here today .
i mean -- if i 'm a good darwinist , i 've got to believe there 's a reason for that .
this is not something i 've made up .
that 's why you don 't hear them talking about it . it 's yesterday 's question .
well i don 't think that .
but you can say that every animal that has become naked has been conditioned by water , in its own lifetime , or the lifetime of its ancestors . i think this is significant .
nothing to do with his teeth or his tongue or his lungs or anything like that -- purely has to do with its conscious control of its breath .
well i say , " why do you think it 's rubbish ? "
it was not the savanna , it was not the water , it was this ! "
the syllabus doesn 't mention even the fact that we 're naked , let alone look for a reason to it .
my best friend steve , sensing that something was terribly wrong , flew out to new haven to be with me .
instead , i 'm a chaired professor of law , psychology and psychiatry at the usc gould school of law , i have many close friends and i have a beloved husband , will , who 's here with us today .
but schizophrenia presents itself across a wide array of socioeconomic status , and there are people with the illness who are full-time professionals with major responsibilities .
my head was too full of noise , too full of orange trees and law memos i could not write and mass murders i knew i would be responsible for .
they strangle , they aspirate their vomit , they suffocate , they have a heart attack .
they 'd slice me up in thin slices or make me swallow hot coals .
the wall that kept me , elyn , professor saks , separate from that insane woman hospitalized years past , lay smashed and in ruins . "
portray them sympathetically , and portray them in all the richness and depth of their experience as people and not as diagnoses .
they spoke with a passion , an urgency , an intellectual conviction that , for me , was a voice i had not heard in decades , a dream long forgotten .
meanwhile , the values and voices of democracy are silent .
we may be at the top of the list when it comes to influencing access to personal wealth .
the value of the past also comes alive ; it provides a lot of company .
it undercuts self-righteousness , radically alters the tone and character of controversy , and enriches dramatically the possibilities for finding common ground .
that is where you come in .
he 's like , " yes , deborah ? "
zack bazzi : do i really want to go ? probably not .
sp : you don 't put 150,000 troops in there , and say we 're there to create democracy .
we were one of the lucky ones to get in the class with the sony cameras and the vista software .
the reason i quantify that is because we really embarked on this as a mutual journey to really get inside of it .
i 'll walk you through it .
21 : 00 hours , and it 's just our squad going through today 's events in our heads , whether we want to or not .
because the thing that very often is missing is , in the military what they call " hot wash . "
and i think it 's such an amazing gift that they would share this as a way of bridging .
and he looked at me , and i smiled , and then i saw the tears start welling up in his eyes .
do you , if you find out your neighbor 's been , do you spend some time ?
but mostly ...
this potential is not for the lucky few .
and there isn 't much we can do about that .
neil selinger , to me , is the embodiment of mounting the staircase in his third act .
it wasn 't your fault ; you 're just fine .
i mean , as girls , we start off feisty -- " yeah , who says ? "
sadly , the family of qalandars depended on this bear .
he has a telephone booth .
the big news that i want to announce today is that next month we will be bringing in the very last bear of india , into our rescue center .
so bumblebees are one of the few kinds of bees in the world that are able to hold onto the flower and vibrate it , and they do this by shaking their flight muscles at a frequency similar to the musical note c.
so bees have social healthcare .
and the reason is , after world war ii , we changed our farming practices .
how much is it going to take to contaminate humans ?
they 're providing the pollination insurance alongside our honeybees .
so let the small act of planting flowers and keeping them free of pesticides be the driver of large-scale change .
and then worked for the jerry brown administration .
i used to have a very romantic idea about villages , and it 's because i never lived in one .
famine mostly is a rural event now .
there 's all kinds of activity .
the numbers are considerable . a billion live in the squatter cities now .
from your standpoint this means a great increase in climate refugees over the coming decades , and what goes along with that , which is resource wars and chaos wars , as we 're seeing in darfur .
that 's where you see some of the source , not from my fellow environmentalists , but from people who feel threatened by nuclear power .
half of that is coming from dismantled warheads from russia , soon to be joined by our dismantled warheads .
but there 's this little problem with geoengineering : what body is going to decide who gets to engineer ? how much they do ? where they do it ?
i 'm the luckiest guy in the world .
this is just like a residency program , for those of you that are in medical school .
you 're a mother and you 're watching your child , and on day six , you see pustules that become hard .
in 1974 , india had a population of 600 million .
150,000 people from all over the world , doctors of every race , religion , culture and nation , who fought side by side , brothers and sisters , with each other , not against each other , in a common cause to make the world better .
instead of finding out what we thought was the case -- that blindness was caused mostly by glaucoma and trachoma -- we were astounded to find out that blindness was caused instead by cataract .
and they thought that if there was a pandemic , a billion people would get sick .
and it didn 't occur because gphin found the pandemic-to-be of sars three months before who actually announced it , and because of that we were able to stop the sars pandemic .
let 's increase the websites that they crawl from 20,000 to 20 million .
now , what 's really important is that , before there was gphin , 100 percent of all the world 's reports of bad things -- whether you 're talking about famine or you 're talking about bird flu or you 're talking about ebola -- 100 percent of all those reports came from nations .
cognitive psychologists now tell us that the brain doesn 't actually see the world as it is , but instead , creates a series of mental models through a collection of " ah-ha moments , " or moments of discovery , through various processes .
and it 's the part that feels .
and the third is to augment memory by creating a visual persistence .
secondly , making them interactive .
we hoisted them on poles to photograph .
so we had to create one .
its shape was too complex now .
when i bachelored , majoring in zoology in tel aviv university , i kind of fell in love with bugs .
what damage [ does ] it actually inflict on the plant ?
females giving rise to females giving rise to other females .
but this is the end result .
and if we spread those minute pirate bugs , the good ones , for example , in a sweet pepper plot , they go to the flowers .
i have one gram of those predatory mites .
it 's the same , and it can happen very quickly .
and this gap really narrows .
some have 5,000 . many have more .
the san francisco harbor was clogged with 600 ships at the peak because the ships would get there and the crews would abandon to go search for gold .
i 'll just play one of these and you 'll remember it .
but electricity is also very , very broad , so you have to sort of narrow it down .
so the light bulb laid down the heavy infrastructure , and then home appliances started coming into being .
i want to point out one thing . this is -- you guys know what this is .
i mean , you didn 't want this thing clogging up a light socket .
try to get dsl installed in your house .
this was the advertisement that they ran in 1917 .
i grew up in a tofu factory in seattle .
so , when i got to mit , you know , as most of you who are creatives , your parents all told you not to be creative , right ?
so , i was published , you know , so , wow , my design 's in a book , you know ?
and he says , well , when 's it going to stop ?
so , this happened in 1993 .
and chanel . so , getting to do different projects .
so , if you can see here , you know , that program you 're seeing in the corner , if you spread it out , it 's all these things all at once .
i made this series of works .
no , they 're all out there .
my alma mater , mit , and i had this moment -- a kind of m. night shayamalan moment -- where i thought , whoa ! i have to do this .
it 's a strange exuberance about materials , about the world : a fascination that i think the world needs quite very much right now .
coral reefs are growing slower in some places because of this problem .
if you go to the places where it 's just arriving , like the eastern part of the gulf , in alabama , there 's still people using the beach while there are people cleaning up the beach .
some people say there are not oil plumes .
a writer named ted williams called me , and he was asking me a couple of questions about what i saw , because he 's writing an article for audubon magazine .
when it comes time to spawn , they come inside , and these two tuna that were tagged , you can see them on the spawning grounds very much right in the area of the slick .
the economic effects go at least nationally in many ways .
it 's just ridiculous .
and you have to really wonder who are the laws made for , and who has gotten above the laws .
now there 's a mood to put some of that stuff back in place , but the lobbyists are already there trying to weaken the regulations after the legislation has just passed .
i work with children with autism .
let me explain this in a little more detail .
instead of arranging words in an order , in sequence , as a sentence , you arrange them in this map , where they 're all linked together not by placing them one after the other but in questions , in question-answer pairs .
now this happened in the past , so i 'm going to make that " told . "
and then i noticed something very interesting about freespeech .
and this , this has a lot of potential , a lot of promise , and the government of india recently licensed this technology from us , and they 're going to try it out with millions of different children trying to teach them english .
the data structure of thought .
there 's a song about india , and there 's a description of the country as , it says , .
i think i 've always been that way .
speak now , and i will answer ; how shall i help you , say ; ere to the wind 's twelve quarters i take my endless way . "
oleander is poisonous .
this sun is not afraid to show his face .
thanks .
she said , " life 's too short , i just can 't keep going with this . "
what 's happened here , again , almost without our knowing , is our culture has changed .
well , the healthcare system has been transformed : a culture pervaded with defensiveness , universal distrust of the system of justice , universal practice of defensive medicine .
they 're threatened with a legal claim .
five-inch fishing lure , it 's a big fishing lure , with a three pronged hook in the back , and outside it said , " harmful if swallowed . "
edison stated it best . he said , " hell , we ain 't got no rules around here , we 're trying to accomplish something . "
and so here is the fourth proposition .
the problem is , we created a system where we eliminated the right to have good values .
and we should bear in mind here that these projections were drawn up before the western financial crisis .
now i want to offer you three building blocks for trying to understand what china is like , just as a beginning .
you know , 2,000 years ago , europe : breakdown -- the fragmentation of the holy roman empire .
so actually the response of china to the question of hong kong -- as it will be to the question of taiwan -- was a natural response : one civilization , many systems .
and the reason for this is because -- well , there are two reasons , i think .
targets for the economy and so on are set by the state .
because , at the end of the day , it could , if necessary by force , get its own way .
some people -- i 've got an english friend in china , and he said , " the continent is sleepwalking into oblivion . "
but i want to argue , above all , a big-picture positive for this world .
japanese-americans , american citizens of japanese ancestry , were looked on with suspicion and fear and with outright hatred simply because we happened to look like the people that bombed pearl harbor .
i was a child , too young to understand the circumstances of my being there .
all men are created equal , we have an inalienable right to life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness , and i couldn 't quite make that fit with what i knew to be my childhood imprisonment .
they fought with amazing , incredible courage and valor .
they expanded what it means to be an american , including japanese-americans that were feared and suspected and hated .
so that is a pitiable state of affairs .
we feel that the poor have been humiliated for centuries .
this is how an elevated water reservoir is constructed .
thank you . thank you very much .
so despite all sorts of experts like me flying around the planet and burning jet fuel , and politicians signing treaties -- in fact , you could argue the net effect of all this has been negative , because it 's just consumed a lot of jet fuel .
and there 's no adaption .
but if you do this , it 's quick .
so i should say , i guess , that since the time of that original president johnson report , and the various reports of the u.s. national academy -- 1977 , 1982 , 1990 -- people always talked about this idea .
but let 's say you have sunlight hitting some particle and it 's unevenly heated .
one knob is the knob for controlling global temperature .
i guess the thing i haven 't said about this is , it is absurdly cheap .
that 's an absolutely possible scenario .
another thing is , maybe we need a treaty .
do you know of any painting that didn 't have a painter ? yes / no .
and it 's a good thing that there isn 't , because if there were , then mother nature would have a problem : how on earth do you get chimps to mate ?
so nature works on many levels here .
it was actually a terrible disaster for princeton .
the asteroids are a substantial amount of real estate , but not very large . and it 's not very promising for life , since most of it consists of rock and metal , mostly rock .
staying in the ocean and evolving in the ocean for 2 billion years , finally came out onto the land . and then of course it had great -- much greater freedom , and a much greater variety of creatures developed on the land than had ever been possible in the ocean .
they said , " it 's all right , you can detect radio waves from the sun , but the sun is the only object in the universe that 's close enough and bright enough actually to be detectable . you can easily calculate that radio waves from the sun are fairly faint , and everything else in the universe is millions of times further away , so it certainly will not be detectable .
so these creatures will be bright against the cold surroundings .
if we don 't find them , then we can create them ourselves .
but , critical poverty : this slide is from a presentation i gave not that long ago . gapminder.org tells the story of the gap between africa and the rest of the world in terms of health care .
that 's sterilizing equipment in nigeria .
there we go -- we 're going on a mission .
he had to get on the phone . this guy was always on the phone .
here is our very first patient , out of intensive care , and just watch that chair , all right ?
decide which instruments , stock it up with consumables .
what worries me is when politicians with money and charismatic rock stars use the words , it all just sounds so , so simple .
first step , the medical doctor went away for about six months , and he worked on what were to become these nine health goals , what were we aiming at .
i want you to select one of them and note the position of that house and keep that in your head .
what you see on the screen -- 35 percent of those not-so-famous houses lived in by 50,000 indigenous people , 35 percent had a working shower .
why do we have to do this work ?
okay , what do we do ?
the dung beetles ate the camel dung , the flies died through lack of food , and trachoma dropped .
solution : take human waste , take animal waste , put it into a chamber , out of that extract biogas , methane gas .
the common link between all the work we 've had to do is one thing , and that 's poverty .
and wherever they went , they killed .
our new french ceo believed in the power of positive pr ...
so everywhere we went , we auditioned amateurs .
enough .
sometimes i tell people i have triplets .
why have our breast cancer charities not come close to finding a cure for breast cancer , or our homeless charities not come close to ending homelessness in any major city ?
it 's cheaper for that person to donate 100,000 dollars every year to the hunger charity , save 50,000 dollars on their taxes , so still be roughly 270,000 dollars a year ahead of the game , now be called a philanthropist because they donated 100,000 dollars to charity , probably sit on the board of the hunger charity , indeed , probably supervise the poor sob who decided to become the ceo of the hunger charity , and have a lifetime of this kind of power and influence and popular praise still ahead of them .
but you do a little $ 1 million community fundraiser for the poor , and it doesn 't produce a 75 percent profit to the cause in the first 12 months , and your character is called into question .
they were pious people but they were also really aggressive capitalists , and they were accused of extreme forms of profit-making tendencies compared to the other colonists .
i 'll give you two examples . we launched the aidsrides with an initial investment of 50,000 dollars in risk capital .
i said that charitable giving is two percent of gdp in the united states .
and i called it the zimbabwe institute of vigital arts .
king ibrahim njoya of the bamum kingdom of cameroon developed shü-mom at the age of 25 .
so , that 's what i 've done with my life .
it was gone . they took my pro model off the shelf , which was essentially pronouncing you dead publicly .
because that had not yet been done . and then it dawned on me , and here 's part of what i 'm saying .
and indeed i did . it was the very first thing i filmed , which was awesome .
as you adjust , you punch it up , and then when i would do that , it was throwing my shoulder this way , which as i was doing it , i was like , " oh wow , that 's begging for a 360 flip , " because that 's how you load up for a 360 flip .
more safe , more secure . you can be an ios hacker , make your iphone do stuff it wasn 't supposed to .
and it gives you that clarity of perspective of , man , i 'm just me , and popularity , what does that really mean again ? not much .
kh : right . thank you . good job . rm : thank you . thank you .
i was interested in what was going on in the bag , the bag on the toy store shelf where those shrimp sat in suspended animation indefinitely .
so , in this room , there 's 20 percent oxygen or so , and if we reduce the oxygen concentration , we will all be dead .
i should mention briefly here that physiology textbooks that you can read about will tell you that this is a kind of heretical thing to suggest .
so , i thought , " wow , i have to get some of this . "
now , this was cosmic .
and i should say that the concentrations of hydrogen sulfide required to get this benefit are low , incredibly low .
thank you very much .
we subscribed to a lot of magazines , did our homework , but really everywhere you look around , we were surrounded by images like this .
the nurse was coming at me with this beautiful , beautiful child , and i remember , as she was approaching me , the voices of friends saying , " the moment they put the baby in your hands , you will feel a sense of love that will come over you that is [ on ] an order of magnitude more powerful than anything you 've ever experienced in your entire life . "
and i think i 'm speaking obviously here to the father 's experience .
that continued into the the hospital . it was really exhilarating .
and it was obviously a very difficult time -- really painful .
i 'll never forget , i remember vividly to this day , our first son , declan , was nine months old , and i was sitting there on the couch , and i was reading daniel gilbert 's wonderful book , " stumbling on happiness . "
you start to realize that " hey , i could go to this live music event and have an utterly transforming experience that will cover my entire body with goosebumps , but it 's more likely that i 'll feel claustrophobic and i won 't be able to get a beer .
it 's great that we have these transcendent moments of joy , but they 're sometimes pretty quick .
they rumble the belly and leave even photographers in awe watching the spectacle .
up , up , up .
so that 's sort of the part , and let me move on then and show you the hubble ultra deep field .
and the moon is only two seconds away , so if you take a picture of the moon using ordinary light , it 's the moon two seconds ago , and who cares .
it 's like you can 't see to the center of the sun ; you have to use other techniques to know what 's going on inside the sun .
so let me show you some of nature 's patterns that are the result of this .
now we 're going to fly through it at warp a million .
and then you put in some randomness , some fluctuations and some randomness , and realize a whole bunch of different representations .
this is a region which probably has more than 100,000 , on the order of a million galaxies in that region .
and we 're going to fly around , and we 'll fly around , and you 'll see occasionally a couple of filaments intersect , and you get a large cluster of galaxies .
so i 'm going to show you one that can be run on a desktop in two days in the next picture .
so this is what we started with 15 years ago , with the cosmic background explorer -- made the map on the upper right , which basically showed us that there were large-scale fluctuations , and actually fluctuations on several scales . you can kind of see that .
now , to make this more concrete , let 's look at the list of top 10 words that statistically stick out in the most favorite tedtalks and in the least favorite tedtalks .
it 's perfectly fine .
and i hope some of you will be inspired for next year to create this , which i really want to see .
on one of my first trips to india , i met this young woman , sevitha , who had just given birth to a tiny premature baby , rani .
we hope that the embrace infant warmer and other simple innovations like this represent a new trend for the future of technology : simple , localized , affordable solutions that have the potential to make huge social impact .
i want to go . i want to be a part of this . "
i recently realized that two-thirds of americans today had not been born at the time of 1963 .
robert meyerhoff said , " why is it that everything i see on tv about black boys , if it 's not about basketball , is not positive ?
and what is interesting about that is that so many students are smart and can do it .
secondly , it 's not about test scores only .
and so our students are working in labs regularly .
because so many students are bored in class .
choice , not chance , determines your destiny , dreams and values .
and said , " hi , i 'm trying to make a toaster .
but luckily , i found a patent online for industrial furnaces that use microwaves , and at 30 minutes at full power , and i was able to finish off the process .
and for a while that was looking really good .
i don 't know if you could see , but i was never able to make insulation for the wires .
people normally write that down , by the way .
cybercriminals now have crime packs with business intelligence reporting dashboards to manage the distribution of their malicious code .
so let 's have a look here on my victim computer .
it 's code which will be interpreted on the webpage .
down below , highlighted in red , in the other section of source code , is this bit " leded : leded . "
but this is where our investigation starts to slow down .
my home network , prettyflyforawifi , which i think is a great name .
we also need to think very carefully about how we develop our future talent pool .
this song kind of came out of all of that .
so this edge is the same that has been defined by scientists as the planetary boundaries .
so one of the main challenges of our times is to reconcile three time scales : the short term of the economy , the ups and downs of the stock market , the end-of-the-year accounts ; the midterm of the quality of life -- what is the quality every moment of our life , over 10 years and 20 years ? -- and the long term of the environment .
he 's one of my friends in tibet .
so we tested all that , and in the end , he said , clearly people can be altruistic .
there are people who had choice , like pastor andré trocmé and his wife , and the whole village of le chambon-sur-lignon in france .
they have not been trained .
fortunately , there is the evolution of culture .
the homo economicus cannot deal with poverty in the midst of plenty , cannot deal with the problem of the common goods of the atmosphere , of the oceans .
but today i want to focus on this concept of composition for physical space .
in this case , the app is the work itself , and the architecture of the landscape is intrinsic to the listening experience .
gamma is just one of these companies .
as i said , it 's a $ 5 billion industry .
i can 't tell you for sure that hacking team has sold their technology in the united states , but what i can tell you that if they haven 't sold it , it isn 't because they haven 't been trying hard .
thank you very much .
i did what people from my kind of background were supposed to do .
but what can you do ? you 're in the middle of the ocean .
a few freeze-dried meals , but mostly i try and eat much more unprocessed foods .
well , i thought the atlantic was big , but the pacific is really , really big .
it was one of the worst feelings of my life , as i was lifted up on that winch line into the helicopter and looked down at my trusty little boat rolling around in the 20 foot waves and wondering if i would ever see her again .
i was doing a pathetically slow speed of about 1.3 knots , and they were doing only marginally less pathetic speed of about 1.4 : it was like two snails in a mating dance .
if the atlantic was about my inner journey , discovering my own capabilities , maybe the pacific has been about my outer journey , figuring out how i can use my interesting career choice to be of service to the world , and to take some of those things that i 've learned out there and apply them to the situation that humankind now finds itself in .
maybe if we all start doing this , we can make it socially unacceptable to say yes to plastic in the checkout line .
thank you .
mt : and when they worked in the vivid playground of his imagination , he would build them in his workshop .
nt : yes , that was a big mistake .
and i 'm honored to meet you , the future leaders of great britain and this world .
i was also fortunate enough to be cherished and encouraged by some strong male role models as well , including my father , my brother , uncles and grandfathers .
and he urged the people in that meeting , in that community , to devote themselves to closing the gap between those two ideas , to work together to try to make the world as it is and the world as it should be , one and the same .
please remember that .
in the white house , there 's the desk that he sits at -- it 's called the resolute desk .
the 0.1 percent in the u.s.
one set of causes is political : lower taxes , deregulation , particularly of financial services , privatization , weaker legal protections for trade unions , all of these have contributed to more and more income going to the very , very top .
we have superstar technologists .
these are among the world 's most admired , most beloved , most innovative companies .
the same is true of globalization .
today , we are living through an era of economic transformation comparable in its scale and its scope to the industrial revolution .
the late geoffrey dickens , m.p. was attending a fete in his constituency .
consciousness . i see all your faces .
this is extraordinary . because rice -- get this -- rice is known to have 38 thousand genes .
taste buds , every 10 days or so .
they don 't . nobody knows what it is .
" why are we here ? " and " what should we do about it while we are ?
and we discovered that it 's a very good thing that , when you go home with something that 's been broken , you 've actually learned a lot more than when you managed to tick off all of your test objectives the first time through .
now let 's see it in action .
when we do have to do something truly out-of-the-box , we use an incremental design , build , test , redesign cycle that lets us reduce risk in baby steps .
the transition simultaneously expands our horizons while making the world a smaller , more accessible place .
every culture is trying to understand itself : " why do we exist ? "
and alexander said , " i am conquering the world . "
but these are not the stories that the gymnosophist heard .
you go again and again and again .
so , no matter what he did , it was always zero .
it 's always about my taste .
i wanted to learn mythology . but there is nowhere you can study .
so , he had asked me to be the chief belief officer , and said , " all i want to do is align belief . "
after a leader completes his training and is about to take over the store , we blindfold him , we surround him with the stakeholders , the customer , his family , his team , his boss .
varuna has but a thousand eyes .
they would usually come to a good conclusion what would be a perfect car .
then she said , " for weeks i was researching which hotel to stay for this one night .
we know about our brains more than before .
quite often here they still identify with a certain kind of a lottery mentality .
we spend so much time choosing things for ourselves and barely reflect on communal choices we can make .
then , with industrialization , everything started to become centralized .
cities are places of celebration , personal expression .
and then you look at cities that evolved after the automobile , and it 's not that kind of a pattern .
they 're still not to where copenhagen is , where something like 42 percent of the trips within the city are by bicycle . it 's mostly just because they have fantastic infrastructure there .
so he 's developing strategies so the vehicle can communicate with pedestrians , so -- so the headlights are eyeballs , the pupils can dilate , we have directional audio , we can throw sound directly at people .
you know , standardized platform with the motors and the battery when it operates , little solenoids that will lock it in place and get low-voltage power .
this can be combined with led lighting as well .
so why is that ?
so what do you do ?
for 10 dollars , you can manufacture and ship an insecticide treated bed net and you can teach someone to use them .
it 's not the middle ages anymore , it 's the 21st century .
you have to walk a few kilometers to get your kids immunized .
that 's full immunization .
and many experiments have been run , and they all have the same results , so i 'm just going to talk to you about one .
they need to know : out of all the things i could do , what is the best way to achieve my goals ?
things that don 't work so well is bribing parents , just because so many kids are already going to school that you end up spending a lot of money .
and the problem of poverty is not like that .
it 's not going to be easy .
a post that read : " goodbye . "
even the printing press , even the printing press was assumed to be a tool that was going to enforce catholic intellectual hegemony across europe .
well , predictions of world peace ? check .
but there was one programmer who decided that this wasn 't the way to work .
this long string of numbers and letters here is a unique identifier tied to every single change , but without any central coordination .
so , the law is also dependency-related .
this , graphically , was the answer .
thank you for listening .
the project began in ' 57 at general atomics there .
the people who supported it were the air force , which meant that it was all secret .
so , thanks to him .
look at the little guys there outside the vehicle .
in tedistan , there are no borders , just connected spaces and unconnected spaces .
the end of the cold war and the disintegration of the soviet union .
china isn 't conquering mongolia .
because globalization opens up all kinds of ways for us to undermine and change the way we think about political geography .
china has signed military agreements with many countries in the region .
six years after the u.s. invasion of iraq , the country still exists more on a map than it does in reality .
palestine is something of a cartographic anomaly because it 's two parts palestinian , one part israel .
now i know some of you may be thinking , " oil , oil , oil .
the more pipelines we have , the more silk roads we 'll have , and the less of a dominant great game competition we 'll have in the 21st century .
so in other words , i believe that president sarkozy of france is right when he talks about a mediterranean union .
there is a great race on for energy resources under the arctic seabed .
and i didn 't understand why , in one hand they say , " speak the truth , " in the other hand , when you say the truth , they hated you .
so , why i 'm telling you this , you know , maybe , you know , whoever is sitting next to you can change your whole life -- it 's possible .
so i just thought , " i 'm going to capture thumbprint , footprint , or whatever traces we leave as humans . "
martin luther king would say , " i imagine a world where all cows will be free to cross the road , without having their motives called into question . "
so the lamp is not just giving a light , it 's also giving a darkness .
then i thought , " i will go to the small scale industries facilitating unit and ask help . "
and i was like , " what do you mean ? "
when it 's bounced on the moon , we see it .
this is called " gravity . "
there was this equation in my family that went something like this : if you are intelligent , you therefore are not spiritual .
she says , " excuse me , i 'm pissed off , and i know a few things , and we better get busy about them right now . "
and i realize we 're all busy people , so don 't worry , you can do this on a lunch break .
and what have you always wanted to ask someone from the other side ?
it 's two people dropping the pretense of being know-it-alls .
it is so powerful that we only need tiny amounts .
so we are faced with a paradox .
even if i could have afforded the phone bills home , like most people in the congo , my parents did not own a phone line .
redwood rainforest is incredibly difficult to move through , and even today , individual trees are being discovered that have never been seen before , including , in the summer of 2006 , hyperion , the world 's tallest tree .
steve sillett and marie antoine are the principal explorers of the redwood forest canopy . they 're world-class athletes , and they also are world-class forest ecology scientists .
all other primates , when they 're scared , they run up a tree , where they feel safe .
when you get near the top of the tree , you feel like you can 't fall -- in fact , it 's difficult to move .
i 've wanted to ask craig venter if it would be possible to insert a synthetic chromosome into a human so that we could reiterate ourselves if we wanted to .
this is an unnamed species of copepod . a copepod is a crustacean .
it 's absolutely heartbreaking to see .
it 's an amazing sense of wonder you 've given me , and a sense of just how fragile this whole thing is .
which is a great place to do it because nobody cares .
but if you want to be fully functional and fully human and fully humane , i think you need to learn to live , not without regret , but with it .
we have a vast body of literature on consumer and financial decisions and the regrets associated with them -- buyer 's remorse , basically .
when i went home that night after getting my tattoo , i basically stayed up all night .
it 's that i sat there and i thought , " make it go away . make it go away .
and the amazing thing about this really insidious technological innovation is that even just with this one thing , we can experience a huge range of regret .
all of us who 've experienced regret that contains real pain and real grief understand that humor and even black humor plays a crucial role in helping us survive .
and what i loved about this image of the compass was that i felt like it encapsulated both of these ideas in one simple image .
however , the approach i built here is actually high-resolution , low-cost , and probably most importantly , very scalable .
now , when you have initiatives like the $ 100 laptop , i kind of cringe at the idea that we 're going to introduce a whole new generation of people to computing with this standard mouse-and-windows-pointer interface .
we 're not really accessing it . and one of the reasons why i think that is , is because -- we 'll be helped by things like graphics and visualization and inference tools , but i also think a big part of it is going to be starting to be able to have better interfaces , to be able to drill down into this kind of data , while still thinking about the big picture here .
it was just released at siggraph last year , but it 's a great example of the kind of research i really love : all this compute power to apply to make things do the right things , intuitive things , to do exactly what you expect .
because the more we learned , the more concerned we grew .
when wal-mart declares it 's going to go green and be profitable , it has a powerful impact on other great institutions .
but as long as we pretend that co2 is free , as long as these uses are nearly invisible , how can we expect change ?
you know tom friedman says , " if you don 't go , you don 't know " ?
all for want of two dollars ' worth of medications that we can buy at the corner drugstore .
but i 'm really afraid we need much , much more .
when i was in davos , china 's mayor of dalian was pressed about their co2 strategy , and he said the following , " you know , americans use seven times the co2 per capita as chinese . "
i can 't wait to see what we tedsters do about this crisis .
forty-three .
so we find some investors , and they pay for a set of services , and if those services are successful , then they improve outcomes , and with those measured reductions in re-offending , government saves money , and with those savings , they can pay outcomes .
only 13 percent achieve a reasonable level of five gcses at 16 , against 58 percent of the wider population .
and we learn and adapt the program accordingly .
now , this was a month when north korea agreed to dismantle its nuclear facilities .
similarly , a study in e-content showed that much of global news from u.s. news creators is recycled stories from the ap wire services and reuters , and don 't put things into a context that people can understand their connection to it .
it took from the stone age to achieve that .
it will create huge opportunities in technology .
the most dramatic changes will be the skyscraper type of new pyramids that will take place in china and in many other countries .
that will be the challenge of the scholars , and of all of us engaged in thinking about the future .
and it looks like this right now .
they own half a billion people .
so the first one , it 's a very simple game dynamic .
so if they wanted the world to end , if they wanted productivity to stop , they could make this a 30-minute cycle , and no one could do anything else , right ?
so they whip it out . and you see men , they have that black card .
i am only 85 percent complete on linkedin , and that bothers me .
and communal discovery is powerful because it leverages the network that is society to solve problems .
we use game dynamics to build on it . we build with mindshare .
maybe we can just say , " no , it 's not possible . "
i 'm extrapolating .
if you divide this huge archive into smaller subsets where a smaller subset actually shares similar features , then there 's a chance of success .
" what are the chance of encountering pirates ? "
we see projects which are much beyond any single research team can do , and this is really new for the humanities , which very often take the habit of working in small groups or only with a couple of researchers .
but as we enter the era of big data , of network systems , of open platforms , and embedded technology , i 'd like to suggest it 's time to reevaluate an alternative vision that was actually developed around the same time .
a protease that had eluded determination for over 10 years was solved was by three players in a matter of days , perhaps the first major scientific advance to come from playing a video game .
every interaction we have in the world is recorded by an ever growing array of sensors : your phone , your credit card , your computer . the result is big data , and it actually presents us with an opportunity to more deeply understand the human condition .
that must be acknowledged , and they can 't be swept aside , even with the best of intents .
perhaps the adversary would disrupt their own network if they knew they cheating would-be jihadists .
and over the course of 15 minutes , we watched through hidden cameras what happened .
they wonder what that bowl of pretzels is doing there in the first place .
what we 've been finding across dozens of studies and thousands of participants across this country is that as a person 's levels of wealth increase , their feelings of compassion and empathy go down , and their feelings of entitlement , of deservingness , and their ideology of self-interest increases .
in one of these studies , we looked at whether drivers would stop for a pedestrian that we had posed waiting to cross at a crosswalk .
in fact , the top 20 percent of our population own close to 90 percent of the total wealth in this country .
and there 's the emergence of dozens of grassroots movements , like we are the one percent , the resource generation , or wealth for common good , in which the most privileged members of the population , members of the one percent and elsewhere , people who are wealthy , are using their own economic resources , adults and youth alike , that 's what 's most striking to me , leveraging their own privilege , their own economic resources , to combat inequality by advocating for social policies , changes in social values , and changes in people 's behavior , that work against their own economic interests but that may ultimately restore the american dream .
so erez and i followed the fate of over 100 irregular verbs through 12 centuries of english language , and we saw that there 's actually a very simple mathematical pattern that captures this complex historical change , namely , if a verb is 100 times more frequent than another , it regularizes 10 times slower .
and when the stuff of history is available in digital form , it makes it possible for a mathematical analysis to very quickly and very conveniently review trends in our history and our culture .
obviously this is not interesting at all in the sense of the narrative .
how do we know that being in a space makes a difference ?
the difference between thinking and doing .
and if you stop again , you wonder , " is that a one-hour valley ?
what does the word " public " mean today anyway ?
should it be a mastectomy ? should it be a lumpectomy ?
you are going to solve a series of puzzles , and i 'm going to show you examples of these puzzles momentarily .
we 'll give another five minutes for the ingredient to have its effects .
less effort , you 're less persistent , and so on .
volatile stock market , getting negative feedback that 's also immediate .
thank you .
this is a defibrillator , and this is a device that goes into a person to control their heart rhythm , and these have saved many lives .
now , they have two areas they can attack .
the results are astonishing , and when they gave this talk , even though they gave this talk at a conference to a bunch of computer security researchers , everybody was gasping .
this is what the phone looks like . it 's not really a phone .
that one 's pretty easy to fix .
if someone is able to put malware on your iphone , they could then maybe get the typing that you do whenever you put your iphone next to your keyboard .
okay , there 's a few heartbreaks that chocolate can 't fix .
thanks .
i tell people it involves creating poetry that doesn 't just want to sit on paper , that something about it demands it be heard out loud or witnessed in person .
step one was the moment i said , " i can . i can do this . "
and here 's what happens , and here 's what you would discover too if we all started sharing our lists out loud .
somebody once told me it 's like walking through life like this .
and that is step three : infusing the work you 're doing with the specific things that make you you , even while those things are always changing .
when my grandpa genji died , i was only five years old , but i took my mom by the hand and told her , " don 't worry , he 'll come back as a baby . "
and you , you get to share mine .
number one was asthma , number two was developmental delays , number three was 400-fold increases in rare childhood cancers in the last eight to 10 , 15 years .
and you can let them social network with your tadpole , because the environmental health clinic has a social networking site for , not only impatients , humans , but non-humans , social networking for humans and non-humans .
this was vodka and solution , gin and solution .
these are little opportunities to intercept those pollutants before they enter the harbor , and they 're produced by impatients on various city blocks in some very interesting ways .
so it 's on legs , so it focuses all the load on the masonry walls and the columns .
you know , coyote in central park , a whale in the gowanus canal , elk in westchester county .
healthy sub-populations of birds , increasing biodiversity generally .
in this case , instead of throwing chewing gum , or doritos or whatever you have in your pocket at the fish -- there 's a body of water in iceland that i 've been dealing with that 's in the middle of the city , and the largest pollution burden on it is not the roadborne pollution , it 's actually white bread from people feeding the fish and the birds .
and the way to it , for me , was through artistic means .
this was taken in the riviera sugar factory in red hook , brooklyn .
there 's nobody around you , and you hear the kids playing in the park above you , completely unaware of what 's underneath .
this children 's hospital was closed in 1997 ; it 's located in newark .
there are also phone cables that were used in the ' 50s and many bunkers from the world war ii era .
i 've been leaning towards more collaborative projects like these , lately .
we tried to answer this simple question : can you find a unifying language that cuts across age and income and culture that will help people themselves find a new way of living , see spaces around them differently , think about the resources they use differently , interact differently ?
people are ready and respond to the story of food .
we 've created a company . we are designing and building an aquaponics unit in some land that was spare at the back of the high school , like you do , and now we 're going to be growing fish and vegetables in an orchard with bees , and the kids are helping us build that , and the kids are on the board , and because the community was really keen on working with the high school , the high school is now teaching agriculture , and because it 's teaching agriculture , we started to think , how could we then get those kids that never had a qualification before in their lives but are really excited about growing , how can we give them some more experience ?
now , none of this is rocket science .
inspire local planners to put the food sites at the heart of the town and the city plan , not relegate them to the edges of the settlements that nobody can see .
the work involves hundreds of different crochet models .
i 've written books about the history of space , the history of physics and religion , and i write articles for people like the new york times and the l.a. times .
woolenness and wetness aren 't exactly two concepts that go together .
mathematicians like to characterize things by being formalist .
so we ask the question again , " how many straight lines can i draw through the point , but never meet the original line ? "
then our mathematicians come along and said , " there 's this thing called a sphere , and the lines come together at the north and south pole . "
their answer was interesting .
we live in a society that 's obsessed with presenting information in this way , teaching information in this way .
let me show you how it works .
the results of our work in the field are used to produce media and deliverables to be used by conservators and researchers .
luckily , in the last two or three decades , digital technologies have been developing that have helped us to develop tools that we 've brought to bear in the digital preservation , in our digital preservation war .
thank you .
optimism is sometimes characterized as a belief , an intellectual posture .
greenland remains . twenty-eight years ago , this is what the polar ice cap -- the north polar ice cap -- looked like at the end of the summer , at the fall equinox .
if it 's more being trapped on the way out , then you would expect it to be warmer here and cooler here . here is the lower atmosphere .
we have to have a unified view of how to go about this : the struggle against poverty in the world and the challenge of cutting wealthy country emissions , all has a single , very simple solution .
we can 't wait for the kind of drought australia had to change our political culture .
that hurts .
in terms of your own personal role going forward , al , is there something more than that you would like to be doing ?
i see you .
we tend to forget , though , the other audience that 's influenced by our nonverbals , and that 's ourselves .
and this is what happens when you put together high and low power . so what we tend to do when it comes to power is that we complement the other 's nonverbals .
so we know that our nonverbals govern how other people think and feel about us . there 's a lot of evidence .
so we know that in primate hierarchies , if an alpha needs to take over , if an individual needs to take over an alpha role sort of suddenly , within a few days , that individual 's testosterone has gone up significantly and his cortisol has dropped significantly .
here 's what we find on testosterone .
so we bring people into a lab , and they do either high- or low-power poses again , they go through a very stressful job interview .
i don 't want to get there and then still feel like a fraud .
you are going to fake it .
so this is two minutes .
so , we think a lot about what really makes science work ?
so that is both aristotelian cosmology , and in a certain sense , medieval society .
there 's only where it is relative to everything else that is .
so it works . but not only that , if you think about how natural selection works , then it turns out that natural selection would only make sense in such a relational universe .
and politics is , in the ideal sense , the way in which we continually address our network of relations in order to achieve a better life and a better society .
so that was a big wake-up call in the 1980 's .
we owe an incredible debt of gratitude to these two women .
it was a very big deal for her to become director .
ekg goes pbbrrhh , so the doctors can see this hugely abnormal ekg .
and you can see , it 's lumpy bumpy .
and that is microvascular obstruction .
that 's all stem cells .
so we 're 35 years behind .
as a magician , i try to create images that make people stop and think .
in 1987 i heard of a story about a boy that fell through ice and was trapped under a river .
but this is that attempt .
that was the one that i studied .
and you have these awful headaches .
i decided that i was going to break the world record live on prime-time television .
so , i would sleep in a hypoxic tent every night .
so , i did what any person seriously pursuing scientific advancement would do .
this time it started at 120 beats , and it never went down .
it was awful .
i had the world record and i wanted to make sure it was legitimate .
when i was born there was less than one billion children in the world , and today , 2000 , there 's almost two billion .
that 's where we find islamic majority .
i start the world , and here we go .
but there are also countries here like guatemala , like papua new guinea , like yemen and afghanistan .
you need to have access to some family planning .
i strongly recommend melinda gates ' last tedtalk .
so what will happen now is what we call " the big fill-up . "
i want to talk about 4.6 billion years of history in 18 minutes .
so , mars is a pretty big place even though it 's half the size .
we believe there 's some water in the polar caps , there are polar caps of north pole and south pole .
and this shows the percent . if it 's a blueish color , it means 16 percent by weight .
this is opportunity . this is spirit .
if any place in the world can build an airplane to fly on mars , it 's the langley research center , for almost 100 years a leading center of aeronautics in the world .
and we have it in something called an aeroshell .
we do our tests at 100,000 feet .
i have a big impact on the planet to travel here by plane .
it was impossible to do this picture 15 years ago .
every year we lose 50 thousand square miles in deforestation .
fifth ... from my childhood , fifth we were having fun , biking .
i still surf . i sail the world . i freedive .
and we humans have been walking upright for only 200 thousand years .
we haven 't yet understood that we 're going at a much faster pace than the planet can sustain .
and one of them wrote , " situation hopeless . stop .
you see , the first time , he was playing with an impulse on every note .
now , the other thing i wanted to do is to tell you about you .
amazing number of people think they 're tone-deaf .
when i started , you thought , " how beautiful that sounds . "
do you remember hamlet ? act one , scene three , he finds out that his uncle killed his father .
so this is a piece which goes from away to home .
and at the end , they went crazy , clapping . they were clapping .
if you thought , everybody loves classical music -- they just haven 't found out about it yet . "
and i say , it 's appropriate for us to ask the question , who are we being as we go back out into the world ?
because the small hadron collider once was the big thing .
we 'll grow by six cities of 12 million people a year for the next 30 years .
and there i met these two , azra on the left , maureen on the right .
ten years ago , they certainly would have been married .
many of them don 't have electricity at home .
so time and again , i found people like this .
that 's one city .
mckinsey came along and looked at his model and said , " you know what you should do with this , madhav ?
they often hit their target but miss the point .
so we certainly need more of that .
that is why we need really radical thinking , and why radical thinking is now more possible and more needed than ever in how we learn .
they can transform cities and communities .
back to back is an australian company of people with intellectual disabilities . i saw their amazing show in new york at the staten island ferry terminal at rush hour .
whole arm . shoulder disarticulation .
i put a team together , a little over 13 months ago , got up to 20 some-odd people .
it 's got 14 active degrees of freedom .
and another environmental challenge is resources , finding them and collecting them .
each symbol is a colony , and the size of the symbol is how many offspring it had , because we were able to use genetic variation to match up parent and offspring colonies , that is , to figure out which colonies were founded by a daughter queen produced by which parent colony .
whatever resource one species is using , another species is likely to be using that at the same time .
it can be done with cheap materials .
you know , " design -- bad design , there 's just no excuse for it .
it 's where we all belong . "
and for decades , i 'm going , why does this happen ? what can i do about it ? how can i change this ? i mean there must be something .
what 's the difference here , the wheelchair with no lights and the wheelchair with lights ?
as an intentional murderer , anders breivik is merely evil .
" no need for birth control , doc , are you sure about that ? "
but i never became a designer . no , no , no , no . never attempted . never even close .
today we don 't confront the chaos of nature .
and all of a sudden , from around a corner , comes this young man , paralyzed , just like me , in this metal and wood and leather pedal , three-wheel tricycle-wheelchair device , and he pedals up to me as fast as he can .
and i have to say that on that score , i have a very unfair advantage over all of you .
saparmurat niyazov , he was one of them .
well , at 22 , i was very lucky .
a bank in paris held accounts of companies controlled by him , one of which was used to buy the art , and american banks , well , they funneled 73 million dollars into the states , some of which was used to buy that california mansion .
and then there 's the problem of anonymous shell companies .
in 2011 , natural resource exports outweighed aid flows by almost 19 to one in africa , asia and latin america . nineteen to one .
in 1999 , when global witness called for oil companies to make payments on deals transparent , well , some people laughed at the extreme naiveté of that small idea .
now , usually if people are familiar with bioluminescence at all , it 's these guys ; it 's fireflies .
but you don 't always have to go down to the depths of the ocean to see a light show like this .
so , most animals make blue light , and most animals can only see blue light , but this fish is a really fascinating exception because it has two red light organs .
this little guy has no visible means of self-support .
for this fish , it 's actually whole cells with nuclei and membranes .
it 's not exactly rocket science . we call this thing eye-in-the-sea .
we 're at the edge of the brine pool , there 's a fish that 's swimming towards the camera .
but nobody was really worried about this .
now , how much computation does the brain do ?
if you just look at these two pictures , these kind of words pop into your mind .
now , this pore can open and close .
ok , so a computer picks a specific item of data from memory , it sends it into the processor or the alu , and then it puts the result back into memory .
and they figured out all the different cells , and they figured out the network , and we just took that network and we used it as the blueprint for the design of a silicon chip .
but the point that i want to make -- i 'll show you up here .
and i think a lot of people in africa have this different perspective , and i think that 's going to impact technology .
and jane goodall , making her own special connection , photographed by nick nichols .
now i have to tell you , i was talking to kyle last week about this , that i was going to tell this story .
there 's an infrared beam that 's going across , and he has stepped into the beam and taken his photograph .
this is actually one of the rangers .
we weren 't the only ones to tackle this subject , but the photographs that brian and randy created are among the best to capture both the human and natural devastation of overfishing .
and then back to the states to recuperate at veterans ' hospitals , such as here in walter reed .
this mouthing behavior , on the right , was really her way of saying to him , " hey , look how big i am ! "
as a result , we 're tuned in to the subtlest things that could possibly be wrong with a computer rendering , in order to believe whether these things are realistic .
so , here you can see her moving her eyes around , moving her mouth around .
so what you 're going to see now , after this , is a completely photo-real digital face .
someone who 's down or depressed , they 're under a cloud .
they 're like nature 's version of those inkblot images , you know , that shrinks used to show their patients in the ' 60s , and i think if you consider the shapes you see in the clouds , you 'll save money on psychoanalysis bills .
it 's composed entirely of ice crystals cascading from the upper reaches of the troposphere , and as these ice crystals fall , they pass through different layers with different winds and they speed up and slow down , giving the cloud these brush-stroked appearances , these brush-stroke forms known as fall streaks .
nothing is more nourishing , more stimulating to an active , inquiring mind than being surprised , being amazed . it 's why we 're all here at ted , right ?
it 's pointless . it 's a pointless activity , which is precisely why it 's so important .
if nothing else , you realize very quickly as a teenager , it is not a hit with girls to know captain kirk 's middle name .
and so i sold out way too young .
and i thought , well this is going to be child 's play .
watson 's actually huge .
i felt like a detroit factory worker of the ' 80s seeing a robot that could now do his job on the assembly line .
we 're just obeying a little talking voice on our dashboard .
who do i vote for ?
now when facts come in handy like that -- i love that story because it shows you the power of one fact , one remembered fact in exactly the right place at the right time -- normally something that 's easier to see on game shows than in real life .
i feel like our civilization works when this is a vast cultural heritage that we all share and that we know without having to outsource it to our devices , to our search engines and our smartphones .
we can live in a world where our brains , the things that we know , continue to be the thing that makes us special , or a world in which we 've outsourced all of that to evil supercomputers from the future like watson .
and as you can tell , they are basically goof balls .
it 's more like a mosh pit .
well this one isp in pakistan chose to effectuate the block for its subscribers in a rather unusual way .
and they came together to help find the problem and fix it .
how does it really work ? it turns out there is a back room that is kind of windowless , metaphorically speaking .
and wikipedia has embraced this .
they start off on all sorts of goofy projects .
and we now have means that we can build , like this system , so that people can report the filtering as they encounter it .
amazing how many successful couch surfings there have been .
in one of the battles that the prophet waged , he told his followers , " we are returning from the lesser war to the greater war , to the greater battle . "
and when i love my servant , " god says , " i become the eyes by which he or she sees , the ears by which he or she listens , the hand by which he or she grasps , and the foot by which he or she walks , and the heart by which he or she understands . "
but all this is for us to glorify the name of the creator whose primary name is the compassionating , the compassionate .
we have reached a stage in human history that we have no option : we must , we must lower our egos , control our egos -- whether it is individual ego , personal ego , family ego , national ego -- and let all be for the glorification of the one .
she sleeps with her cellphone , so do i.
people want to be with each other , but also elsewhere -- connected to all the different places they want to be .
texting , email , posting , all of these things let us present the self as we want to be .
and the feeling that no one is listening to me make us want to spend time with machines that seem to care about us .
and i believe it 's because technology appeals to us most where we are most vulnerable .
so before it was : i have a feeling , i want to make a call .
but it 's time to talk .
that we listen when technology says it will take something complicated and promises something simpler .
that 's how much of a latterly thing writing is .
for two hours before that , edward everett spoke on a topic that , frankly , cannot engage us today and barely did then .
that 's what we 're seeing in this fingered speech .
it 's a marker of empathy . it 's a marker of accommodation .
you 'll pat your thighs and look wistfully off into the distance , or you 'll say something like , " hmm , makes you think -- " when it really didn 't , but what you 're really -- — what you 're really trying to do is change the topic .
and so , the way i 'm thinking of texting these days is that what we 're seeing is a whole new way of writing that young people are developing , which they 're using alongside their ordinary writing skills , and that means that they 're able to do two things .
i try to keep my own face somewhat dispassionate .
this is the allen telescope array , about 350 miles from whatever seat you 're in right now .
i mean , how many of those star systems have planets ?
i happen to know what the consequence for me would be , because we 've had false alarms . this is 1997 , and this is a photo i made at about 3 o 'clock in the morning in mountain view here , when we were watching the computer monitors because we had picked up a signal that we thought , " this is the real deal . " all right ?
that 's one thing . another thing that 's for sure going to happen is that it will calibrate us .
polls taken , this poll was taken 10 years ago .
seti , on the other hand , is really simple .
it was like dustin hoffman in " the graduate , " right , when he said " plastics , " whatever that means , plastics .
what i see is the generation behind me .
let me give you some examples from a couple of areas which i think we all care about : health and education .
it 's not just these modern buildings which suffer .
this study in germany found the average noise level in classrooms is 65 decibels .
i don 't know of one in the world , and the opportunity is there to transform our experience in our cities .
here 's the thing , everybody loves a beautiful baby .
we partnered with a leading medical research institution here in boston .
well it turns out there 's this whole constellation of people who have to be involved in a product for it to be successful : manufacturing , financing , distribution , regulation .
so jaundice affects two-thirds of newborns around the world .
and keep in mind , mom maybe just had a c-section , so that 's already kind of a bummer .
so again , if we want people to trust a device , it has to look trustworthy .
last story here : i 've got a friend in india who told me that you haven 't really tested a piece of electronic technology for distribution in asia until you 've trained a cockroach to climb in and pee on every single little component on the inside .
i 've since learned that if you really want to make a difference in the world , you have to design outcomes .
if people want to use it in their labs for working on research , just reconstruct it yourself , because , you know , it might break in fedex .
it was quite a compelling experience , but not really , i suppose , a surprise to someone who 'd had his room full of the books .
i 'd argue today that we have incredibly powerful computers , but we don 't have very good software for them .
they 're very , very stiff . they stretch very , very little .
the whole green dream -- because it can be profitable .
you normally get a trivalent vaccine against three possible strains .
so if you tie that -- you have to tie that back with the law .
customer : i 'd like a batch of some zombie tracking cookies , thank you .
pollinator : deforestsaurus ! i should have known !
now , i had a lot to learn about my business , like branding and marketing , staying engaged with my customers , and seeing what sold the most and the least .
please , mr. and mrs. penn . would you just -- ah !
i had my own personal responses , but i also have a public role , and something needed to be said .
and the devastating events of the 20th century have forced people to question the cold , unfeeling god .
from time to time , one hears christians telling the story of how god organized things for them , so that everything worked out all right -- some difficulty overcome , some illness cured , some trouble averted , a parking space found at a crucial time .
perhaps god is testing us : testing our charity , or our faith .
but what if god doesn 't act ? what if god doesn 't do things at all ?
in the end , we have to say , " i don 't know . "
only doubts and questioning and uncertainty .
fn : really make a fully integrated product , something beautiful .
little did i know , lying curled up in my prim baby humidicrib in 1948 that i 'd been born at the right place and the right time , that i was in a country where i could participate in the technological revolution .
as one of them said to me , " ron , we ain 't going anywhere at the moment . "
it meant , for the first time , i could read back what i had typed into it .
but in 1989 , he teamed up with bill joyce to develop a program that would read out what was on the computer screen from the net or from what was on the computer .
many websites we can 't read using jaws and the other technologies .
i 'm so glad that the interaction between braille transcribers , volunteer readers and passionate inventors , has allowed this dream of reading to come true for me and for blind people throughout the world .
and it was a device that , in fact , is a model of the sky .
and then there is their location on the sky as seen from a certain latitude on the back plate . okay ?
first thing that you do is you select a star in the night sky , if you 're telling time at night .
he would not only know what time it was , he would also know where the sun would rise , and how it would move across the sky .
so , the earliest retes , for example , were very simple and primitive .
for the last 10 years , i 've been spending my time trying to figure out how and why human beings assemble themselves into social networks .
so here on the y-axis , we have the percent of the people affected , and on the x-axis , we have time .
some people have one connection , some have two , some have six , some have 10 connections .
but shifted to the left is what 's occurring in the central individuals .
and also , we had them [ actively ] email us a couple of times a week .
so bigger dots mean more of your friends have the flu .
well , some other scientists have estimated what would happen if you took a 30 percent random sample of these 1000 people , 300 people and immunized them .
and we see a blip up in the truckers ' purchases of fuel , and we know that a recession is about to end .
we 're not talking each other . we 're facing forward .
people with high working memory capacity tend to be good storytellers .
you should have started with z.
now , a central issue with working memory is that it 's limited .
we need to process what 's going on the moment it happens , not 10 minutes later , not a week later , at the moment .
i just got through reading " the great gatsby , " and i have a perfect idea of what he looks like in my head , so my own version .
i 'll tell you one quick story to illustrate what that 's been like for me .
i woke up , they opened the door , i went out to get some fresh air , and i looked and there was a man running across the runway .
first of all , this is where we 're projected to go with the u.s. contribution to global warming , under business as usual . efficiency in end-use electricity and end-use of all energy is the low-hanging fruit . efficiency and conservation : it 's not a cost ; it 's a profit . the sign is wrong .
it means : reduce your carbon dioxide emissions with the full range of choices that you make , and then purchase or acquire offsets for the remainder that you have not completely reduced . and what it means is elaborated at climatecrisis.net.
once it becomes a closed system , with u.s. participation , then everybody who 's on a board of directors -- how many people here serve on the board of directors of a corporation ?
so here 's my question for you : which one of these two guys was more likely to have voted for george bush , which for al gore ?
so , right now , please raise your hand -- down in the simulcast rooms , too , let 's let everybody see who 's here -- please raise your hand if you would say that you are liberal or left of center .
let 's study some moral psychology and see where it takes us .
this norman rockwell painting is called " the golden rule , " and we heard about this from karen armstrong , of course , as the foundation of so many religions .
but as my son , max , grows up in a liberal college town , how is this first draft going to get revised ?
we find this in every country we look at .
the answer , i think , is contained in this incredible triptych from hieronymus bosch , " the garden of earthly delights . "
if you want to give some of your own money to punish people who aren 't contributing , you can do that . "
yes , you do need to be concerned about harm , you do need a psychology of justice .
this is the great insight that all the asian religions have attained .
so what should you do ? am i telling you to not strive ?
what does a human brain have or do that no other brain does ?
gorillas can be two to three times larger than we are , so their brains should also be larger than ours , but instead it 's the other way around .
now , the beauty of a soup is that because it is soup , you can agitate it and make those nuclei be distributed homogeneously in the liquid , so that now by looking under the microscope at just four or five samples of this homogeneous solution , you can count nuclei , and therefore tell how many cells that brain had .
and so was darwin .
when you eat like a primate , you can 't afford both .
and what is it that we do that no other animal does , and which i believe was fundamental to allow us to reach that large , largest number of neurons in the cortex ?
promised virtues fall prey to the passions of the moment .
and the problem is that they can become biased , because you learn to over-use some of them and under-use the others .
or you can be transcendental future : namely , life begins after death .
i just want to say that we are applying this to many world problems : changing the drop-out rates of school kids , combating addictions , enhancing teen health , curing vets ' ptsd with time metaphors -- getting miracle cures -- promoting sustainability and conservation , reducing physical rehabilitation where there is a 50-percent drop out rate , altering appeals to suicidal terrorists , and modifying family conflicts as time-zone clashes .
what had been a really mild spring turned into a miserably hot summer .
my talent , my integrity , my values , everything about me remained the same .
and i cried .
it 's hard to believe that it 's less than a year since the extraordinary moment when the finance , the credit , which drives our economies froze .
and they were people who were not short of wit , or grace or energy , but they had no hope , no jobs , no prospects .
you can see it in daily life .
some , i think some of the bankers who have appear to have learned nothing and forgotten nothing .
and his life was a systematic experiment to find better social answers , not from a theory , but from experiment , and experiment involving the people with the best intelligence on social needs , which were usually the people living with those needs .
now , i want to end by saying a little bit about what i think this means for capitalism .
it depends on other systems , on ecology , on family , on community , and if these aren 't replenished , capitalism suffers too .
so among them , i have been a shepherdess , a truck driver , a factory worker , a cleaning lady .
and everywhere i lived , i learned the languages , but never mastered them .
so each window is an image and is a world that i often revisit .
i channel their history [ so that ] they have a place to go back to look at their life and its possibilities .
then i went to run 50k , then 60k .
it 's not autobiographical identities .
but i added weathervanes on both sides to show that they cover all directions .
you can also have function and form with public art .
so i can call it techno-crafted .
sb : wow , ok . i didn 't really realize what it was when i first saw it .
and pretty much everywhere there is power , there is the internet .
but it didn 't have quite the same pickup in the u.s.
do we have any ?
but it 's just the kind of thing that we just try out for fun and see where it goes .
i think usually , as companies get bigger , they find it really hard to have small , innovative projects .
and it 's sort of like a better version of the toolbar .
it makes it a really fun place to work .
because you can type , you know , any kind of thing into google , and you expect an answer back , right ?
and finally , it ended with " kiss my ass . "
but one of the things that we never discuss or we rarely discuss is the value and importance of human connection , relationships .
and i got back and looked at that teacher edition .
i have things to do , people to impress , and places to go . "
you made me feel like i was somebody , when i knew , at the bottom , i wasn 't .
at the end of that time , i went off to australia , about 20 years ago .
this is after accounting for smoking , social class , diet , all those other known risk factors .
now these three guys up here , furchgott , ignarro and murad , won the nobel prize for medicine back in 1998 .
it 's a species close to human , with several advantages over mice : they 're free , you don 't shave them , they feed themselves , and nobody pickets your office saying , " save the lab medical student . "
a few good things here : this appeared to be more marked in older people .
different wavelengths of light have different activities of doing that .
and this is ongoing work , but dermatologists -- i mean , i 'm a dermatologist .
now , at that time , camden , new jersey , was the most dangerous city in america .
it worked for the oakland a 's , and it worked in the state of new jersey .
so when i started my job at the arnold foundation , i came back to looking at a lot of these questions , and i came back to thinking about how we had used data and analytics to transform the way we did criminal justice in new jersey .
they 're being subjective , and we know what happens with subjective decision making , which is that we are often wrong .
at the top , you see the new criminal activity score , six of course being the highest , and then in the middle you see , " elevated risk of violence . "
and the artist that drew this observation test did some errors , had some mistakes -- there are more or less 12 mistakes .
you know very well about professors .
this is a dionaea , a venus fly trap hunting snails -- sorry for the snail .
plants are even able to communicate -- they are extraordinary communicators .
now , this is a root apex growing against a slope .
and another possibility is a technological possibility .
lb : this is my first work , created in november 2005 .
this is a joint effort between me and french artist jr .
interpreter : this one is called instant noodles .
it 's time again to talk about " inconvenient truth , " a truth that everyone is concerned about , but nobody is willing to talk about .
you should stay cool with the appropriate clothing .
and i just want to show you that i 'm not just preaching , but i also practice .
so after analyzing mounds of data , what we discovered was this : unemployment and poverty alone did not lead to the arab revolts of 2011 .
but pressed up against these democratic aspirations was a very different day-to-day experience , especially in egypt .
and the reason that they 're expecting a lot is because they have a new-found hope for the future .
now people have raised some real concerns about what the rise of islamist parties means for women .
if you think about the arguments we have , most of the time it 's shouting matches on cable television , ideological food fights on the floor of congress .
who else ?
and the point , the essential nature , of musical performance is to produce excellent music .
how many here would say that casey martin does have a right to use a golf cart ?
charlie : it doesn 't matter ; it 's not part of the game .
and they brought in jack nicklaus and arnold palmer .
but since it is the very nature of a game to have no object except amusement , that is , what distinguishes games from productive activity , it is quite impossible to say that any of a game 's arbitrary rules is essential . "
how many here favor the first policy : the state should recognize traditional marriage only ?
from flutes to golf courses to same-sex marriage -- that was a genius link .
there 's the one that cuts it , that you have to tear off .
audience : shake .
and next year , toilet paper .
the price of energy dropped .
and then came the list of the most obese cities in the country .
and i came to the conclusion that we had built an incredible quality of life if you happen to be a car .
now , the web address was thiscityisgoingonadiet.com.
through yet another funding source , we 're redesigning all of our inner city streets to be more pedestrian-friendly .
oklahomans leaving for california in large numbers for a better future .
and i want to tell you a quote from ralph emerson that one of my colleagues , you know , put on my wall in my office , and it says , " do not go where the path may lead .
but i said i 'm going to show you a short clip of one of our employees to kind of give you an idea about some of the talent that we have .
all that started from that big bang . so , the question is : how did that happen ? how did that evolve ? how did the universe form ?
and if you look at the height of it and you compare it to mount everest , you see , it 'll give you an idea of how large that mount olympus , you know , is , relative to mount everest .
if you were there you wouldn 't do it yourself .
ce : that 's about what happened in the houston operation room . it 's exactly like this .
lynn craig : where there tends to be water , at least on earth , there tends to be life , and so it 's potentially a place where life could have existed on the planet in the past .
lc : after the heat shield has been jettisoned and the legs are deployed , the next step is to have the radar system begin to detect how far phoenix really is from the ground .
so now let me talk about the next things that we are doing .
next step , we go and actually build some kind of test models and actually test them , you know , in the lab at jpl , in what we call our mars yard .
it 's real stuff .
and that 's one of the satellites which was actually formed on that one .
now , methane gets people all excited , because it 's organic material , so immediately people start thinking , could life have evolved in that location , when you have a lot of organic material .
you barely can see ourselves . so what i did , i thought i 'd zoom on it .
the world health organization estimates that there are nearly four to five hundred million people living on our tiny planet who are affected by a mental illness .
it became quickly apparent to me that i couldn 't follow the sorts of mental health care models that i had been trained in , one that relied heavily on specialized , expensive mental health professionals to provide mental health care in countries like india and zimbabwe .
it empowers ordinary people to be more effective in caring for the health of others in their community , and in doing so , to become better guardians of their own health . indeed , for me , task shifting is the ultimate example of the democratization of medical knowledge , and therefore , medical power .
and he could shoot it from two rooms away and not damage what it was on because he knew how to pump it just enough to kill the fly and not damage what it landed on .
and it would have " hand " in that it would be greatly crafted .
i 'm under the river with those fish .
and that was played by my mom .
he has all these discussions with their family , and he digs through everything they have , and he finds materials to make work .
and she makes them so they could either be broken up into payments , or they could be like these , which are leaves that can be payments .
we just have that natural way of seeing .
this is one of their founders , gert schaeffer .
the next , this is by sam sandy .
thank you . thanks .
i wanted to be like the explorers i 'd read about in the book , who went into the jungles of africa , went into the research labs and just tried to figure out what this deadly virus was . so from that moment on , i read every medical book i could get my hands on , and i just loved it so much .
at first when i heard of cancer stem cells , i didn 't really know how to put the two together . i 'd heard of stem cells , and i 'd heard of them as the panacea of the future -- the therapy of many diseases to come in the future , perhaps .
shouldn 't we think about manipulation , rather than elimination ?
so i decided to ask why . and here 's some of , i guess , my hypotheses that i 'll be starting to investigate this may at the sylvester cancer institute in miami .
is it possible that skeletal muscle doesn 't express this type of molecules ?
and again , some of these may be far-fetched , but i figured if there 's anywhere to present far-fetched ideas , it 's here at ted , so thank you very much .
i looked into the face of one of these women , and i saw in her face the strength that arises when natural compassion is really present .
and there are various facets .
the very word terror is global .
it takes tremendous strength of the back to uphold yourself in the midst of conditions .
the wound is just filled with maggots .
i was looking for a picture of graffiti , little text input language , and i found the website dedicated to teachers who want to make these , you know , the script writing things across the top of their blackboard , and they had added graffiti to it , and i 'm sorry about that .
but i was a little disappointed -- pretty young -- but i went back again a few years later and this time was in california , and i went to berkeley .
rarely , you know : evolution did this and copernicus did this , where we have a new understanding of who we are .
some people say , well , we don 't still have enough data , we need to get more information , there 's all these things we don 't know .
it 's got a lot of cells in it too , right ?
it was an intuitive , strong-held belief that was wrong .
a behavioral metric of what intelligence is , and this has stuck in our minds for a long period of time .
first thing that happened in evolution with mammals , we started to develop a thing called the neocortex .
in humans -- by the way , this is true for all mammals ; it 's true for other mammals -- and in humans , it got a lot worse .
as i put my hand on this table , i expect to feel it stop .
then , if in that framework , you take a bunch of theoreticians .
if you don 't build it , you don 't understand it . so , one more slide here .
i know a lot of people who invented the microprocessor and if you talk to them , they knew what they were doing was really significant , but they didn 't really know what was going to happen .
you see , unlike the woman the night before , this woman had type 2 diabetes .
this is called fuel partitioning in the lingo .
i 'm not suggesting that obesity is benign , but what i am suggesting is it may be the lesser of two metabolic evils .
and by the way , they don 't appear to be at any greater risk of disease than lean people .
i 've been humbled enough by all i don 't know .
if obesity is nothing more than a proxy for metabolic illness , what good does it do us to punish those with the proxy ?
it also uses photons , but they 're all synchronized , and if you focus them into a beam , what you have is an incredibly useful tool .
because if you 're trying to give someone the big picture of a complex idea , to really capture its essence , the fewer words you use , the better .
it 's basically efficient brainstorming , and when i visited david to learn about his research , he used dancers to explain it to me rather than the usual method : powerpoint .
once we eliminate public funding for the artists , let 's put them back to work by using them instead of powerpoint .
it 's something we have to , too , and that means the people who are working on counterterrorism responses have to start , in effect , putting on their google-tinted glasses , or whatever .
the other thing to do is to knock the product , attack the brand myth , as we 've said .
it burnt my hand , whatever . " you believe them .
we 're all here , and all of those who watch it are going to be traumatized by this event , but all of you here who are victims are going to learn some hard truths .
we see it as terrorism versus democracy in that brand war .
we brought a private action , and thank god , 10 years later , we actually won it . there is a slight appeal on at the moment so i have to be a bit careful , but i 'm fairly confident .
it self-educates both sides , enables a better understanding , reveals the strengths and weaknesses , and yes , like some of the speakers before , the shared vulnerability does lead to trust , and it does then become , that process , part of normalization .
it 's a question that 's been tackled by many great thinkers and writers : what if society actually needs crisis to change ?
and yet , i 've taken that idea and made it my own .
if it 's population , we 're on course to top the charts .
india has more all-news tv channels than any country in the world , in fact in most of the countries in this part of the world put together .
or you could pay eight times the going rate for something called a lightning call .
and that transformation is part of where india is heading today .
weddings were reported to be interrupted so guests could cluster around the t.v. set , and then turn their attention back to the bride and groom .
because india has been an open society for millennia .
so india now is no longer the nationalism of ethnicity or language or religion , because we have every ethnicity known to mankind , practically , we 've every religion know to mankind , with the possible exception of shintoism , though that has some hindu elements somewhere .
that 's why india belongs at ted , and that 's why ted belongs in india .
so over the past several years i 've been continuing to explore this interpersonal dimension of robots , now at the media lab with my own team of incredibly talented students .
people use these cues to determine things like how persuasive someone is , how likable , how engaging , how trustworthy .
the first was just the screen .
and as grandma-bot , she can now play , really play , with my sons , with her grandsons , in the real world with his real toys .
so an interesting question is , does the social embodiment really matter ? does it matter that it 's a robot ?
my sons , they love the screen . they love the screen .
i want them to be able to literally build their imagination into these experiences and make them their own .
really what we want to hear is music .
owl , yeah .
and this is a video that was taken by my surgical mentor , dr. john niparko , who implanted her .
and there 's no way that you can 't look at that as an overwhelming success .
i mean , most of us know that pitch is a fundamental building block of music .
cochlear implant users cannot tell the difference between these instruments .
because his grave was exhumed .
but although these hearing aids were the most powerful hearing aids on the market at the time , they weren 't very helpful .
but i tell you , if we lost our hearing , if anyone here suddenly lost your hearing , you would want perfect hearing back .
i like to think that wood gives mother nature fingerprints in our buildings .
we don 't think about it a lot , and unfortunately , we actually don 't even think about buildings , i think , as much as we should .
that 's what people jump to as a conclusion .
or , the last thing we want to do is cut down the wrong trees .
it just happens to be that mother nature holds the patent , and we don 't really feel comfortable with it .
for example , no one can do two notes at the same time .
so i 'm going to start another beat for you , like this .
i 've made this so that i can make any noise that i can imagine .
and so forget about evolution in a kind of metaphysical way .
and as i pause for a few seconds , have a look at the screen .
if we can make matter alive , would we have a matterhazard ?
so before we can really start to make life , we have to really think about where it came from .
so we have some kind of primordial soup .
so if you have a container , it 's like getting in your car .
and that is the key .
the real issue in cellular biology is we are never going to understand everything , because it 's a multidimensional problem put there by evolution .
when ?
and mayan inscriptions proclaim that he was deeply in love with his wife .
i 've never had the opportunity to say it before .
we found activity in some cells called the a10 cells , cells that actually make dopamine , a natural stimulant , and spray it to many brain regions .
as the poet terence , the roman poet once said , he said , " the less my hope , the hotter my love . "
i think of all the poetry that i 've read about romantic love , what sums it up best is something that is said by plato , over 2,000 years ago .
and indeed , there are now three academic articles in which they 've looked at this attraction , which may only last for a second , but it 's a definite attraction , and either this same brain region , this reward system , or the chemicals of that reward system are involved .
your childhood certainly plays a role , but nobody knows how .
this is intimacy to women .
one : fewer people on a fixed amount of land make investing in property a bad bet .
if we can make it through the next 150 years , i think that your great great grandchildren will forget all about malthus .
so we made this thing .
you can spray ; the problem is there are environmental issues .
because if you actually look through your fingernails , you can see blood vessels , and once you see blood vessels , we think we can see the malaria .
you can give drug administration .
here , we 're trying to visualize the airflow around the wings of the mosquito with little particles we 're illuminating with a laser .
clinics are full of people that have malaria .
we have the device over here .
the energy 's a little bit high here .
so it has neither the resources , nor the incentives , to hook up many other users .
now , you won 't be surprised to learn that the rules in north korea keep people there in the dark .
it plots income , average income in china as a percentage of average income in the united states .
if you try to change the rules in a village , you could do that , but a village would be too small to get the kinds of benefits you can get if you have millions of people all working under good rules .
the final thing we need are choices for leaders .
allow a new city to be built up there .
and let these dots represent the land that 's already taken up by the cities that three billion people now live in .
so the incentives for the people helping to construct this zone and build it , and set up the basic rules , go very much in the right direction .
it brings together intelligent machines , advanced analytics , and the creativity of people at work .
let 's start with aviation .
just a one-percent reduction in existing inefficiencies could yield savings of over 60 billion dollars to the healthcare industry worldwide , and that is just a drop in the sea compared to what we need to do to make healthcare affordable on a sustainable basis .
second , there is a concern that in the future , there will only be room for engineers , data scientists , and other highly-specialized workers .
we are just at the beginning of this transformation , and there will be barriers to break , obstacles to overcome .
you want to be a little bit ahead of the competition , but not too far ahead .
the contest said , send in your numbers and whoever is close to two-thirds of the average will win a big prize .
that is , it 's a circuit that 's used to imagine what other people might do .
they play lots of trials with different amounts each time .
it 's a little too complicated to explain right now , but the theory tells you that this shape kind of should occur .
you might be thinking back to your last thanksgiving .
wrong .
now we move the payoffs .
he said , you know , there 's this fiscal cliff coming , it 's going to come at the beginning of 2013 .
the dark blue line is how much the government spends .
that 's not going to create an equitable , fair society .
everyone hates that equally , but republicans and democrats hate that together .
a tiny little sliver call themselves libertarians , or socialists , or some other small third party , and the largest block , 40 percent , say they 're independents .
the vast majority of people , they pick and choose , they see compromise and they change over time when they hear a better argument or a worse argument .
and nothing happened at all .
really , it happened here in san francisco to a famous chef .
to take advantage of when the temperature drops in the fall , geese and ducks gorge on food to prepare for the harsh realities of winter .
couldn 't find a shred of evidence .
and i thought , ok , excited jew from new york , right ?
why ?
the other 50 percent , he takes and he sells and he makes money on them .
so i 'm listening to all this , you know , and i 'm like , is this guy for real ? is he making some of this up ?
and i look at eduardo , who 's near tears looking at this , and i say , " you 're telling me that your geese are calling to the wild geese to say come for a visit ? "
and the problem with saying that , of course , is that you know , at this point it risks hyperbole really easily .
he takes the liver when he harvests the foie gras , he sticks them in this jar and he confits it .
what do you think of foie gras that 99.99999 percent of the world eats ?
the pharaoh got wind of this and wanted to taste it .
take more , sell more , waste more .
i work for the red cross and i 'm a physical therapist .
it was a strange sensation .
behind him there was a child , his son , red in the face in an effort to push the father .
i was ready to tell him , " listen , if someone such-and-such comes tomorrow , please tell him that it was a mistake .
when you have 20 people in front of you , looking at you and you are the one who has to decide ...
but finally , the great day arrived .
later on , we took them home .
" my children are growing .
and then he said , " no , we can modify the workbench maybe to put a special stool , a special anvil , special vice , and maybe an electric screwdriver . "
of course , i understood that what made him stand tall -- yeah they were the legs , thank you very much -- but as a first step , it was the dignity .
so employing people , yes , but also we started programming projects of microfinance , education .
i said , " no , no , no , no , we can 't . "
i had been tremendously invigorated by the knowledge and creativity that i found in that country , which had 60 percent landlessness but amazing creativity .

at the age of 70 , he is linking up something very creative .
and a professor in the university of massachusetts , in the zoology department , bought this climber because she wanted to study the insect diversity of the top of the tree canopy .
and in south africa , we had taken our innovators , and many of us had gone there share with the colleagues in south africa as to how innovation can become a means of liberation from the drudgery that people have .
we have sold things all over the world , from ethiopia to turkey to u.s. to wherever .
and yet , we began .
no matter what level you look at , whether it 's at the ecosystem level or at the species level or at the genetic level , we see the same problem again and again .
and you can 't really have a proper model for development if at the same time you 're destroying or allowing the degradation of the very asset , the most important asset , which is your development asset , that is ecological infrastructure .
but on the other hand , if you start measuring , how much would it actually cost to restore the land of the shrimp farm back to productive use ?
in fact , this was what really inspired my interest in this phase .
the way to do this is to do it on a company basis , to take leadership forward , and to do it for as many important sectors which have a cost , and to disclose these answers .
it 's about energy emissions .
these red dots , these red areas , basically provide the food and livelihood for more than half a billion people .
how did that feel when they came and whisked you away , and your lifestyle completely changed ?
that 's wonderful , but we should also remember that we should have a similar process happening on the inside .
and so , what i think it comes down to is a question of , not only having information of what 's going on , but paying attention to that and letting that shift our motivation to become more sincere and genuinely positive .
so 14 years ago , almost , in the middle of the rwandan genocide , in which 800,000 people would be systematically exterminated by the rwandan government and some extremist militia .
there 's a museum , of course , on the mall in washington , right next to lincoln and jefferson .
they have a 1-800-genocide number -- this is going to sound very kitsch , but for those of you who may not be , i mean , may be apolitical , but interested in doing something about genocide , you dial 1-800-genocide and you type in your zip code , and you don 't even have to know who your congressperson is .
the first is that the movement , such as it is , stops at america 's borders . it is not a global movement .
it 's hard to remember , but there was actually a time in the summer of 2003 , even after the u.s. invasion , where , apart from looting , civilians were relatively safe in iraq .
sergio was in beirut when the u.s. embassy was hit by the first-ever suicide attack against the united states .
he 's the guy put in charge . he 's the paul bremer or the jerry bremer of first kosovo and then east timor . he governs the places .
i want to wrap up , but i want to close with what i take to be the four lessons from sergio 's life on this question of how do we prevent evil from prevailing , which is how i would have framed the question .
you can actually do far more to build an international coalition against a harmdoer or a wrongdoer by being in the room and showing to the rest of the world that that person , that regime , is the problem and that you , the united states , are not the problem .

in saskatchewan , as across all of the boreal , home to some of our most famous rivers , an incredible network of rivers and lakes that every school-age child learns about , the peace , the athabasca , the churchill here , the mackenzie , and these networks were the historical routes for the voyageur and the coureur des bois , the first non-aboriginal explorers of northern canada that , taking from the first nations people , used canoes and paddled to explore for a trade route , a northwest passage for the fur trade .
and line those trucks / homes back and forth across there from the bottom all the way to the top .
so they decided to call it oil sands .
and yet , on the front porch of that man 's cabin , i saw four fish . he had to feed his family to survive .
this is what 's planned for 2015 .
and i quite simply think that this is not something that should be decided just in canada .
ladies and gentlemen , the creation of life .

it demands that we optimize ourselves , that we control ourselves , that we self-manage continuously because that 's the only way in which such a liberal society works .
because if you look at the beginning of ethics in western culture , you see a very different idea of what ethics also could be .
no matter whether we as designers intend it or not , we materialize morality .
" why should the lamp or the house be an art object , but not our life ? "
what is this ant doing ? what is this in aid of ?
there are a lot of ideas to die for .
it 's not maximizing the number of grandchildren we have .
so we have to keep plugging away , trying to correct the misapprehensions so that only the benign and useful variants of our ideas continue to spread .
remember the shakers ? gift to be simple ?
i 've not time to go into more of it .
but we should recognize that for many people in the world , they are a big deal .
jean-michel basquiat , important to me because [ he was ] the first black artist in real time that showed me the possibility of who and what i was about to enter into .
i always say harlem is an interesting community because , unlike many other places , it thinks of itself in the past , present and the future simultaneously ; no one speaks of it just in the now .
to this end , the specific project that has made this possible for me is a series of exhibitions , all titled with an f -- freestyle , frequency and flow -- which have set out to discover and define the young , black artists working in this moment who i feel strongly will continue to work over the next many years .
so the last iteration of this project has been called flow , with the idea now of creating a real network of artists around the world ; really looking , not so much from harlem and out , but looking across , and flow looked at artists all born on the continent of africa .
now , let me tell you a different story . around june 2002 , the world of supercomputers had a bombshell .

five minutes i 'll spend just because it 's interesting . just because it 's fun .
it is about the future of the freedom to be as social beings with each other , and the way information , knowledge and culture will be produced .

1991 , ' 92 , we found a finance minister and a prime minister willing to let the world look at india , rather than be this great country of intrigue and mystery in this closed country .
we got to the final , and then this moment , that will remain enshrined forever , for everybody , take a look .
one was war , the indian army , which we don 't like to happen very often .
and they 've started promoting them with huge money behind it .
but what this also did was it started marrying the two most important things in indian cricket , which is cricket and the movies in indian entertainment .

well it turns out that the computer analogy is just as valid for emotion .
he was my jedi and my rabbi while he was here , and seymour taught me both to love flies and also to play with science .
more puffs , or more intense puffs , make the state last for a longer period of time .
then when you give those trained flies the chance to choose between a tube with the shock-paired odor and another odor , it avoids the tube containing the blue odor that was paired with shock .
so these results make me and my colleagues more convinced than ever that the brain is not a bag of chemical soup , and it 's a mistake to try to treat complex psychiatric disorders just by changing the flavor of the soup .
that really involves designing behaviors and personality into products .
but if you push the button , of course , the whole wall goes dark .
he 's always been interested in technology in the future .
in contrast to if you went inside the dome , where it 's kind of wild and crazy and everybody 's learning all kinds of things , or fooling around , or whatever they 're doing .
maneuvering the spyfish is simple with the wireless remote control .
and in my own practice , from product to approtec , it 's really exciting that we 're taking a more human-centered approach to design , that we 're including behaviors and personalities in the things we do , and i think this is great .
a uniform , she said , and asked for my measurements .
and somaly mam , a cambodian activist who fights passionately against child prostitution .

reaching success , i worked hard , i pushed myself .
i was faster but just as depressed .
and when i went back to following these eight principles , the black cloud over my head disappeared altogether .
paper maps are becoming obsolete .
you 'll buy gps dots in bulk , and you 'll stick them on everything you own worth more than a few tens of dollars .

the fake signals now completely control this gps receiver .
and " you can trust us . "
but will you be able to resist the temptation to track your fellow man ?
paldin is a 62-year-old monk .
this is jigme and her sister , sonam .
and in this period of time -- since that time -- as much oil , or twice as much oil as was spilled in the exxon valdez accident , was spilled in this little area of the amazon , and the tribes in this area have constantly had to move .
so it was a great experience for him . he stayed up all night with them , drumming and dancing .
and the way we 've done this -- we teach digital storytelling to these kids .
so what i 'd like to show you now , in the couple of minutes i have left , is a film that a student made in guatemala .
and during my ph.d , i wanted to know exactly what chemicals from our skin mosquitos used , african malarial mosquitos use to track us down at night .

see that ? they won 't let me on a plane with that , but they 'll give it to me on the plane .
so there 's points , and these points are actually being cross-referenced .
this , by the way , is the location of my favorite sandwich shop in california -- vietnamese sandwich .
and one of the reasons , also being part of the user-unfriendliness , is that everything is there , but you have to really work through it .
i 'm still doing this project , but it is obsolete , because you 're all doing it .
and i 'm glad that we have patrons of the arts in these fields .
one is power transition , which is change of power amongst states .
but to be able to do it , you had to be very rich -- a government , a multinational corporation , maybe the catholic church -- but you had to be pretty wealthy .
and that ability to get others to want what you want , to get the outcomes you want without coercion or payment , is what i call soft power .
but in fact , what we 've seen is none of those were true .
it 's all very one-dimensional .
for one thing , germany had surpassed britain in industrial strength by 1900 .
power can also be positive sum , where your gain can be my gain .
and if we 're going to deal with these two great power shifts that i 've described , the power shift represented by transition among states , the power shift represented by diffusion of power away from all states , we 're going to have to develop a new narrative of power in which we combine hard and soft power into strategies of smart power .
more specifically , we created this website , openrov.com , and shared our intentions and our plans for the first few months , it was just eric and i talking back to each other on the forums , but pretty soon , we started to get feedback from makers and hobbyists , and then actually professional ocean engineers who had some suggestions for what we should do .
well , we didn 't find any gold , but we decided that what we found was much more valuable .
most parents would find that great .
the other way that they are better is actually being able to resolve different levels of gray .
actually , those action video game players have many other advantages in terms of attention , and one aspect of attention which is also improved for the better is our ability to track objects around in the world .
now , when we do brain imaging , we find that all three of these networks are actually much more efficient in people that play action games .
i showed that to you already , like we looked at the fact that despite a lot of screen time , those action gamers have a lot of very good vision , etc .
like , the reason that i asked you to do that is because you really feel your brain cringing , right ?
e : hello .
e : ooh .
sw : or maybe sirena huang would like to learn some arias on her violin , and einstein can sing along with some opera ?
e : hey , baby .
sw : and the penguin ?
sw : yeah . you are a superstar .
these ideas have brought together something which has made india happen the way it is today .
then there is the whole northern india , which is going to be the bulk of the future demographic dividend .
twenty years back , when there was a report on bank computerization , they didn 't name the report as a report on computers , they call them as " ledger posting machines . "
unfortunately the government schools don 't function , so children are going to private schools today .
again , an idea which is arrived , but not yet implemented .
therefore we need to create a new set of labor laws , which are not as onerous as they are today .
therefore when you are a young country , again you have a chance to put in place a modern pension system so that you don 't create entitlement problems as you grow old .

last year was the biggest year .
he didn 't actually buy anything , just some data .
i wanted to update that video and give you a new look at it .
i , like many of you , live somewhere between reality and video games .
video games are nearing an evolutionary leap , a point where game worlds will look and feel just as real as the films we see in theatres , or the news we watch on tv .
my fate and the fate of the world around me lie inside my hands .
today i believe big brother would find much more success brainwashing the masses with video games rather than just simply tvs .
is it going to come from the best directors in the world as we thought it probably would ?
she 's never going to know a world where you can 't press a button and have millions of people ready to play .

that 's the warm colors which show a well-sampled region .
for example , while it 's hard to believe that a three kilogram lobster could elude scientists , it did until a few years ago when south african fishermen requested an export permit and scientists realized that this was something new to science .
if you were to suck all the water out of the ocean , this is what you 'd be left behind with , and that 's the biomass of life on the sea floor .

the rural areas are no longer producing as much food as they did .
and the newly emerging diseases may make h5n1 and bird flu a quaint forerunner of things to come . it 's a destabilized world .
and now let 's look from the south , looking up , and let 's see this in relief .
we 've been here before , paralyzed by fear , paralyzed into inaction , when some -- probably one of you in this room -- jumped into the breach and created an organization like physicians for social responsibility , which fought against the nuclear threat , medicins sans frontieres , that renewed our commitment to disaster relief , mohamed elbaradei , and the tremendous hope and optimism that he brought all of us , and our own muhammad yunus .

a high entropy arrangement is one that there are many arrangements that look that way .
so he says -- i 'm not going to do the accent -- he says , " for some reason , the universe , at one time , had a very low entropy for its energy content , and since then the entropy has increased .
back when i was your age , we didn 't know what the universe was going to do .
it will probably increase , and the probability is enormously huge .
that 's the region where entropy is low .
here is the universe that we tell you about , versus the universe that really exists .
you could be a random fluctuation out of the nothingness .
but we 've been thinking as a human race about what the universe was like , why it came to be in the way it did for many , many years .

one of the last 10,000 years and the other , certainly of the last 25 years , that are going to have an impact on these three different brain systems : lust , romantic love and deep attachment to a partner .
and it 's going to have an impact .
almost always , when i 'm on tv , the producers who call me , who negotiate what we 're going to say , is a woman .
and i say , " why do you think more men are adulterous than women ? "
and i looked -- for one of my books , i looked at divorce data in 58 societies .
so i don 't think , honestly , we 're an animal that was built to be happy ; we are an animal that was built to reproduce .

and i also think that you gravitate to certain people , actually , with somewhat complementary brain systems .
they 're going to survive as long as our species survives on what shakespeare called " this mortal coil . "
the problem is that these pups need a stable platform of solid ice in order to nurse from their moms .
if we weren 't so efficient at catching them , because they grow their entire life , would have 30-year-old bluefin out there that weigh a ton .
but this one morning i jumped in and found this thresher that had just recently died in the gill net .
but it 's an animal that 's about 98 percent in decline throughout most of its range .
this is a photograph that shows a hatchling about to taste saltwater for the very first time beginning this long and perilous journey .
they hold on to them , and it eventually kills them .
but when the fish came back and began predating and controlling the urchin population , low and behold , kelp forests emerged in shallow water .
weather is an amalgam of systems that is inherently invisible to most of us .
the vertical elements are assigned a specific hour of the day .
so for me , that was my way into it .
in october of 1903 , the prevailing opinion of expert aerodynamicists was that maybe in 10 million years we could build an aircraft that would fly .
at mach 20 , we can fly from new york to long beach in 11 minutes and 20 seconds .
and while there 's no substitute for speed , maneuverability is a very close second .
we cannot both fear failure and make amazing new things -- like a robot with the stability of a dog on rough terrain , or maybe even ice ; a robot that can run like a cheetah , or climb stairs like a human with the occasional clumsiness of a human .
experiments suggest that lightning could be the next gps .
it allows us to contribute and to be heard as individuals .
now i want to say , this is not easy .
and remember , be nice to nerds .
but not necessarily just a camera ?
that 's what we do .
my archive : 175 films , my 16-millimeter negative , all my books , my dad 's books , my photographs .
that 's me at my desk .
that 's my father 's letter to me , telling me to marry the woman i first married when i was 20 .
they are cells in dishes and animal testing .
and at the wyss institute , we 've done just that .
now the chip is really beautiful , but what can we do with it ?
when they get damaged , say , by cigarette smoke for example , they don 't work properly , and they can 't clear that mucus out .
does it get cleared by the liver ?
we 're really seeing something quite incredible at the wyss institute .
personalized medicine . thank you .
but we hold them in san francisco -- -- and in new york .
you know what those are , right ?
they 're a bit subversive in what they do .
he 's just a kid that grew up playing with tools instead of toys .
it 's a micro-controller .
and they do interesting things .
this is very strange for me , because i 'm not used to doing this : i usually stand on the other side of the light , and now i 'm feeling the pressure i put other people into . and it 's hard ...
nigeria .
marcus : it feeds my mind and my soul .
boy : see man , you 're just taking the piss out of me now .
did you ever move your fuckin ' ass from hollywood to go and film something real ?
there 's a young director , hollywood director , with his friends -- fellow filmmakers -- talking about what cinema means .
i don 't remember how we got there .
mariam is pregnant .
state your name and age for the commission .
no .
that was a very moving piece .
you could look at nature as being like a catalog of products , and all of those have benefited from a 3.8-billion-year research and development period .
and at the end of the project we worked out that the weight of that superstructure was actually less than the weight of the air inside the building .
graham wiles has continued to add more and more elements to this , turning waste streams into schemes that create value .
and this animation , this shows photosynthetic activity over the course of a number of years , and what you can see is that the boundaries of those deserts shift quite a lot , and that raises the question of whether we can intervene at the boundary conditions to halt , or maybe even reverse , desertification .
so it was like a green inkblot spreading out from the building turning barren land back into biologically productive land -- and in that sense , going beyond sustainable design to achieve restorative design .
you think , " what can i add to the system to create more value ? "
but perhaps more than anything , what this thinking provides is a really positive way of talking about sustainable design .
i moved out of the house , i got a job , i found a girl , i settled down -- and i realize it sounds like a bad sitcom or a cat stevens ' song -- but life was pretty good .
i spoke to him on the phone at 10 : 30 p.m.
and the surprise and just the amazement of that was only overshadowed by my return to toronto , when , in my inbox , 10 literary agents were waiting for me to talk about putting this into a book .
i love hanging out with three year-olds .
these were four guys on the l.a. rams in the 1960s you did not want to go up against .
i don 't know , because i never did it , but i would imagine that it would take a great attitude .
they 've got an apple here from south africa .
you can go to a concert and hear guitars jamming .
this was part of a challenge i did to take a picture every day for a month .
there 's nothing wrong with big , crazy challenges .
it 's downtowns becoming ghost towns .
so the public school students are about 86 percent african-american .
but this is our front porch . we live there .
and so this played out for us in a couple different ways .
it 's a systems-level look at how education is administered and what is being offered and to whom .
so we thought , what if you could bring back shop class , but this time orient the projects around things that the community needed , and to infuse shop class with a more critical and creative-design-thinking studio process .
he is 16 years old , loves hunting and fishing and being outside and doing anything with his hands , and so for him , studio h means that he can stay interested in his education through that hands-on engagement .
because you may notice that what 's actually happening is that the egg is unscrambling itself .
and in this way , complexity builds stage by stage .
and at first , it 's just a blur , but very quickly distinct things begin to appear in that blur .
we have our first stars .
what are the goldilocks conditions ?
and dna , of course , is the beautiful molecule that contains that information .
terrible news for the dinosaurs , but great news for our mammalian ancestors , who flourished in the niches left empty by the dinosaurs .
each migration involved learning -- learning new ways of exploiting the environment , new ways of dealing with their surroundings .
we 're burning fossil fuels at such a rate that we seem to be undermining the goldilocks conditions that made it possible for human civilizations to flourish over the last 10,000 years .
he hides his sensitivities and romantic side , because in russia , among guys , that 's not cool to be romantic , but it 's cool to be surrounded with women and look like an aggressive hulk .
this is a projection that can see the viewer as the viewer walks by .
and , of course , it 's one that 's dear to my heart , because all of these sentiments -- some banal , some a bit more profound -- all originally had come out of my diary .
and suddenly she sees a tank ambling down the main road of sarajevo knocking everything out of its path .
it was a very somber gathering of the reporters that worked there during the war , humanitarian aid workers , and of course the brave and courageous people of sarajevo themselves .
and an aid worker friend of mine told me the most beautiful story , or i find it beautiful .
i 'm not even a humanitarian aid doctor , and i can 't tell you the times of how helpless i 've felt to have people dying in front of me , and i couldn 't save them .
i see , i see one way in the back .
25 . now , the way we can square on most calculators -- let me demonstrate with this one -- is by taking the number , such as five , hitting " times " and then " equals , " and on most calculators that will give you the square .
let me try to take this one step further .
722 is 500 -- ooh , that 's a harder one .
thank you very much .
what i 'd like each of you to do is to call out for me any six of your seven digits , any six of them , in any order you 'd like .
by any chance , does anybody here happen to know the day of the week that they were born on ?
sixth -- was that a friday ? audience : yes .
audience : 17th . 17th -- i believe that was a sunday .
i know as a magician we 're not supposed to reveal our secrets , but i 'm not too afraid that people are going to start doing my show next week , so -- i think we 're ok .
i store them as words , and later on retrieve them as numbers .
if his cookie was even slightly bigger than my cookie , i had questions .
it doesn 't even occur to us that we should .
i woke up the next morning .
in fact , scientists have concluded that taken together , chronic loneliness poses as significant a risk for your longterm health and longevity as cigarette smoking .
and then you 'll be even more convinced you can 't succeed .
our minds and our feelings , they 're not the trustworthy friends we thought they were .
i 'm going to take a knife and see how much deeper i can make it . "
i couldn 't stop thinking about how much he was suffering , even though he never complained , not once .
i can , because that 's the world i want to live in , and that 's the world my brother wants to live in as well .
we just don 't do that , although a night in the temple bar district can get pretty wild .
and of course , we are all capable of understanding these symbols .
so when i stepped off the boat 12 years ago , i tried to make sense of that , because exploring a city on foot only gets you so far .
we distributed these rapid transport corridors throughout the city center , and extended them into the outskirts .
and of course , for my own self , i was very happy to see that my folks in germany and greece finally have an idea what i do for a living . thank you .
let 's face it : the way i wanted my tea was inappropriate according to cultural standards , and they were doing their best to help me save face .
in reality , the kids who were told what to do , whether by miss smith or their mothers , were actually given the very same activity , which their counterparts in the first group had freely chosen .
people that have grown up in such a paradigm might find it motivating , but it is a mistake to assume that everyone thrives under the pressure of choosing alone .
but for eastern europeans , the sudden availability of all these consumer products on the marketplace was a deluge .
it 's not a marker of liberation , but of suffocation by meaningless minutiae .
they had all suffered the same tragedy .
the story americans tell , the story upon which the american dream depends , is the story of limitless choice .
thank you .
and they said , " well , one is elegant , the other one 's glamorous . "
and traffic planners all around the world have tried lots of different measures : dense cities or dispersed cities , lots of roads or lots of public transport or lots of bike lanes or more information , or lots of different things , but nothing seems to work .
and then someone came up with the idea that , apart from good public transport , apart from spending money on roads , let 's try to charge drivers one or two euros at these bottlenecks .
but it was fun anyway .
they 're not even aware of this themselves .
in a nuclear power plant , you have a big pot of water that 's under high pressure , and you have some fuel rods , and these fuel rods are encased in zirconium , and they 're little pellets of uranium dioxide fuel , and a fission reaction is controlled and maintained at a proper level , and that reaction heats up water , the water turns to steam , steam turns the turbine , and you produce electricity from it .
and we have a lot of it sitting around , because this is a big problem .
so you have what 's called the xenon pit , and so some of these fission products love neutrons .
you can put them anywhere in the world you want to .
and i think , i think , that looking at the technology , this will be cheaper than or the same price as natural gas , and you don 't have to refuel it for 30 years , which is an advantage for the developing world .
one problem that 's happening now is , although the rates of happiness are about as flat as the surface of the moon , depression and anxiety are rising .
we 're wired for dangers that are immediate , that are physical , that are imminent , and so our body goes into an incredible reaction where endogenous opioids come in .
but somehow it was not put forward until very recently , seeing these as two parallel systems .
one is the reward system , and that 's fed by the chemical dopamine .
extroverts use it more than introverts .
and being alone is very unnatural to the human .
but it 's not irrelevant .
" there is only one question : how to love this world ? "
in fact , i went to nashville .
and i see , even more importantly , the power of music to connect hearts .
so i 'm still perplexed about what the true meaning of technology is as it relates to humanity , as it relates to nature , as it relates to the spiritual .
and i 'm applying a similar trick to say , what if we looked at the universe in our culture through the eyes of technology ? what does technology want ?
and here we have a view of evolution where rather than having evolution go over the linear time , we have it coming out from the center .
and so the general , long-term trends of evolution are roughly these five : ubiquity , diversity , specialization , complexity and socialization . now , i took that and said , ok , what are the long-term trends in technology ?
this is niles eldredge . he was the co-developer with stephen jay gould of the theory of punctuated equilibrium .
i don 't know who needs a corn sheller .
that 's the definition of " infinite game . " a finite game is play to win , and an infinite game is played to keep playing .
that 's what technology really wants .
but how efficient is , really , this multitasking ?
she went to school to get the information because that 's where the information lived .
they produced an election forum booklet for the entire town to learn more about their candidates .
and so we chose to look at paul rusesabagina as an example of a gentleman who singularly used his life to do something positive .
i almost never show them off because of the issue of the idea of failure .
and then we went to another one -- it didn 't have great visuals , but it had great information -- and spent an hour talking about the learning process , because it wasn 't about whether or not it was perfect , or whether or not it was what i could create .
and it 's interesting , when you look at the predictions made during the peak of the boom in the 1990s , about e-commerce , or internet traffic , or broadband adoption , or internet advertising , they were all right -- they were just wrong in time .
many technologies , at that point , displace another technology , and that 's another important point .
and then finally , dvds are approaching free .
the generics came in , first in brazil and elsewhere , and the effect was just dramatic on pricing .
and once you have electric motors , you can do anything : you can change the structure of the car in any way you want .
they 're facing a force that they haven 't faced before .
so when i had my ted wish last year , i said , look , i 'm going to switch my concept .
they really make inside out their own project .
i don 't have to explain to you what kind of risk he took for that action .
but maybe we should change the question .
maybe you 're familiar with this literature .
the leg is acting as a foot .
and look what it does with its foot to get over challenging terrain .
when you touched the cockroach leg -- can you get the microphone for him ?
so to our blueprint , we need to add tuned spines .
watch its feet .
watch what happens when the foot goes onto your sandwich .
very strange . how do they stick ?
it 's just an example of why we need to support curiosity-based research .
so these are tuned toes -- there are six of them , and they use the principles that i just talked about collectively for the blueprint .
and it was an arm that , instead of hinging and pivoting as it went across the record , went straight : a radial , linear tracking tone arm .
if the light bulb was the way the speaker is , and you couldn 't focus or sharpen the edges or define it , we wouldn 't have that , or movies in general , or computers , or t.v. sets , or c.d.s , or dvds -- and just go down the list of what the importance is of being able to focus light .
and we 're living in a great time right now , because almost everything 's being explored anew .
we 've been selling it since about last september , october , and it 's been immensely gratifying .
i said we can shorten the column , we can spread it out to cover the couch .
pain is 120 .
i 'm the happiest guy you 're ever going to meet .
and i rushed upstairs and started packing my suitcase .
they realized that using force against force doesn 't work .
i have a little mantra .
if we can put our anger inside an engine , it can drive us forward , it can get us through the dreadful moments and it can give us real inner power .
and they have to risk their lives almost every day to do this .
and this hasn 't just happened .
i borrow my friends ' children , so take all this advice with a grain of salt .
thing number one -- play with fire .
you lay down a couple of very simple rules -- always cut away from your body , keep the blade sharp , never force it -- and these are things kids can understand and practice with .
there are laws beyond safety regulations that attempt to limit how we can interact with the things that we own -- in this case , digital media .
about eight years ago , billy graham opened for me .
meanwhile , back at ted university , this wonderful woman is teaching you how to chop sun chips .
and rick is as a pagan god , which i thought was kind of appropriate , in a certain way .
very , very high resolution .
day four .
" free bird . "
[ korean ] to portuguese : aquecer-se global .
then we 're going to make an escalator that helps you get up there .
parenthetically , over there on the slopes , i did want to show you that black men ski .
we had an amazing childhood . we didn 't have any money , but we were outdoors most of the time .
i counted the number of bricks and now i 'm multiplying . "
what banged ? "
which is , what happens if these two , three-dimensional worlds should actually collide ?
that 's progress : when we prove things wrong .
here 's the number of people in higher education .
the area was kind of seedy , so we got an 80-room hotel for 100,000 dollars .
and then they 're up again at eight in the morning .
and i 'll just show you one .
shehu : and from there we will be able to , hopefully , make better predictions and then we compare it to the graph and also make some predictions .
aims is now a proven model .
because we want africa to be rich .
and throughout the book , there 's over an hour of documentary footage and interactive animations .
so that 's push pop press ' first title , al gore 's " our choice . "
but evolution is a balance : where you have fast change , you also have ultra-conservation -- things that almost never change .
every important machine 's got to have a big red button .
rhino 's the common cold , and you all know what polio is , and you can see that these signatures are distinct .
that 's me , getting a nasal lavage .
here 's another guy . you can play the diagnosis game yourself here .
we put the beeper in the clinic .
there 's an eight percent mortality rate with just doing this procedure , and so basically -- and what do they learn from it ?
ok , that 's one case report .
and this is a little phylogenetic tree to see how it 's related to other viruses .
less than a mile from here in this direction , in 1853 a scotsman filed his very first patent on the needle and syringe .
one is it could be holding back the next generation of vaccines in terms of their immune responses .
we 've talked about it being needle-free -- these are projections that you can 't even see -- and , of course , we get around the needle phobia issue as well .
but you can immediately see that the nanopatch achieves that penetration indeed .
suddenly we have a brand new lever in the world of vaccines .
that 's an important improvement .
thank you .
mira nair : in this little town , there were like 2,000 temples .
and i thought , " i 'm not going to be able to do that painting . "
and she said , " probably never . "
it 's more than a hundred years old and you can still see the fingermarks where the potter pinched it .
people do not enslave people to be mean to them .
they are not causal , they are actually supporting factors .
now , that kind of slavery is , again , pretty much what slavery has been all through human history .
d : interesting . micheal , bottom line , what do you recommend ?
one of their mothers said to us , " you know , we can 't survive here , but we can 't even seem to die either . "
buying people out of slavery is like paying a burglar to get your television back ; it 's abetting a crime .
dumped without political participation , decent education , any kind of real opportunity in terms of economic lives , and then sentenced to generations of violence and prejudice and discrimination .
i think there is enough intellectual power in this room to bring slavery to an end .
or -- and this is the fun part for me -- we want you to take us out into the natural world . we 'll come with a design challenge and we find the champion adapters in the natural world , who might inspire us .
why don 't they just keep on going ?
so the hardware is not at all up to snuff in terms of what life would call a success .
because life doesn 't really deal in things ; there are no things in the natural world divorced from their systems .
and so silicon , which we make right now -- it 's part of our carcinogenic problem in the manufacture of our chips -- this is a bio-mineralization process that 's now being mimicked .
power of shape : here 's a whale . we 've seen that the fins of this whale have tubercles on them . and those little bumps actually increase efficiency in , for instance , the edge of an airplane -- increase efficiency by about 32 percent .
this is a picture of the spinnerets coming out of a spider and the silk being formed from a spider . isn 't that beautiful ?
good luck having a conversation with them .
so , farming based on how a prairie builds soil , ranching based on how a native ungulate herd actually increases the health of the range , even wastewater treatment based on how a marsh not only cleans the water , but creates incredibly sparkling productivity .
and yet i think it 's this perspective of us as humans to look at our world through the lens of normal is one of the forces that stops us developing real solutions .
one of the things about working at the nanoscale is things look and act very differently .
what if we combined it with this ?
when we run out of water , as we are in some parts of the world and soon to be in other parts of the world , we 're going to have to get this from the sea , and that 's going to require us to build desalination plants .
there 's something much more interesting around the corner , " i say , " try saying that to her . "
and here we 've been on this journey , and the truth is , it 's been thrilling .
and we started , and for the next 53 hours , it was an intense , unforgettable life experience .
it 's just -- so , uh , wooo .
and so there won 't be another epic journey in the ocean .
bonnie , where are you ?
it needed a context , a culture , a community of other vaginas .
vagina , vagina , vagina . it doesn 't matter how many times you say the word , it never sounds like a word you want to say .
i think before i did the " vagina monologues " i didn 't really believe in happiness .
that 's essentially a gender ; that 's essentially a resource of the planet , which is women .
and i really love hearing about all these species at the bottom of the sea .
he almost murdered me . i left and you can too . "
and always as a child i had this fantasy that somebody would come and rescue me .
and i had friends who were really good kids , who lived out the dr. jekyll mr. hyde scenario -- robert louis stevenson .
so , this arc of the cosmic transformation of god 's favorite angel into the devil , for me , sets the context for understanding human beings who are transformed from good , ordinary people into perpetrators of evil .
and what i 've done is i organized them into various categories .
so how do psychologists go about understanding such transformations of human character , if you believe that they were good soldiers before they went down to that dungeon ?
and it has a lot of detail about what i 'm going to talk about today .
he gets tied up to the shock apparatus in another room .
two thirds go all the way to 450 volts . this was just one study .
so on day one , we knew we had good apples .
they begin to do degrading activities , like having them simulate sodomy .
dehumanization of others . de-individuation of self .
so you need a paradigm shift in all of these areas .
he was a low-level private , and that stopped it . was he a hero ? no .
b : you have to act socio-centrically , not egocentrically .
path three , you become a hero .
that 's the kind of power we have because of all of the data that we have .
but it brings me back .
collect his data .
in other words , it 's kind of random , kind of ad hoc , how we figure out what we should do .
take a number , any number -- two .
if you think that way , you have a platonist moral framework .
it 's just a matter of the consequences .
it 's not a matter of calculation .
not only can we think , we must .
go find a friend and explain to them how you made that decision .
now it 's also a beautiful opera , and we 're moved by that opera .
i 'm surrounded by genius . i cannot help but remember the organisms and the ecosystems that know how to live here gracefully on this planet .
and most people knock them down when they 're small .
they have asked themselves , " what if , every time i started to invent something , i asked , ' how would nature solve this ? ' " and here is what they 're learning .
so how does it keep its body free of bacteria build-up ?
they 've borrowed the recipe from the coral reef , and they 're using co2 as a building block in cement , in concrete .
a company called aquaporin is starting to make desalination membranes mimicking this technology .
but then right after that , they emit a protein that actually gathers and aggregates those nanoparticles so that they fall out of solution .
mit just has a new radio chip that uses far less power than our chips .
and we 're working with eol , encyclopedia of life , ed wilson 's ted wish .
people with spinal cord injuries , like paraplegias , quadriplegias , will often develop a very , very sensitive area right above the level of their injury , wherever that is .
she said , " no . honestly when i get home i 'm usually too tired . "
you know ? you can get cadavers if you work at a university . "
it was called the " upsuck " theory .
i have an answer for you . i have two answers .
now here we go in to the -- la la la , off to work .
and i also said to her , " now these sows . i mean , you may have noticed there , the sow doesn 't look to be in the throes of ecstasy . "
doctor kinsey had heard -- and there was a theory kind of going around at the time , this being the 1940s -- that the force with which semen is thrown against the cervix was a factor in fertility .
i mean , we need a whole conference just devoted to telling the good stories about the continent .
you know , someone would come in with a list of the people who haven 't paid school fees , and when they started getting pretty strict , you had to leave , until your school fees could be paid .
final story , and i sort of have to speak quickly .
at that time , there was only one bank that had atms in kenya , and we could not get cash . the family couldn 't get cash for him to start the treatment until monday .
he was like , i try and i make .
where are the rest of the swahili speakers ?
but there is such a need , you know ?
we talk about african governments like they 've been dropped from mars , you know ?
i was paying her school fees .
like , that 's the dumbest reason i 've ever heard for applying to law school .
usually i like working in my shop , but when it 's raining and the driveway outside turns into a river , then i just love it .
" connected " is a collaboration with choreographer gideon obarzanek .
thanks .
on the 30th of may , 1832 , a gunshot was heard ringing out across the 13th arrondissement in paris .
what crystals are possible , we can understand through the mathematics of symmetry .
he has a character describing the snowflake , and he says he " shuddered at its perfect precision , found it deathly , the very marrow of death . "
but it 's on the walls where all the exciting things are happening .
so , let 's take these two symmetrical objects here .
i can reflect it in the line through x , or the line through y , or the line through z.
so the little table here records how the algebra of these symmetries work .
now , galois produced some laws for how these tables -- how symmetries interact .
and we find the same symmetries here , and the same interaction .
now , this new symmetrical object does not have a name yet .
how many digits are there in your number ?
and i will always come back to this quote from the japanese " essays in idleness " : " in everything , uniformity is undesirable .
what could be more glamorous than understanding the entire universe , grand unification ? and , by the way , it helps if you 're brian greene -- he has other kinds of glamour .
there were scores of retouchers and lighting experts and make-up experts .
and i don 't know who she is either , but this is the [ 16th ] century equivalent of a supermodel .
and this is one reason that modes of transportation tend to be extremely glamorous .
it makes things look effortless .
part of the thing is that , in " rear window , " the question is , is she too glamorous to live in his world ?
this is an interior design firm that is literally called utopia .
but actually , what 's even more important than remembering what 's been edited out is thinking , are the ideals good ?
it 's not necessarily glamorous , but unveiling the glamour has an appeal .
and what the missionaries would do is , they 'd walk around and they 'd pick up hyena shit .
they went down like elevators ; we got on them . they went back up , and the bedouin -- each bedouin , four of them -- got behind each of the camels with a little whip .
so , i got a national geographic film crew . we went down there , and i took one look at this camel .
so not only do they have the very long eyelashes , but there 's the secondary -- i guess you 'd call it the [ unclear ] or whatever .
we weigh our animals .
but on this particular occasion , it was very , very clear that as horny as suki was , jasmine was having none of it .
short fur that keeps my skin cool .
no surprise .
please , also on the balcony .
so , cooking is a very important technology , because it allowed us to acquire what brought you all here : the big brain , this wonderful cerebral cortex we have .
take something which looks like food , transform it , and it gives you a good , very easy , accessible energy .
but of course , they are hard-wired but we use them still in a sophisticated way .
and within this structure , you see these two pinkish layers , which are actually the muscle .
what it means is that we have a layered control system .
we have learned to talk to the big brain -- taste and reward , as you know .
so i would say , coquo ergo sum : i cook , therefore i am .
a couple of things to keep in mind when you see it , it was built entirely by hand , i think they got a crane the last year .
and you know , when i knew him when i was in the office , he would come in from a trip , and he would be in the office for two or three days intensely , and he would pack up and go .
nk : thank you .
but i think he has given us this building and we feel all the time for him , that 's why , he has given love for us .
so i started researching , and to my surprise , this project had never been done before in the arts or the sciences .
and then this back down on the ground and you can see that the fungus is actually invading this tree .
i spoke to the biologist who discovered this tree , and he told me that that spindly growth you see there in the center is most likely a product of climate change .
they contain thousands of years of their own histories within themselves , and they also contain records of natural and human events .

and fortunately i decided in 2008 to return to ghana , after 28 years of absence .

and here we have a very prime example of the iconic dodo , which comes from mauritius , and , of course , we know is now a symbol of extinction .
now , our preliminary labwork on the leaf extract has shown that precisely these leaves contain ingredients that are very close , in terms of structures , chemical structures , to those medicines which are sold in the chemist 's shop against asthma .
the seeds give an oil , a very stable oil which is sought after by the cosmetic industry to give to produce body lotions , for example .

one of the things that we 've developed in the lab -- we 've developed several vehicles -- is what we believe is the world 's first autonomously drifting car .

ok , i call the spca to confirm this -- they confirm it .
he snips it , throws the tip over his shoulder , and then grabs the scrotum and pushes it upward , and then his head dips down , obscuring my view , but what i hear is a slurping sound , and a noise that sounds like velcro being yanked off a sticky wall and i am not even kidding .

jesse came to us at the ric to be fit with these state-of-the-art devices , and here you see them .
on the left-hand side , you see his original prosthesis , and he 's using those switches to move little blocks from one box to the other .
so one of the best parts of my job is working with really great patients who are also our research collaborators .
i could work them just by my thoughts .
see .
so now it 's able to train with just this little piece on the back .
tk : all right . so that 's exciting on where we may go with the better mechatronics , if we make them good enough to put out on the market and use in a field trial .
this arm -- they 're always made for the 50th percentile male -- which means they 're too big for five-eighths of the world .
i must admit , i used to be one of them .
then they irradiate our food , trying to make it last longer , so it can travel thousands of miles from where it 's grown to the supermarkets .
i want you to know that me , my brother and sister actually like eating baked kale chips .
so , contrary to popular belief , there is not a conflict of interest between empiricism and values .
who are my friends ? " ; to exercise the love of social complexity and the narrative intelligence that drives most of their play behavior ; and which embeds in it values about noticing that we have lots of choices in our lives and the ways that we conduct ourselves .
girl 3 : this is my pretend [ unclear ] one .
nakilia invited reuben too , but -- rockett : but what ? isn 't he coming ?
we love them .
i realized i 'd internalized these responses and it had changed who i was on a core level .
for me , this means that they 're seeing the value of difference , the joy it brings when instead of focusing on loss or limitation , we see and discover the power and joy of seeing the world from exciting new perspectives .
and four children have just died .
lifesaver pores are 15 nanometers .
so we 're just going to put that in there as well .
let 's see chris 's program throughout the rest of the show . okay ?
instead of shipping water , and using man-made processes to do it , let 's use mother nature . she 's got a fantastic system .
under a tree she saw a woman meditating furiously .
may he be called to wash away his sins . "
and that is the astonishing power of art .
and i thought , " this is what we need , as a language . "
[ video ] then get me one of those fancy water purifiers .
so this is the cotton sari .
and as for outsiders , white , black or brown , tar and feather them , and whip them out of town .
and there are stand-up comics who are talking about racial issues , about ethnic issues .
but the king had an idea .
so , what i 'd like to talk about is something that was very dear to kahn 's heart , which is : how do we discover what is really particular about a project ?
and this gave birth to the idea of having toroidal generating geometry , one with its center deep in the earth for the landside building and a toroid with its center in the sky for the island building .
this voice does not repeat for six months .
and the structures rise from the sand cliffs -- they 're built in concrete and sandstones ; the roofs are stainless steel -- they are facing south and reflecting light towards the temple itself , pedestrians crisscross from one side to the other .
this is actually a spanish quarry , which sort of inspired the kind of spaces that these galleries could be .
beauty in the most profound sense of fit .
you 've read about it already .
well , the internet has empowered us .
they are shaping our very desires .
now you see me thinking at my kitchen table , and since you 're in my kitchen , please meet my wife .
they are believed to have magical powers .
and i didn 't ask them to do nice cartoons .
they decide what is too offensive or too provocative for you to see .
most of the reefs are dead , most of the corals are dead -- overgrown by algae -- and most of the fish are smaller than the pencils we use to count them .
and then we have a lower biomass of carnivores , and a lower biomass of top head , or the sharks , the large snappers , the large groupers .
then you go to palmyra atoll that has more biomass of herbivores , and the dead corals are clean , and the corals are coming back .
these places , when we protect them , if we compare them to unprotected areas nearby , this is what happens .
so what we have now -- or a world without reserves -- is like a debit account where we withdraw all the time and we never make any deposit .
so how much of this do we have ?
well , there are three main reasons why we don 't have tens of thousands of small reserves : the first one is that people have no idea what marine reserves do , and fishermen tend to be really , really defensive when it comes to regulating or closing an area , even if it 's small .
first of all , your pyramid , your inverted pyramid , showing 85 percent biomass in the predators , that seems impossible .
it would only cost 16 billion to set up 20 percent of the ocean as marine protected areas that actually give new living choices to the fishermen as well .
if any of the more rowdier children questioned the authority of the parents , they were scolded .
the transparency law they 'd passed earlier that applied to everybody else , they tried to keep it so it didn 't apply to them .
in the finance industry , you now have more of a right to know about what 's going on , so we have different anti-bribery laws , money regulations , increased corporate disclosure , so you can now track assets across borders .
so this is a website that tries to agglomerate all of those databases into one place so you can start searching for , you know , his relatives , his friends , the head of his security services .
is that radical openness ? i say it 's not , because for me , what it means , it doesn 't mean abdicating power , responsibility , accountability , it 's actually being a partner with power . it 's about sharing responsibility , sharing accountability . also , the fact that he threatened to sue me because i got a leak of his leaks , i thought that showed a remarkable sort of inconsistency in ideology , to be honest , as well .
well , i 'm sorry , people , but we are back to the pre-enlightenment church , and we need to fight against that .
so there 's all of this complexity in our natural systems , but they 're extremely efficient , far more efficient than anything we can build , far more complex than anything we can build .
and i think it really brings to light : is this really scalable ?
if you have errors , you can replace a part .
so it 's exciting potential for this .
what you may not realize is just how prevalent it is .
fifty percent will have onset by age 14 , 75 percent by age 24 , a picture that is very different than what one would see if you 're talking about cancer or heart disease , diabetes , hypertension -- most of the major illnesses that we think about as being sources of morbidity and mortality .
in a sense , it actually makes you feel that when you 're in the safe zone of studying behavior or cognition , something you can observe , that in a way feels more simplistic and reductionistic than trying to engage this very complex , mysterious organ that we 're beginning to try to understand .
the good-news stories in medicine are early detection , early intervention .
and the importance of that is that we have a platform to build on .
62 percent of our population is below the age of 24 .
creating our own program to solve problems , like fighting corruption , building institutions , stabilizing the micro economy .
the issue is not that .
he was in the army .
in about two to three hours , she started to move .
you know , we have to use it well .
but i fear -- and i 'm very grateful to all of them for what they are trying to do on the continent -- but i 'm also worried . i wake up with a gnawing in my belly because i see a new set of aid entrepreneurs on the continent .
our inability to take charge and say to all these people bringing their money , " sit down . "
don 't be shy of it .
one idea .
she will create another 100 , 200 more jobs .
because old and ancient as it may be , it 's very complicated and it 's very simple , both at the same time .
so the eye , after a while , can distinguish these two very well .
if you take this thing , you know very well it weighs very little .
and the only part which is natural is a number , the roughness of the cloud , which is taken from nature .
i used them for describing some of the aspects of the complexity of nature .
and amazing .
where are real price increments ?
my uncle was a very prominent mathematician , and he told me , " look , there 's a problem which i could not solve 25 years ago , and which nobody can solve .
and then this one .
therefore , it must be good for the environment .
and the thing is that we have to find ways if we 're actually going to address sustainability of interlocking those complex systems and making better choices that result in net environmental gains .
those same molecules , they become methane , and methane is a 25 times more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide .
and i blame it on the refrigerator , well , especially in western cultures , because it makes it easier .
we 've had to clear land .
or , " how do i make it green materials ?
so imagine if you designed kettles , you actually found a way to solve these system failures , because this is a huge amount of pressure on the system , just because the product hasn 't thought about the problem that it 's going to have when it exists in the world .
and because we don 't see the ramifications of the choices that we make as designers , as businesspeople , as consumers , then these kinds of externalities happen , and these are people 's lives .
and i 'll just leave you with one very quick thing that a designer said to me recently who i work with , a senior designer .
all right , so it 's a delicate dance .
it listens to the lecture , and then it uses the amplitude of each word to move a point on the x-axis , and it uses the inflection of sentences to move a same point up and down on the y-axis .
so watch closely and see what your eyes can hear .
the world bank projects by 2011 , it will be under 20 million , which is a reduction of 95 percent .
the genome project was a controversial project in 1990 .
so homo sapiens , the first technology-creating species , the species that combined a cognitive function with an opposable appendage -- and by the way , chimpanzees don 't really have a very good opposable thumb -- so we could actually manipulate our environment with a power grip and fine motor coordination , and use our mental models to actually change the world and bring on technology .
they were shrinking vacuum tubes , making them smaller and smaller .
as we make them smaller and less expensive , the electrons have less distance to travel .
that was in the interests of the species tens of thousands of years ago .
these are some designs from eric drexler 's book -- which we 're now showing are feasible with super-computing simulations , where actually there are scientists building molecule-scale robots .
where will we get the software ?
they 'll be so small , they 'll be embedded in our clothing , in our environment .
my main message is that progress in technology is exponential , not linear .
he had a good laugh at the other teachers and put it up on the notice board .
and mad and crazy and fun .
anyway , the next slide i 'm about to show you -- should i just turn that off ?
so , i tried going to the art store .
and i sat like you guys there in the audience .
and he said , " oh , it 's very easy . i can teach you , but we 're leaving the city , because billboard painters are a dying , extinct bunch of artists , because digital printing has totally replaced them and hijacked them . "
so netra was stuck with 30 paintings of mine .
we were in the papers , we 're still in the news three years later , but , unfortunately , something tragic happened right after .
at this point , something else happened .
and two magical things happened after he was born .
i was in australia , and belinda had cancer , and i was told she 's not going to live very long .
well , we can use disaster response as an opportunity for service for the veterans coming home .
every day he leaves the wire with a mission .
he doesn 't have that same self-worth .
i broke some bones in my feet .
they said to my parents , the neck break was a stable fracture , but the back was completely crushed .
and the question i asked myself is , if i couldn 't do that , then who was i ?
i felt so incredibly grateful for my life .
and then i remembered my friends that were still in the spinal ward , particularly maria .
sitting at home in my wheelchair and my plaster body cast , an airplane flew overhead , and i looked up , and i thought to myself , " that 's it !
i 'm going , " wow , how do you ever know what all these buttons and dials do ? "
but at least she always knew where i was .
the pilot light inside of me was still a light , just as it is in each and every one of us .
this country over here is china . this is india .
the africans are the green down here . they still remain here .
and on top of that , we can put east europe , we can put east asia , and we put south asia . and how did it look like if we go back in time , to about 1970 ? then there was more of a hump .
not as the myth is . and that includes all the children of the foreign workers who are in the country .
so we 've got a much more mainstream appearance of the world , where all countries tend to use their money better than they used in the past . now , this is , more or less , if you look at the average data of the countries -- they are like this .
i 've done anthropology on the main statistical units . everyone says , " it 's impossible . this can 't be done . our information is so peculiar in detail , so that cannot be searched as others can be searched .
and the thing would be to get up the databases free , to get them searchable , and with a second click , to get them into the graphic formats , where you can instantly understand them .
but for us , i want to talk about three factors today .
and i believe that the decades ahead of us now will be to a greater or lesser extent turbulent the more or less we are able to achieve that aim : to bring governance to the global space .
well it seems to me that we 're now seeing a fundamental shift of power , broadly speaking , away from nations gathered around the atlantic [ seaboard ] to the nations gathered around the pacific rim .
now notice , in a period which is dominated by a mono-polar world , you have fixed alliances -- nato , the warsaw pact .
oh yes ? why not ?
we are all now deeply , deeply , deeply interconnected .
if it is the case , ladies and gentlemen -- and it is -- that we are now locked together in a way that has never been quite the same before , then it 's also the case that we share a destiny with each other .
but unlike the other speakers , i 'm not going to tell you about the mysteries of the universe , or the wonders of evolution , or the really clever , innovative ways people are attacking the major inequalities in our world .
and it 's something i 've never really found a good way of doing .
here 's one -- a head , followed by a tail , followed by a tail .
and i don 't want to end up in the two-minute silence to give you more time to think about it , until everyone 's expressed a view . ok .
on this side -- remember , you 're excited about head-tail-tail ; you 're excited about head-tail-head .
it 's a very , very simple example , an easily stated question in probability , which every -- you 're in good company -- everybody gets wrong .
the most pressing one is that we want to understand how some differences make some people susceptible to one disease -- type-2 diabetes , for example -- and other differences make people more susceptible to heart disease , or stroke , or autism and so on .
well , you 're right to be a bit skeptical , because that 's not the answer .
one explanation is that the person doesn 't have the disease -- that 's overwhelmingly likely , if you pick someone at random -- but the test gets it wrong , which is unlikely .
so he said , " here , i 'll assume that these events are independent .
there are two things involved -- two parts to the explanation .
well , we know that randomness and uncertainty and chance are very much a part of our everyday life .
forensic scientists said , " the chance that this guy 's innocent is one in three million . "
they 're the dominant builders and to a large extent , the dominant designers .
so , this is an astounding table .
because the problem is , when you have advanced cancer , we can 't do that much today about it , as the statistics allude to .
you know , in the mid-1850 's in france , they started to describe cancer by body part .
if we could even take it one step further and prevent disease , we can take it enormously the other direction , and obviously , that 's where we need to go , going forward .
people got upset , but this is the only way we 're going to go forward .
so , the states , are equivalent classes of history , and the cancer patient , the input , is the environment , the diet , the treatment , the genetic mutations .
it 's never been shown .
so , this picture , although it is beautiful , is a 40-gigabyte picture of the whole proteome .
ten percent of people in the trial had this dramatic response that was shown here , and the drug went to the fda , and the fda said , " without a placebo , how do i know patients actually benefited from the drug ? "
the way we 've approached it is the field of proteomics , again , this looking at the system .
and so , i implore everyone here : think differently . come up with new ideas .
how do we self-identify and how mutable is that identity ?
that means she takes the credit and then makes us come out here and do all the work .
you 're all so responsible for this world that we live in today .
the point is , i 'm happy somebody has practical ideas to get us out of this mess .
so then i 'm like , should i be nervous , you know , because maybe it 's better .
so , but i think whether you own your own company or you 're just starting out like me , like something like this is so vital for people to just continue expanding their minds and learning .
but [ german ] .
good evening .
and then at college , it 's like she never came home .
i am originally from jordan .
that 's all , shukran . thank you very much for the opportunity .
and it 's a very effective way of ending your hate mail : " love markham , aged 4 . " still works .
so by the time i 'm finished talking here , there 'll be 864 more hours of video on youtube than there were when i started , and two and a half million more photos on facebook and instagram than when i started .
it 's like the de facto real-time newswire , if you know how to use it , because there is so much on twitter .
markham nolan : okay , so now if you 're a news producer , this is something you 'd love to run with , because obviously , this is gold .
and what this video shows , when you watch the whole thing through , is bloody bodies being taken out of a pickup truck and thrown off a bridge .
the bridge looks like it 's crossing the river east to west .
embracing otherness .
and how many times would my self have to die before i realized that it was never alive in the first place ?
another world was opening up around this time : performance and dancing .
in other words , race has no basis in biological or scientific fact .
it happens when i dance , when i 'm acting .
and if you can do that , incredible things happen .
therefore every moment really is the most important moment that 's ever happened , including this moment right now .
and for many years afterwards , i would have a desperate desire to taste ginger beer .
my mother sent yams and rice , and our old clothes , to his family .
never mind that i knew nothing about places like namibia .
a few years ago , i visited mexico from the u.s.
now , obviously i said this in a fit of mild irritation .
the consequence of the single story is this : it robs people of dignity .
what if my roommate knew about nollywood , full of innovative people making films despite great technical odds , films so popular that they really are the best example of nigerians consuming what they produce ?
the other said , " how much did we hire him for ? "
so i 've got to get there and be in complete panic .
" you 're a great actor , and i like to give to my actors -- why don 't you show me what you want to do ? "
and he said , " son , it goes on forever . "
so that 's as wide as we look at stories .
just talk about plot and say how wonderful you 'll shoot the film , what the visuals will be . "
but i said , " but the storm won the armada .
are you with child ?
bess : as you wish , majesty .
what 's the process of telling a story ?
it says that the rich are always sitting on the shoulders and survive on the shoulders of the poor .
in a storyteller 's mind , it 's a contradiction of moralities .
it is the hot topic .
so the genome really tells you much more about predisposition .
now of course , in medical application , that is very useful because it 's the same kind of information that the doctor gets from your family medical history -- except probably , your genome knows much more about your medical history than you do .
and applied minds gets a lot of calls from people who want help with their problems , and i didn 't think this was a very likely one to call back , so i kept on giving him to the delay list .
and so this picture , which looks like a big smudge to you , is actually the thing that got me really thrilled about this and made me feel like we were on the right track .
but i think this is actually just the beginning of how we 're going to treat cancer .
and then we do a clinical trial for a drug for lung cancer and one for prostate cancer and one for breast cancer , and we treat these as if they 're separate diseases and that this way of dividing them had something to do with what actually went wrong .
so what we need is to have a causative model of what 's actually going on , and proteomics actually gives us the ability to build a model like that .
it 's going to require a lot of work , a lot of research .
but it didn 't -- it never occurred to me that it had to be invented and that it had been invented only 350 years ago .
he said -- he called what he 'd done as making -- they didn 't call it a vacuum pump at the time .
something was missing , you know . i mean , these are -- it 's kind of weird to think that someone had to do an experiment to show that , but that was what was going on at the time .
and so you can start making up some rules .
it was 300,000 , probably , years ago that most of us , the ancestors of most of us in this room came up out of africa and turned to the left .
at any rate , when i was a boy , i , like , for instance , i had this -- i got this little book from fort sill , oklahoma -- this is about the time that george dyson 's dad was starting to blow nuclear -- thinking about blowing up nuclear rockets and stuff .
and so i -- i did some experiments .
we should have been , because it made a lot of smoke and it made a lot of noise , and it was powerful , you know .
i mean , you can 't make up results , and then do another experiment based on that one .
that 's back when travel was easy .
so -- and arrhenius ' theory -- and all the global warmers think -- they would say , yeah , it should go up in the daytime , too , if it 's the greenhouse effect .
you know , if they said , you know what ?
we see the same people over and over again , but that 's because we 're not really exploring the full depth and breadth of the city .
how cool is that ?
which battle do you think is harder ?
it all hit me .
what happened next , of course ?
he claims it 's done based on a unesco study .
" manal al-sharif withdraws from the campaign . "
the first thing , i got out of jail , of course after i took a shower , i went online , i opened my twitter account and my facebook page , and i 've been always very respectful to those people who are opining to me .
but all i know , and all i 'm sure of , in the future when someone asks me my story , i will say , " i 'm proud to be amongst those women who lifted the ban , fought the ban , and celebrated everyone 's freedom . "
but as a fine-art photographer i somehow felt that it wouldn 't catch on out there , that there would be a problem with trying to make this as a fine-art career .
but we 've become totally disconnected from them .
these images of bangladesh came out of a radio program i was listening to .
and what was also one of the bigger projects around that was moving 13 full-size cities up out of the reservoir , and flattening all the buildings so they could make way for the ships .
this is the town hall for the city .
there 's two factories of this scale in the same town .
so that gives you an idea of the kinds of migrations and the speed with which -- this is just the taxis being built by volkswagen .
this is going to show you , real time , an assembler . it 's a circuit breaker .
and i started getting in further and further into the factories .
these are just recently shot -- i just came back about a month ago , so you 're the first ones to be seeing these , these new factory pictures i 've taken .
and as much as there are great things around the corner -- and it 's palpable in this room -- of all of the things that are just about to break that can solve so many problems , i 'm really hoping that those things will spread around the world and will start to have a positive effect .
and so in this case , because it 's about a lot of these images and what they represent , and the kinds of questions they bring up , that we thought letting the images play out and bring someone to say , " well , what 's worldchanging.com , with these images , have to do ? "
and they 're going to push that up , from the bottom -- up into , i believe , into the households . and parents will be reacting to it , and trying to help them with the projects .
we go from the trench warfare of the first world war to the maginot line of the second world war , and then we go into the cold war , the iron curtain , the berlin wall .
this is an attack on the global commons .
and let 's pull it together in afghanistan today .
eighty-five percent cannot read when they enter the security forces of afghanistan .
to give you one example of the impact this can have , this little boy , eight years old , walked with his mother two days to come to the eye clinic put on by the comfort .
we talked earlier about the arab spring , and the power of all this .
i would argue life is a rheostat .
now a fourth factor really becomes an obsession , which is , never betray the illusion .
and so when i moved to new york city after college and got completely sucker-punched in the face by depression , i did the only thing i could think of at the time .
the mere fact that somebody would even just sit down , pull out a piece of paper and think about someone the whole way through , with an intention that is so much harder to unearth when the browser is up and the iphone is pinging and we 've got six conversations rolling in at once , that is an art form that does not fall down to the goliath of " get faster , " no matter how many social networks we might join .
i feel that there 's a massive and bizarre idea going around that we have to bring more computers into schools .
change is happening , and the change that is happening is not one that is in software .
that was a month of my life .
in the background , my bicycle .
not just showing up every now and then .
and i 'm all set to do it . i 'm all set to do it , but then it turns out that to set up here , you have like 10 minutes to set up !
the slinky moves . we 're going through different nodes of the wave , coming out this way .
there 's a riot going on on campus , and the police are chasing me , right ?
i 'm thinking of lorenz contractions and einsteinian relativity .
and you would think , would you not , that with all our science , with all our advances in society , with better towns , better civilizations , better sanitation , wealth , that we would get better at controlling mosquitos , and hence reduce this disease .
but it 's not one virus , it 's four , and the same protection that gives you the antibodies and protects you from the same virus that you had before actually makes you much more susceptible to the other three .
the first way is that you use larvicides .
we don 't want to do anything that you can 't undo .
a single female will lay about up to 100 eggs at a time , up to about 500 in her lifetime .
we can produce them , in a space a bit more than this red carpet , i can produce about 20 million a week .
but whereas a g.m. crop is trying to protect the plant , for example , and give it an advantage , what we 're actually doing is taking the mosquito and giving it the biggest disadvantage it can possibly have , rendering it unable to reproduce effectively .
your brains are about 100 million times more complicated .
galvani 's approach of probing the nervous system with electrodes has remained state-of-the-art until today , despite a number of drawbacks .
this is because , although each cell in our bodies contains the same set of genes , different mixes of genes get turned on and off in different cells .
since we took these first steps , the field of optogenetics has exploded .
and the logic of our experiment was simple .
we know from our formal model that the brain structure at the receiving end of the critic 's commentary is the actor .
come to think of it , knowing when you 're wrong without a teacher , or your mother , telling you , is a very hard problem .
it depends what the answer is though .
now , you use the virgin brand a lot and it seems like you 're getting synergy from one thing to the other .
so , just help us with some of the numbers .
rb : i know , i have -- the lawyers say you mustn 't do things like that , but -- i mean , speaking of which , tell us about -- rb : " pammy " we launched , you know -- mistakenly thought we could take on coca-cola , and we launched a cola bottle called " the pammy " and it was shaped a bit like pamela anderson .
and then 24 months from now , people will be able to take a ride into space .
and so , just the initial lift off from sugarloaf to cross the atlantic , as we were pushing into the jet stream , this enormous balloon -- the top of the balloon ended up going at a couple of hundred miles an hour , the capsule that we were in at the bottom was going at maybe two miles an hour , and it just took off .
your companies have had incredible pr value out of these heroics .
but just to clarify , the 25 billion dollars is gross , right ? that 's gross ?
rb : no , i think if you 're bringing up kids , you just want to smother them with love and praise and enthusiasm .
and he went , " furthermore , i 'm a priest myself . "
how do your family feel about each time you step into something big and new ?
so , for instance , there 's a doctor in africa that 's found that if you give a mother antiretroviral drugs at 24 weeks , when she 's pregnant , that the baby will not have hiv when it 's born .
50s , 60s , the mode of operation shifts more to the quest for wisdom and a search for legacy .
but the rest of us know that the internet can be a really ugly place .
we are the new editors .
clicking on a train wreck just pours gasoline on it .
but if instead we have the guts to confuse our students , perplex them , and evoke real questions , through those questions , we as teachers have information that we can use to tailor robust and informed methods of blended instruction .
as if what we are doing one day will save lives .
and yet it 's made from parts that are invisible , or near-invisible , to the naked eye : bacteria and grains of sand .
just south of the sahara we find the sahel .
so , they moved the entire village , hut by hut .
sand dunes are almost like ready-made buildings in a way .
the first is to create a kind of balloon structure , fill it with bacteria , then allow the sand to wash over the balloon , pop the balloon , as it were , disseminating the bacteria into the sand and solidifying it .
in a period of unprecedented population growth and increased food demands , this could prove disastrous .
and i said , i 've got powerpoint . let 's do a venn diagram .
and she was like , " why ? "
kids can get there a lot more easily than adults can , and that 's why i love writing for kids .
so i ran the 826 in los angeles , and it was my job to build the store down there .
and viking odorant , which comes in lots of great scents : toenails , sweat and rotten vegetables , pyre ash .
and so i try to do this in my books .
so this is randolph , and randolph belongs to a kid named nico who was one of the first kids to ever call in , and i 'll play you some of nico 's message .
i feel lucky . kids like nico are the best readers , and they deserve the best stories we can give them .
in short , there was a lot of water and there weren 't very many people .
well , it 's a national problem , but i 'm going to tell you another story from montana , and it involves beer .
we pay them to leave their water in-stream .
and when we make these connections , we can and we do turn this into this .
[ " two explorers just completed a polar expedition that killed everyone the last time it was attempted " ] chris hadfield talked so eloquently about fear and about the odds of success , and indeed the odds of survival .
unlike scott 's expedition , there were just two of us , and we set off from the coast of antarctica in october last year , dragging everything ourselves , a process scott called " man-hauling . "
it 's 110 miles long ; most of its surface is what 's called blue ice .
as a result , we both became increasingly hypoglycemic — we had low blood sugar levels day after day — and increasingly susceptible to the extreme cold .
on the way back down to the coast , our crampons — they 're the spikes on our boots that we have for traveling over this blue ice on the glacier — broke on the top of the beardmore .
if i 'm honest , antarctica challenged me and humbled me so deeply that i 'm not sure i 'll ever be able to put it into words .
it shows these women playing with these toys .
origami revolves around crease patterns .
and if you want to go really crazy , 1,000 scales on a rattlesnake .
but we 're going to start small .
what if i want to make something that has a lot of flaps ?
or , really , any other kind of deer .
but i want to show you some examples .
there were two groups of people who were interested in this : planetary scientists , who want to look up , and then other people , who wanted to look down .
this is a heart stent developed by zhong you at oxford university .
i 'm a psychologist , but rest assured , i will not bring it to the scrotal .
i was doing my taxes the other day , and i got to the point where i was listing all of the donations i gave , and i had an epiphany , it was -- i came to my check to the seva foundation and i noticed that i thought , boy , my friend larry brilliant would really be happy that i gave money to seva .
and before he was arrested , he had murdered his grandparents , his mother and five co-eds at uc santa cruz .
there 's a wonderful book called stuff : the hidden life of everyday objects .
and we found out that he was hispanic , he didn 't speak any english , he had no money , he 'd been wandering the streets for days , starving , and he 'd fainted from hunger .
and as you can see , it 's about eight inches in diameter .
so as a result , the angular acceleration , denoted by greek letter alpha here , goes as one over r.
so robots like this could be sent into collapsed buildings to assess the damage after natural disasters , or sent into reactor buildings to map radiation levels .
and here you 'll see daniel throw this hoop into the air , while the robot is calculating the position of the hoop and trying to figure out how to best go through the hoop .
so when we have a robot which is surrounded by neighbors -- and let 's look at robot i and robot j -- what we want the robots to do is to monitor the separation between them as they fly in formation .
one of the disadvantages of doing that is , as you scale things up -- so if you have lots of robots carrying the same thing , you 're essentially effectively increasing the inertia , and therefore you pay a price ; they 're not as agile .
it figures out where it is with respect to the features and then estimates its position 100 times a second allowing us to use the control algorithms that i described to you earlier .
the second thing i want to do is introduce my co-author and dear friend and co-teacher .
or -- or maybe and -- in addition to rules , let 's see if we can come up with some really clever incentives so that , even if the people we deal with don 't particularly want to serve our interests , it is in their interest to serve our interest -- the magic incentives that will get people to do the right thing even out of pure selfishness .
and in particular , the virtue that we need most of all is the virtue that aristotle called " practical wisdom . "
and most important , a wise person does this improvising and rule-bending in the service of the right aims .
he was a responsible husband and father .
now consider ms. dewey .
that is to say , it creates people who only do things for incentives .
one in particular is a judge named robert russell .
there are now 22 cities that have veterans ' courts like this .
and in order to be an effective doctor , you need to treat people who have lives and not just disease .
thanks .
einstein said space is nice and flat , if there 's no matter present .
einstein had already used up space and time , warps and curves , to describe gravity .
it 's very hard to see it , though , from far away .
well , it 's a theory that tries to answer the question : what are the basic , fundamental , indivisible , uncuttable constituents making up everything in the world around us ?
and there you see unification , because matter particles , electrons and quarks , radiation particles , photons , gravitons , are all built up from one entity .
this is a deep question .
and if the answer that we get from our calculations agrees with the values of those numbers that have been determined through detailed and precise experimentation , this in many ways would be the first fundamental explanation for why the structure of the universe is the way it is .
and now string theory comes along and says , yes , gravity , quantum mechanics , electromagnetism , all together in one package , but only if the universe has more dimensions than the ones that we see .
to give you a sense of the experience , the article was called , " i think you 're fat . "
the first thing i did was i got a stack of bibles .
that one i followed by default , by not getting in a fight with a man whose wife was standing nearby , looking like she had a strong grip .
i wanted to see how dressing biblically affected my mind .
well , that 's another . i did spend some time shepherding .
it 's a remarkable thing .
they have a pamphlet that says , " here 's what jesus said about homosexuality , " and you open it up , and there 's nothing in it .
the key is to pick and choose the right parts .
and by 1980 , the last train rode .
so far it 's cost about 150 million .
and we 've already started construction on section two .
i like to call it the global shadow economy , or mcmafia , for short .
now in bulgaria -- this photograph was taken in bulgaria -- when communism collapsed all over eastern europe , it wasn 't just communism ; it was the state that collapsed as well .
and a significant minority of those 500 million people like to spend some of their leisure time and spare cash sleeping with prostitutes , sticking 50 euro notes up their nose and employing illegal migrant laborers .
this boat is worth one million euros when it 's new .
on a positive note , we at last have someone in the white house who has consistently spoken out against these corrosive entities .
the drugs policy which we 've had in place for 40 years is long overdue for a very serious rethink , in my opinion .
and it was very soon when the cybercriminals learned that the quickest way to do this , of course , the quickest way to a person 's wallet is through the promise of sex and love .
this is a mighty industry , and it creates instability and violence wherever it goes .
now , we 've made great progress with automobile technology over the last 100 years .
the vision here is to have each local community play to its natural strength in creating the hydrogen .
they 're usually parked within 100 feet of the people that own them .
larry burns : yeah , we 're absolutely serious .
we needed to reduce the population growth rate .
so some of the monks in the villages were doing the same thing themselves .
if you 're pregnant , take care of your pregnancy .
and what happened ?
he became the chairman of the national aids committee and increased the budget fifty-fold .
and also , in traffic , the policemen give you condoms -- our " cops and rubbers " programs .
and then what happened ?
and we believe if you want to help the poor , those who are living in poverty , access to credit must be a human right .
and here is a bamboo building -- all of them are bamboo .
they draw pictures of what they 're observing with their eyes , through technology like telescopes and microscopes , and also what they 're thinking about in their minds .
and that 's how i really began . so let 's begin .
this is work from a number of years ago , but what i 'll show you next is updated science , it 's updated technology .
one set of dna goes to one side , the other side gets the other set of dna -- identical copies of dna .
it broadcasts through chemical signals telling the rest of the cell when it 's ready , when it feels that everything is aligned and ready to go for the separation of the chromosomes .
but most medical researchers -- discovering the stuff is simply steps along the path to the big goals , which are to eradicate disease , to eliminate the suffering and the misery that disease causes and to lift people out of poverty .
compassion is a piece of vocabulary that could change us if we truly let it sink into the standards to which we hold ourselves and others , both in our private and in our civic spaces .
when we see it , we recognize it and it changes the way we think about what is doable , what is possible .
but again and again , lived compassion brings us back to the wisdom of tenderness .
we all know about the albert einstein who came up with e = mc2 .
gandhi , too , was a real flawed human being .
last year alone , 99 federally declared disasters were on file with fema , from joplin , missouri , and tuscaloosa , alabama , to the central texas wildfires that just happened recently .
this means the exo can actually be transported and set up faster than any other housing option available today .
and on top of that , now we have a whole plethora of other individuals that have come up and started to talk to us from doing it for mining camps , mobile youth hostels , right down to the world cup and the olympics .
that area of design interests me the most , and i think this for me is a real clear , very simplified version of what i 'm talking about .
the first book is called , " the end of print , " and it was done along with a film , working with william burroughs .
" don 't mistake legibility for communication . "
so , this is a project for nine inch nails .
you can 't really -- well , you can 't see it at all -- but the second line is really the more kind of payoff , in a sense .
so , we tried to take this -- what was perceived as a negative : their over-competitiveness , their , you know , long working hours -- and turn it into a positive and not run from it .
article on bryan ferry -- just really boring article -- so i set the whole article in dingbat .
and -- i gave a talk in new york a couple months after this , and afterwards somebody came up to me and they said that -- they actually emailed me -- and they said that they appreciated the talk , and when they got back to their car , they found a note on their car that made them think maybe new york was getting back to being new york again after this event -- it had been a few months .
it 's friendly -- she 's underlined friendly -- that 's probably why she calls it hercules or hercles . she can 't spell .
you 're going to be dead a really long time .
i think these graceful insects are truly miraculous because they so beautifully illuminate the creative improvisation of evolution .
fireflies completely reinvent their bodies as they grow .
so he flies closer and he flashes again .
so the hunt begins with the predator — she 's shown here in the lower left — where she 's sitting quietly and eavesdropping on the courtship conversation of her intended prey , and here 's how it might go .
i hope you 'll understand my english .
speaking about the design : every city has its own design .
that 's why , i 'm trying to say , it 's like metro-nizing the bus .
so , when the only woman in your life is your mother-in-law , you have a problem .
if you cut two zeros , it 's much better .
and she called , and she said , " i 'm really struggling with how to write about you on the little flyer . "
and this is where my story starts .
well , you know that situation where you get an evaluation from your boss , and she tells you 37 things you do really awesome , and one thing -- an " opportunity for growth ? "
so , i could tell you a lot about shame , but i 'd have to borrow everyone else 's time .
what 's the theme ? what 's the pattern ?
and it did .
and i know that vulnerability is the core of shame and fear and our struggle for worthiness , but it appears that it 's also the birthplace of joy , of creativity , of belonging , of love .
am i alone in struggling with vulnerability ?
god .
we perfect .
this is what i have found : to let ourselves be seen , deeply seen , vulnerably seen ; to love with our whole hearts , even though there 's no guarantee -- and that 's really hard , and i can tell you as a parent , that 's excruciatingly difficult -- to practice gratitude and joy in those moments of terror , when we 're wondering , " can i love you this much ?
it 's five magnifying glasses with a shot glass under each one .
bike designer : this is [ unclear ] , custom bike designer .
here i 'll quote one of my students who said , " sex is so good , it 's good even when it 's bad . "
now , when we look at these three ideas together , you 'll notice that the five senses theory doesn 't only change the way we use these products but also the way they look .
not a trivial matter .
today , 6,800 of those are extinct , no longer to be seen again .
" as grown in new york , the fruit usually fails to develop properly in size and quality and is , on the whole , unsatisfactory . "
so i 've picked two examples here , and i want to show you .
disasters have happened . in recent years we lost the gene bank , the seed bank in iraq and afghanistan . you can guess why .
and here 's the front door of this facility .
this particular picture that you see shows the national collection of the united states , of canada , and an international institution from syria .
my big idea would be that while we think of it as commonplace to endow an art museum or endow a chair at a university , we really ought to be thinking about endowing wheat .
but when you get home or want to go indoors at your work , it 's got to be small enough and maneuverable enough to use inside .
so because we tested it with wheelchair users , with wheelchair manufacturers , we got that feedback from them , not just articulating their problems , but articulating their solutions , and worked together to go back to the drawing board and make a new design , which we brought back to east africa in ' 09 that worked a lot better than a normal wheelchair on rough terrain , but it still didn 't work well indoors because it was too big , it was heavy , it was hard to move around , so again with that user feedback , we went back to the drawing board , came up with a better design , 20 pounds lighter , as narrow as a regular wheelchair , tested that in a field trial in guatemala , and that advanced the product to the point where we have now that it 's going into production .
i rested for a day at home .
that data is logged . we 're logging about 500 different parameters within the data systems , about 13,000 health parameters and events to say when things are not working the way they should do , and we 're sending that data back to the garage using telemetry at a rate of two to four megabits per second .
it 's a patient with a heart problem .
there 's no rocket science here .
it 's a beard trimmer , you see ?
i will take enough of these . mm .
billions of dollars are spent every year , all over the globe , on these charlatans .
now , this is a process that is called cold reading .
now , it may bring a certain amount of comfort , but that comfort lasts only about 20 minutes or so .
duh .
well , pretty well anyway .
the answer may surprise you .
you know , 700 dollars for a 20 minute reading over the telephone -- that 's more than lawyers make !
there 's nothing like sitting in that library and having a family appear there and say that mum gave away all the family fortune .
there are over 40,000 described species of spiders .
we spend long days ...
there are several features that all these silks have in common . they all have a common design , such as they 're all very long -- they 're sort of outlandishly long compared to other proteins .
we think that 's because the dragline silk , which is used to make the frame and radii for a web , needs to be very strong .
in fact , the toughest dragline in this survey is this one right here in this white region , a non orb-web-weaving spider .
thank you .
he 's moved from london to new england , over in america .
so dimitri 's now going to use -- he 's used his hand ; he 's used his body .
now we need to have a bit more engagement , and again , what we can do is we can look at the body .
pm : so , milo 's being called back in by his parents , giving us time to be alone and to help him out .
we don 't know anyone .
and i love those revolutions , and i love the future that milo brings .
and that job is that they go around and pick up syringes from the back of hospitals , wash them , and in the course of this , obviously picking them up they injure themselves .
if someone then tries to reuse it , it locks and breaks afterwards .
this one weighs three tons .
and that 's not the only trick we learned from silicon valley .
boom ! yeah . it 's the money shot .
from water security to food security .
thank you very much .
and this has become part of our toolkit for being able to look and see where the activities are in the data , and with it , trace the pattern of , in particular , where my son moved throughout the home , so that we could focus our transcription efforts , all of the speech environment around my son -- all of the words that he heard from myself , my wife , our nanny , and over time , the words he began to produce .
and all of the data , we aligned based on the following idea : every time my son would learn a word , we would trace back and look at all of the language he heard that contained that word .
and finally , my son playing in a walking toy by himself .
we can take the word " bye " as in " good bye . "
same concept , but looking at communication dynamics in a very different sphere .
so a lot of people are following this person -- very influential -- and they have a propensity to talk about what 's on tv .
it 's a cluttered environment ; it 's natural life .
together : the jill and julia , the jill and julia , the jill and julia show . sobule : why are all our heroes so imperfect ? why do they always bring me down ? why are all our heroes so imperfect ? statue in the park has lost his crown . william faulkner , drunk and depressed . sweeney : mmm .
on a scientific basis , it 's more than just " power of positive thinking " -- it has a horrible , horrible dark side . like if you get ill , it 's because you 've just been thinking negative thoughts .
never try to be better than someone else , always learn from others . never cease trying to be the best you can be -- that 's under your control .
and dad would read poetry to us . so i always liked it .
there was a time when i made them wear jackets and shirts and ties .
i didn 't want that . i used to tell them i was paid to do that .
i worked on this for some 14 years , and i think it helped me become a better teacher .
and no one can do more than that .
and i said , " well , i 'd want one that knew why he was at ucl to get an education , he was a good student , really knew why he was there in the first place .
but they had outstanding shooting percentages , because they didn 't force it .
in the northwest quadrant of british columbia , an area of land the size of oregon , there 's one road , a narrow ribbon of asphalt that slips up the side of the coast mountains to the yukon .
the tahltan have been able , with the support of all canadians who live downstream , all local politicians , to resist this assault on their homeland , but now everything hangs in the balance .
so where my work as a graphic designer was to follow strategy , my work now follows my heart and my interests with the guidance of my ego to create work that is mutually beneficial to myself and a client .
but then as well , i was able to just flip them , rotate them and combine them in different ways to create either regular patterns or abstract patterns .
this is what you can do with some household tinfoil .
and i started by doing just a single image like this and sending them out to each person .
" you 've never really been sure of this , but i can assure you that this quirk you 're so self-conscious of is intensely endearing .
but ultimately , i don 't consider that a worthy goal .
as a speech scientist , i 'm fascinated by how the voice is produced , and i have an idea for how it can be engineered .
dr. bunnell is an expert in speech synthesis , and what he 'd been doing is building personalized voices for people by putting together pre-recorded samples of their voice and reconstructing a voice for them .
it 's that simple .
this is samantha .
what i want to share with you next is how i envision taking this work to that next level .
and when i say nothing , i do mean nothing .
i hadn 't really thought that it could be sort of preventative in nature , until i was about 20 , when a number of things happened in my life in quite quick succession , really serious things which just flipped my life upside down and all of a sudden i was inundated with thoughts , inundated with difficult emotions that i didn 't know how to cope with .
now we 're not here for that long anyway , but to spend almost half of our life lost in thought and potentially quite unhappy , dunno , it just kind of seems tragic , actually , especially when there 's something we can do about it , when there 's a positive , practical , achievable , scientifically proven technique which allows our mind to be more healthy , to be more mindful and less distracted .
oh , i really am worried . wow , there 's so much anxiety . "
and i was there , and i worked in that job because i believe that technology can improve people 's lives .
it 's got a microprocessor inside .
i 'm going to show you a video now of a man named ash . you can see him walking .
do they all get there on time ? the supply chain .
we really , truly believe that if a product is going to reach users at the scale that it 's needed , it needs to be market-driven , and market-driven means that products are sold .
and to me she represents the next generation of engineers solving problems and ensuring meaningful technologies reach their users .
and that 's also modernized today , and it 's supporting work for 300 weavers .
if there are 15 operations , you know that none of them work .
it 's wonderful . do you know what the world will be saved by ?
well , you know precisely what it is .
and here he is , 2,400 years ago : " where there is love of humankind , there is love of healing . "
and what are the great leaders doing distinctly different to thrive and grow ?
you know , we hear often about good ol ' boy networks and they 're certainly alive and well in many institutions .
so , this is my grandfather , salman schocken , who was born into a poor and uneducated family with six children to feed , and when he was 14 years old , he was forced to drop out of school in order to help put bread on the table .
so i 'd like to share with you a story about a self-study , self-empowering computer science course that i built , together with my brilliant colleague noam nisan .
and nand2tetris became one of the first massive , open , online courses , although seven years ago we had no idea that what we were doing is called moocs .
i 'm sick of it .
so after some guided trial and error , the child will discover , with or without help , that he or she can duplicate the original figure and then take the result , transpose it , glue it to the original and then proceed [ with ] what we did before : cut , rearrange , paste — oops — paste and glue , and tile .
and i remember my first real contact with octopus was probably at age five or six .
so i was staring at this animal about six or seven inches away , and at that time i could actually focus that close ; now as i look at my fuzzy fingers i realize those days are long gone .
and apparently , evolution had occurred at a pretty rapid rate on one tree , between the time they named it and the time i arrived , because i 'm sure there were at least three trees on that island when we were there .
it was fantastic .
and the top of this mountain range is splitting apart , creating a rift valley .
but you go back to the same vent eight years later and it can be completely dead .
and fertilizers and pesticides are flowing into the bay from the golf course -- the pesticides killing all the larvae and little animals , fertilizer creating this beautiful plankton bloom -- and there 's your pea soup .
look in your heart , actually .
now , i don 't get a wish , but i certainly can say that i will do anything i can to support sylvia earle 's wish .
not only would it lift , but it might never return .
it didn 't work very well on the schizophrenics , but it was pretty clear in the ' 30s and by the middle of the ' 40s that electroconvulsive therapy was very , very effective in the treatment of depression .
it had to do with being brought up in a family where no one spoke english , no one could read or write english .
and it was clear -- not to me , because nothing was clear to me at that time anymore -- that i would need long-term hospitalization in that awful place called a mental hospital .
they thought he had a really extraordinary future .
and i 've never forgotten -- i never will forget -- standing in the kitchen of the unit , it was a sunday morning in january of 1974 , standing in the kitchen by myself and thinking , " i 've got the strength now to do this . "
i stopped doing surgery about six years ago and became a full-time writer , as many people know .
if i , with the bleakness of spirit , with no spirit , that i had in the 1970s and no possibility of recovery , as far as that group of very experienced psychiatrists thought , if i can find my way back from this , believe me , anybody can find their way back from any adversity that exists in their lives .
you know , rather than drive today , i 'm going to walk .
the moral imperative is on the table .
it is very tough .
we can do everything .
so dr. deqo has to explain .
now my place is 90,000 people who are respecting each other , who are not fighting .
i was sort of astonished to find out how many i have actually .
more than the curlers some of the women seemed constantly to have in their hair in preparation for some great event -- a ball , one would think -- that never came to pass ; more than the way most women 's faces not only were never made up during the day , but seemed scraped , bleached , and , with their plucked eyebrows , scarily masklike ; more than all that it was those dresses that made women so unknowable and forbidding , adepts of enigmas to which men could have no access , and boys no conception .
gray-yellow hair , army pants under a nightgown , her turning away , hiding her ravaged face in her hands , muttering an inappropriate " hi . "
i think i 'll lighten up a little .
not excrement merely , not merely surface and orifice going unwashed , rediffusion of rum , there was will in it , and intention , power and purpose -- a social , ethical rage and rebellion -- despair too , though , grief , loss .
yes , the girl falls , absurd to fall , even the earth with its compulsion to take unto itself all that falls must know that falling is absurd , yet the girl falling isn 't myself , or she is myself , but a self i took of my own volition unto myself .
i kept finding myself at her page .
it 's a great honor to be here .
and really , this is the reason i came here tonight .
so the first commandment i want to leave you tonight is , a city of the future has to be environmentally friendly .
this is actually a station that we 're doing in rio .
so you see , they are spread all over the city .
you cannot deal with a city if it 's not socially integrated .
so how 's the weather in rio now ?
let me get you the fleet of our waste collection trucks .
thank you very much .
and to understand that , you have to understand a little bit about how stealth works .
and algorithmic trading evolved in part because institutional traders have the same problems that the united states air force had , which is that they 're moving these positions -- whether it 's proctor & amp ; gamble or accenture , whatever -- they 're moving a million shares of something through the market .
and the gag is that , of course , these aren 't just running through the market .
wouldn 't that be handy ?
and the problem with that is that people freak out .
and the reality is that the further away you are from that , you 're a few microseconds behind every time .
and the landscape was always made by this sort of weird , uneasy collaboration between nature and man .
it 's full of panic and fear , and i 'd heard the women wailing and crying in the desert .
and i 'd heard this before as well .
and so we see that violence is , in a way , behaving like a contagious disease .
they were using parks they weren 't using before .
so anyway , additionally , there was still this problem , and we were getting highly criticized as well for not dealing with all of these other problems .
and i love information .
and apparently it 's being remade right now and it 's going to be coming out next year .
so there was always going to be a tension within that .
which brings me to the final element of this .
and when noah had done built his ark ...
so i did it : i found out how many women had been raped en route to these camps .
we had 15 to 20 , maybe 22 percent of the global brazil-nut market .
we 've got to wake up to the fact that we don 't have any more and that this is a finite planet .
there 's very good evidence -- again , we don 't necessarily have a peer-reviewed methodology that 's bulletproof yet -- but there 's very good evidence that the average cat in europe has a larger environmental footprint in its lifetime than the average african .
but it basically raises a fundamental question : should consumers have a choice about sustainability , about sustainable products ?
sustainability has got to be a pre-competitive issue .
are we going to work with 6.9 billion consumers ?
because if these companies demand sustainable products , they 'll pull 40 to 50 percent of production .
for the big companies , it 's reputational risk , but more importantly , they don 't care what the price of commodities is .
we don 't have to change the way a single chinese company works if we get cargill to only send sustainable palm oil to china .
this is the subsidy from nature .
and in front of all that noise , you do a very small gesture .
you know , arthur rubinstein , the pianist , used to say that , " anywhere in the world , people that have the flu , they go to the doctor .
and all those stories are being heard at the same time .
and then -- sort of -- so not only the instruction is clear , but also the sanction , what will happen if you don 't do what i tell you .
that 's the first one . the fourth one you 'll like better .
audience : itay talgam : good . now like a karajan . since you 're already trained , let me concentrate , close my eyes . come , come .
it 's my music . the real music is only in karajan 's head .
but here and there and that . you know what to do .
let 's see the next video , please . see what happens here .
you have this control . you have this control . and all you put together , in partnership , brings about the best music .
now , if you are doing all the things we talked about , together , and maybe some others , you can get to this wonderful point of doing without doing .
i don 't conceive of it that way .
big businesses have recognized this , and what 's fascinating about this slide , it 's not that the guys can carry boxes on their heads and run around without dropping them off .
the name is a misnomer .
so this goes on in the formal economy as well as the informal economy , so it 's wrong of us to blame — and i 'm not singling out siemens , i 'm saying everyone does it . okay ?
within 40 years , physicists discovered the whole explanation , expressed , as usual , in elegant symbols .
so they believed that knowledge came from authorities that actually knew very little .
and the unseen , you have to admit , doesn 't come to us through the senses .
yours comes from guesswork , ours from the bible . "
i think there is one thing you have to care about .
for instance , we know , independently of seasons , that surfaces tilted away from radiant heat are heated less , and that a spinning sphere , in space , points in a constant direction .
as a child , i was raised by native hawaiian elders -- three old women who took care of me while my parents worked .
you will go far away .
in fact , the hull of the canoe is the womb of the vessel .
we must course-correct .
the who and the why are what 's important to me .
pole caught -- no bycatch .
sylvia likes to say that blue is the new green .
but green foods often represent a way for us to disregard the responsibility as eaters .

plastics take hundreds to thousands of years to biodegrade .
so we figured , if there are places along our fraser river that are contaminated with phthalates , and if there are bacteria that are able to live in these areas , then perhaps , perhaps these bacteria could have evolved to break down phthalates .
we were happy to see that , although our three strains had been previously identified bacteria , two of them were not previously associated with phthalate degradation , so this was actually a novel discovery .
thank you . jy : thank you .
i develop photographs , and kodak said , " keep it simple . "
we 're human beings : we love complex things .

this is an analysis we 've done , where on the left is where the crops are today , on the right is where they could be based on soils and climate , assuming climate change doesn 't disrupt too much of this , which is not a good assumption .
and i love silver buckshot . you put it together and you 've got something really powerful , but we need to put them together .
agriculture uses 60 times more land than urban and suburban areas combined .
we need a bigger conversation , an international dialogue .
now , even at this stage , we can use the brain model to explore some fundamental questions about how the brain works .
but i cannot say , " you think , therefore you are , " because " you " are within my perceptual bubble .
they were so successful in evolution that what we did was to duplicate them over and over and add more and more of them to the brain until we ran out of space in the skull .
how many trees does it have ?
and your neurons are not going to be oriented and positioned in exactly the same way .

now to bring home the point of how close it is -- the relationship between the grid of neurons and the topographical arrangement of the activity of the neurons and our mental experience -- i 'm going to tell you a personal story .
and the great beauty is that you can then go from memory , out of those association cortices , and produce back images in the very same regions that have perception .

we all know the facts .
on the political front , the worst problem is corruption .
now , i want to clarify something .
what is the mechanism in the chinese model that allows people to say , actually , the national interest as you defined it is wrong ?
because , by western definitions , a so-called civil society has to be separate or even in opposition to the political system , but that concept is alien for chinese culture .
they all crawl in different ways , and you can see on the right , that we actually made a couple of these things , and they work in reality . these are not very fantastic robots , but they evolved to do exactly what we reward them for : for moving forward . so that was all done in simulation , but we can also do that on a real machine .
what happens if you don 't reward them for anything , you just throw them in ?
" thank you for taking me to a place that i didn 't know existed . thank you . "
well , of course now we know we don 't have to change a plug , now we 've seen that wonderful demonstration of the wireless electric -- fantastic . you know , it inspires us .

its initial version was skillfully mediated by senator george mitchell .
changes and shortcomings in leadership , more off than on international diplomacy and institutional failures account for this in almost equal measure .

j during the recent tour by the simon bolivar youth orchestra of venezuela of u.s. and europe , we saw how our music moved young audiences to the bottom of their souls , how children and adolescents rushed up to the stage to receive the jackets from our musicians , how the standing ovations , sometimes 30 minutes long , seemed to last forever , and how the public , after the concert was over , went out into the street to greet our young people in triumph .
it 's a program of social rescue and deep cultural transformation designed for the whole venezuelan society with absolutely no distinctions whatsoever , but emphasizing the vulnerable and endangered social groups .
the idea is that the families join with pride and joy in the activities of the orchestras and the choirs that their children belong to .
let 's start with city hall .
it 's an article about a theater performance , and it starts with basic information about where it is , in case you actually want to go and see it after you 've read the article -- where , the time , the website .

he 's got some seizure disorder . and you don 't understand this .
because we were in the age before anesthesia , the agony of the patient is really as much of the public spectacle as the surgery itself .
something so simple .
surgeons had to give up their 3d vision .
this is all done in between the ribs .
so we had to ask the question , " well how do we fix that ? "
as we take these capabilities , and we get to go to the next places , we get to decide what our new surgeries are going to be .

i think it will be quite a challenge for me .

but private optimism about our own personal future remains persistent .
the optimism bias has been observed in many different countries -- in western cultures , in non-western cultures , in females and males , in kids , in the elderly .
the behavioral economist george lowenstein asked students in his university to imagine getting a passionate kiss from a celebrity , any celebrity .
people with mild depression , they don 't have a bias when they look into the future .
and then we told them the average likelihood of someone like them to suffer these misfortunes .
one of these regions is called the left inferior frontal gyrus .
then we interfered with the brain region that we found to integrate good news in this task , and the optimism bias disappeared .
it 's like visual illusions , in which understanding them does not make them go away .
and every kid , you know , as a teenager , has got his bedroom he retreats to -- but i wanted my door , i thought it would be cool if my door went up rather than opened , like on star trek .

and this was complicated because we needed to take into account the fact that the network structure , the architecture of the ties , was changing across time .

so the friend of a friend of a 's is , back again , a friend of a 's , whereas the friend of a friend of b 's is not a friend of b 's , but is farther away in the network .
and finally , we even found that 30 percent of the variation in whether or not people are in the middle or on the edge of the network can also be attributed to their genes .
i think understanding social networks and how they form and operate can help us understand not just health and emotions but all kinds of other phenomena -- like crime , and warfare , and economic phenomena like bank runs and market crashes and the adoption of innovation and the spread of product adoption .
as humans , we are sensitive to where an object in our hand is heavy .
it 's fairly simple .
what 's behind that is a postulation , namely that not humans should get much more technical in the future ; rather than that , technology , a bit more human .

haters gonna hate .
two animals , two iconic reptiles really captivated me very early on .

you drink it in peril of your life .
and , sure enough , with all the other pressures on the river , like sand mining , for example , very , very heavy cultivation all the way down to the river 's edge , not allowing the animals to breed anymore , we 're looking at even more problems building up for the gharial , despite the early good intentions .
it flows down through delhi , mathura , agra , and gets just about every bit of effluent you can imagine .

first , i 'll ask you : why should you care ?
one two years earlier had killed more than a million people .
and i also want to talk about what i call our new burden of knowledge .
the second thing i 'd like to talk about : if you were living in a remote village somewhere , your child was limp , and you were in a drought , or you were in floods , or you were in a situation where there wasn 't adequate diversity of diet , what would you do ?
and if you fill the cup with local agriculture from small farmers , you have a transformative effect .
and we said , listen , during the lean season , take the food out .
they have to be nutritious , and they have to be locally produced .

i 'm standing right here with my bag .
when you watch people interacting with animals or other people , there is very little feedback , it 's too infrequent .

bb : there were many changes ...
and david won 't take " no . "
but despite our verbal assurances , they wanted some proof .
so , when you 're faced with something like that , of course you 've got to break it down .
and as you can see , it gives you a pretty crappy performance .
and then we came across some remarkable technology called contour .
we need to put another 40 years on him at this point .
next we had to go into the shooting process .
and then , the sauce i talked about with our technology stew -- that secret sauce was , effectively , software that allowed us to match the performance footage of brad in live action with our database of aged benjamin , the facs shapes that we had .
there was a whole system written in software to articulate the tongue .
a couple of quick factoids ; it really took 155 people over two years , and we didn 't even talk about 60 hairstyles and an all-digital haircut .
it 's knowing your punchline , your ending , knowing that everything you 're saying , from the first sentence to the last , is leading to a singular goal , and ideally confirming some truth that deepens our understandings of who we are as human beings .
but once he gets there , he 's found out that his uncle has mysteriously passed away and been entombed in a mausoleum on the property .
they just don 't want to know that they 're doing that .
and i learned a key insight to character .
and that 's why change is fundamental in story .
and they were : no songs , no " i want " moment , no happy village , no love story .
i said , take care of them .
boy : hey ! hey ! hey ! hey !
it can 't be artificially evoked .
as : and that 's the first story lesson i ever learned .
and one more thing : archie was suffering from this illness himself .
and then he goes back to his quarters , breaks down and weeps because he 's convinced that the situation is hopeless .
and he 'd be showing you these amazing statistics , these amazing animations .
in about the length of this session , you would have counted all 5,000 .
but the way we solve them is with humility -- to abandon the god complex and to actually use a problem-solving technique that works .
you scoop it up . you put it in cardboard boxes .
and the moment you step back from the god complex -- let 's just try to have a bunch of stuff ; let 's have a systematic way of determining what 's working and what 's not -- you can solve your problem .
you think it 's obvious ?
should they recover in a specialized cardiac unit in hospital , or should they recover at home ?
tumbleweed rolls through the meeting room .
he said , " he was not a very careful person as a mathematician .
but here was this kid who loved transformers and snoopy and the ninja turtles , and the characters that i read about , i fell in love with , and they became my friends .
so i love that last sentence : " he liked making this book . "
very wise man , because he knew i would , i felt like i was making the decision on my own , and he knew i wouldn 't choose st. john 's , so i went to holy name high school , which was a tough transition because , like i said , i didn 't play sports , and it was very focused on sports , but i took solace in mr. shilale 's art room .
on my 14th birthday , my grandfather and my grandmother gave me the best birthday present ever : a drafting table that i have worked on ever since .
and when i was 17 , i met my father for the first time , upon which i learned i had a brother and sister i had never known about .
and i sent out one last batch of postcards .
and for him , it 's only his second .
that 's true . you are alive , and that 's pretty good right now .
and i said , " well , funny you should ask .
and i said , " yes . "
and then she got all caught up in the legs . " but how would the legs go , mom ?
i 'm going to start way back in the third grade at oakdale school in barberton , ohio .
if you don 't say the right creative thing , you 're going to be judged .
in fact , everything was better than fine .
he 's worked for ge , and he 's had a fantastic career .
and the hospital and ge were happy too .
and so there were lots of projects that i could work on .
i was too young , unmarried , i had no children , didn 't really know africa , and besides , my french was pitiful .
and they said , " blue , blue , we love blue . let 's do it blue . "
and so , on a micro level , there 's a real role for this combination of investment and philanthropy .
and i think some of you may have visited -- these farmers are helped by kickstart and technoserve , who help them become more self-sufficient .
acumen came in with the patient capital , and we also helped to identify the entrepreneur that we would all partner with here in africa , and exxon provided the initial resin .
and so we came in with a second round of patient capital to a to z , a loan as well as a grant , so that a to z could play with pricing and listen to the marketplace , and found a number of things .
it takes investing in those entrepreneurs that are committed to service as well as to success .
we ended up being the first medical response team in every incident location and transported 125 victims , saving life .
imagine you are being asked to pay a bribe in your day-to-day life to get something done .
and it is an absolutely virgin market .
so we actually used the right to information act , which is equal to the freedom of information act in the united states , and pushed back the officers in this particular case .
in tana toraja , the most important social moments in people 's lives , the focal points of social and cultural interaction are not weddings or births or even family dinners , but funerals .
but instead of giving in to the sort of visceral reaction we have to this idea of proximity to bodies , proximity to death , or how this notion just does not fit into our very biological or medical sort of definition of death , i like to think about what the torajan way of viewing death encompasses of the human experience that the medical definition leaves out .
it 's called the sunga ' .
perhaps one of the answers to the challenges that are facing the u.s. healthcare system , particularly in the end-of-life care , is as simple as a shift in perspective , and the shift in perspective in this case would be to look at the social life of every death .
the problem is , i don 't think these projections are accurate .
and i will vouch that it handled the stop-and-go traffic on u.s. 101 very smoothly .
there has been one story , one development in human history that bent the curve , bent it just about 90 degrees , and it is a technology story .
waste was not reduced ; it was eliminated .
all these things are share-platforms , but sharing ultimately starts and ends with what i refer to as the " mother of all share-platforms . "
basically zipcar is the largest car-sharing company in the world .
but when you 're sharing a car and you have a car-share service , you might use an e.v. to commute , you get a truck because you 're doing a home project .
zipcar started a decade earlier , in 2000 .
so creating craigslist or itunes and the iphone developer network , there are all these networks -- facebook as well .
essentially , there are all sorts of restaurants in oakland , near where i live .
but they were very transparent , or they had to be , in the way that they exposed what worked and didn 't work .
in the future you 're going to be checking all your vital signs , all your vital signs : your heart rhythm , your blood pressure , your oxygen , your temperature , etc .
so , we 're not just talking about physiologic metrics -- the key measurements of vital signs , and all those things in physiology -- but also all the imaging that one could look at in your smartphone .
well , we can . first of all , heart failure is the number one reason for hospital admissions and readmissions in this country .
however you have to put in most of this stuff .
you say , " oh , ok . " and a z.q. score is adjusted to age , and you want to get as high as you possibly can .
eighty percent of americans have chronic disease , or 80 percent of age greater than 65 have two or more chronic disease , 140 million americans have one or more chronic disease , and 80 percent of our 1.5 , whatever , trillion expenditures are related to chronic disease .
and that 's before we got going on the m-health world .
we can tell who 's going to get breast cancer from the various genes .
they can listen for echoes from prey in order to decide where food is and to decide which one they want to eat .
by contrast , the signature whistle which dolphins use to stay in touch , each individual here has a radically different call .
anybody looking at this picture will know this dolphin is surrounded , and clearly his behavior is being disrupted .
that same sound traveled to the west , and could be heard in bermuda , and traveled to the east , and could be heard in monterey -- the same sound .
so you 're listening to the complicated song produced by humpbacks here .
now after i play back these humpback calls , i 'll play blue whale calls , but they have to be sped up because they 're so low in frequency that you wouldn 't be able to hear it otherwise .
and as we get farther away , the sound gets fainter and fainter .
it 's an amazing shift , induced by humans over this large scale , in both time and space .
it turns out that this lane here goes right through a major feeding area of right whales in the summer time , and it makes an area of a significant risk of collision .
i hope these examples have shown some of the different directions we can take in addition to protected areas to be able to keep the ocean safe for whales to be able to continue to communicate .
and that was really exciting to a journalist , but the most interesting part was when i got back home , actually , because i learned that i had been watched by more than 90,000 people , and i got hundreds of emails and messages of people asking me , basically , how did i do it , how it was possible to do such a thing .
but there was another conflict , the one i believe that 's more important here to make my point that it was a narrative conflict .
that 's something that no tv channel could ever do .
and i believe it does something else that might be even more important , that the simplicity of the technology can merge objectivity and subjectivity in a very political way , as i see it , because it really helps the audience , the citizen , to see the world through somebody else 's eye , so it helps the citizen to put him- or herself in other people 's place .
what if they look up at the night sky , at the same stars , but from the opposite side ?
alright , one billion stars .
the second is that problems are soluble .
so this " ascent " of man , pinnacle of evolution , has got to go .
and over those long distances , its signal is very faint when it reaches us .
and this is a technically creative challenge , and it would change the perspective of people who worked on it .
as the length of the construction takes years , workers end up forming a rather rough-and-ready informal city , making for quite a juxtaposition against the sophisticated structures that they 're building .
it 's remarkable to see the design decisions that they 're making , like when everything is made out of red bricks , some residents will cover that red brick with another layer of red brick-patterned wallpaper just to make it a kind of clean finish .
they were floating through the canals in a large canoe with a fitted-out generator for all of the community to enjoy .
every apartment is unique , and this individuality tells a story about each family 's circumstances and values .
today , you see these large residential development projects which offer cookie-cutter housing solutions to massive amounts of people .
it began a little less than two years ago .
we were burning about 8,500 a day , so we needed it .
thank you very much . thank you .
and the creator very considerately offered a replay for her mom .
when you really look at it , how is it that young people spend most of their time using new technologies ?
so in scratch , to code , you just snap blocks together .
as kids are creating projects like this , they 're learning to code , but even more importantly , they 're coding to learn .
and that creates some new blocks for you , and also creates a little scoreboard that keeps track of the score , so each time i click on " change score , " it increments the score .
regardless of whether he grows up to be a marketing manager or a mechanic or a community organizer , that these ideas are useful for everybody .
every time we make irrational demands , exhibit irresponsible behavior or display any other signs of being normal american citizens , we are called childish .
-- has a program called kids design glass , and kids draw their own ideas for glass art .
well , we heard that one too , but " pioneer germ fighters " totally rules .
and in case you don 't think that this really has meaning for you , remember that cloning is possible , and that involves going through childhood again , in which case you 'll want to be heard just like my generation .
think about the mind as being like a house with many rooms , most of which we 're very familiar with .
others use dancing , spinning and circling to promote self-transcendence .
now profane is the opposite of sacred .
is it a product of natural selection , like our hands ?
and only a few of these guys are going to go on in the sport .
and in short order , the cooperators are done for .
these early wasps gave rise to the bees and the ants that have covered the world and changed the biosphere .
if it is an adaptation , then we evolved to be religious .
one great challenge of modern life is to find the staircase amid all the clutter and then to do something good and noble once you climb to the top .
so we 've set out to look for genes that control aging .
but everything else is just lying there .
and the daf-2 gene encodes a hormone receptor .
and the hormone igf-1 promotes growth .
they hardly get cancer , and when they do it 's not as severe .
they have the ability to protect themselves from many kinds of damage , which we think makes them live longer .
and then the hurricane comes through , and the house is in much better condition than it would normally have been in .
and you can take rapamycin and give it to a mouse -- even when it 's pretty old , like age 60 for a human , that old for a mouse -- if you give the mouse rapamycin , it will live longer .
and also , there are other ways of activating foxo that don 't even involve insulin or igf-1 that might even be safer .
yes , that 's right .
even the lockset is probably worth 200 dollars .
the barley hops design worked up into the eaves , then the dentil work comes directly off the can 's red , white , blue and silver .
but then if you put it in the front door , people say , " oh , you 're trying to be like those guys , and you didn 't make it . "
that 's not a cell phone .
on the one hand , we have an apollonian perspective , which is very crisp and premeditated and intellectualized and perfect .
we create mountains of waste .
and the irony is that he wasn 't very good at math .
it 's gone now . "
he said human beings act differently when they know they 're alone than when they know somebody else is around .
and so you see this in junior high a lot .
if failure destroys you , then you can 't do this .
this is an example of a real meteorite , and you can see all the melting of the iron from the speed and the heat when a meteorite hits the earth , and just how much of it survives and melts .
but why is this so interesting ? here 's the quick story .
here is some of the lower level of the library , where the exhibits constantly change .
now , you might say , what does this have to do with this ?
the connection is the energy it takes to run the web , and to make everything we think possible , possible .
now there is another side to this .
a kindergarten teacher i know , her son donated all of his toys to her , and when he did , she had to go through and pull out all the little plastic guns .
i want to write about this really interesting world .
but less directly , the lack of male presence in the culture -- you 've got a teachers ' lounge , and they 're having a conversation about joey and johnny who beat each other up on the playground .
it 's coming from us .
all of those conversations need to be happening .
it wasn 't for me .
and so it 's going to try to watch your response .
right , so , a doctor says to his patient , " i have bad news and worse news .
first , let 's make sure he 's dead . "
i will start by posing a little bit of a challenge : the challenge of dealing with data , data that we have to deal with in medical situations .
that 's one patient , one data set .
i want to look at the blood vessels . i want to look at the liver .
this is a data set that was captured using a ct scanner .
now at this point , i would also like to emphasize that , with the greatest respect for the people that i 'm now going to show -- i 'm going to show you a few cases of virtual autopsies -- so it 's with great respect for the people that have died under violent circumstances that i 'm showing these pictures to you .
the person was killed by stabs in the heart , but they just deposited the knife by putting it through one of the eyeballs .
so it gained some traction , and we 're trying to roll this out and trying to use it for educational purposes , but also , perhaps in the future , in a more clinical situation .
and he 's sitting there in front of the haptic device , the force feedback system , and he 's moving his pen towards the heart , and the heart is now beating in front of him , so he can see how the heart is beating .
and then he can see that at the same time .
so this is a cat scan -- computer aided tomography .
so , some very talented people .
it took eight years of blood , sweat and tears to reach 350 employees , something which i was very proud of in the business .
and something ... good luck with that one in the japanese translation room .
jeff bezos kindly remarked to me , " chris , ted is a really great conference .
already , just in the last few days , we 've had so many people talking about stuff that they care about , that they 're passionate about , that can make a difference in the world , and the idea of getting this group of people together -- some of the causes that we believe in , the money that this conference can raise and the ideas -- i really believe that that combination will , over time , make a difference .
thank you .
it wasn 't just compassion for europe , though there was that .
of course , the details of policy are going to be different , because the challenge is different .
i 've looked to see what is the relationship between higher commodity prices of exports , and the growth of commodity-exporting countries .
and the question is whether the short run will persist .
we know these international standards work because we 've already got one .
when i put that to the president of sierra leone , the next day he asked the world bank to send him a team to give expertise on how to conduct auctions .
then this january , my mother died , and pursuing a film like that just seemed the last thing that was interesting to me .
you will adapt to it and get used to it .
they get influenced by things that they 're not aware of .
so in this case , it 's an outside projection for singapore on these giant times square-like screens .
so what i started thinking was , perhaps there is something like open source intelligence here .
you take all of the conflict , all of the chaos , all of the noise , and out of that comes this precise mathematical distribution of the way attacks are ordered in this conflict .
this is data , statistics . what does it tell us about these conflicts ?
what does it look like ?
and this tells me one of two things .
so this is the timeline , and if you 've ever edited video , you 're familiar with this , but instead of clips in the timeline , what you 're looking at is web events pulled into the video .
so , when i was a child , i don 't know how many of you grew up in the ' 50s , but i was sent upstairs for an enforced rest .
you 're asleep . you wake up , and without lifting your head from the earth on your sleeping bag , you can see for 70 miles .
this is an indexical register of a lived moment of a body in time .
just moving on , is it possible , taking that idea of mind , body , body-building , to supplant the first body , the biological body , with the second , the body of architecture and the built environment .
when they appear close to the edge , they are representations , representations in which the viewers have become the viewed .
the children managed to run back onto the tracks .
we don 't think another wave is coming right away .
what became very clear was that , within a few days , the outpouring of information was immense , and we got a complete and powerful picture of what had happened in a way that we never had been able to get before .
there are a few bloggers -- somewhere maybe around 20 , now -- who do , in fact , make some kind of money , and a few who are actually trying to make a full-time living out of it , but the vast majority of them are doing it because they love it or they love the attention , or whatever it is .
that 's the positive side of what is sometimes called participatory journalism or citizen journalism , etc . -- that , in fact , we are giving people who have never been able to talk before a voice , and we 're able to access information that has always been there but has essentially gone untapped .
a lot of people talk about ants .
inspiration is contagious .
and in two hours , after their backs were broke , they were changed .
a glimpse of infection in ahmedabad .
children were designing solutions for a diverse range of problems .
it was a revelation for me . it doesn 't strike me that they had so much inside them .
when i was young , i prided myself as a nonconformist in the conservative u.s. state i live in , kansas .
i 've struggled to say those words , because i didn 't want to be defined by them .
in february , the kansas house of representatives brought up a bill for vote that would have essentially allowed businesses to use religious freedom as a reason to deny gays services .
i 'm sure i was trying to encourage myself to get out and explore london , but the message i missed was the need to start exploring and embracing myself .
so we came together and we created software called ushahidi .
i moved back to kenya in 2011 .
could we leverage these technologies to switch smartly whenever you travel from country to country ?
it is not without challenge .
one particular thing that 's come up that i am especially interested in is the question of whether , when we 're sending military personnel to do these sorts of jobs , we ought to be equipping them differently , and in particular , whether we ought to be giving them access to some of the sorts of non-lethal weapons that police have .
so you 've got traditional things like pepper spray , o.c. spray up at the top there , or tasers over here .
and since we 've already had so many problems with police use of non-lethal weapons in various ways , i thought it would be a really good idea to look at some of those things and try to relate it to the military context .
so you can see there were six deaths sort of leading up to it every year for a number of years .
one of those problems is that non-lethal weapons may be used indiscriminately .
the people you 're going to be shooting at aren 't going to be able to get out of the way .
so she 's 72 , and it 's seen that this is the most appropriate way of dealing with her .
they 're trained to be more restrained in the use of force than the military are .
if this does not blow your mind , then you have no emotion .
and these are just a few .
but i was excited , so i kept going .
how do we take what those teachers are doing to their natural conclusion ?
and the idea is you fast forward and good students start failing algebra all of a sudden and start failing calculus all of a sudden , despite being smart , despite having good teachers , and it 's usually because they have these swiss cheese gaps that kept building throughout their foundation .
and the idea is , from this we can actually teach everything -- well , everything that can be taught in this type of a framework .
and all of the rest .
and we 're seeing it over and over and over again .
bill gates : i 've seen some things you 're doing in the system that have to do with motivation and feedback -- energy points , merit badges .
it 's not an only-in-school thing .
sk : absolutely . and this is something that i recommend everyone in this audience to do .
as i spent time with vivian , i saw that she had sort of a joie de vivre in how she did her work .
that 's where i got reacquainted with abraham maslow 's " hierarchy of needs . "
as i went out and started spending time with other leaders out there and asking them how they were getting through that time , what they told me over and over again was that they just manage what they can measure .
most world leaders didn 't take notice , and those that did thought this was just " buddhist economics . "
how many know him ? anybody ?
i 've taken that robert kennedy quote , and i 've turned it into a new balance sheet for just a moment here .
abe maslow said long ago something you 've heard before , but you didn 't realize it was him .
he tells me that he can always count on vivian and the staff there to make him feel at home .
commoditized : where they 're treated like a commodity , where people don 't care who makes them .
now , over the last several years i spent a lot of time in europe , and particularly in the netherlands , and whenever i talk about the experience economy there , i 'm always greeted at the end with one particular question , almost invariably .
there isn 't a square meter of ground in the entire country that hasn 't been reclaimed from the sea , or otherwise moved , modified and manicured to look as if it had always been there .
and that is , to no surprise , in shakespeare , and in his play , hamlet .
you can think about those two -- you know , both of these better than being fake fake -- not quite as good as being real real .
knowing where your heritage is : what you have done in the past .
that 's why you have companies like starbucks , right , that doesn 't advertise at all .
now , it 's quite an old phenomenon ; it was discovered 100 years ago .
and it turns out that they behave like quantum particles .
you see ? i can adjust and i can rotate the superconductor .
and we could also produce power cables , to transfer enormous amounts of current between power stations .
i grew up in the paris suburbs and i was the youngest of three children .
later on , in france , i loved eavesdropping on grownups ' conversations , and i would hear all sorts of stories about my father 's previous life , especially that he had " done " world war ii , that he had " done " the algerian war .
the whole family came to settle in france in the ' 30s .
of course he knew .
there were obviously financial sacrifices because he always refused to be paid .
and while my half brother and sister thought they 'd been abandoned , orphaned , my father was making false papers .
all my childhood , while my friends ' dads would tell them grimm 's fairy tales , my father would tell me stories about very unassuming heroes with unshakeable utopias who managed to make miracles .
that match was unambiguous .
it 's actually mini-eclipses that occur when a planet passes in front of its star .
the small planets dominated , and there was a certain harmony to that , which actually copernicus was very happy to note , and kepler was one of the big proponents of .
in the next few years we will confirm them .
and let me immediately tell you here , when i say life , i don 't mean " dolce vita , " good life , human life .
from the right bank of the river are the experiments in the lab that i just showed you , where we actually tried that , and it feeds back and forth , and we hope to meet in the middle one day .
let 's think of life as that entire planet because , in a sense , it is .
this is not insignificant .
i wrote on cards : " television , " " radio , " " myspace , " " internet , " " pc . "
everybody in the east coast gets in the pictures -- citicorp , penney , rca -- all getting into this big vision .
of course , the first computer was built just after world war ii to solve military problems , but things got really interesting just a couple of years later -- 1949 with whirlwind , built at mit 's lincoln lab . jay forrester was building this for the navy , but you can 't help but see that the creator of this machine had in mind a machine that might actually be a potential media star .
jf : and before leaving , we would like to show you another kind of mathematical problem that some of the boys have worked out in their spare time , in a less serious vein , for a sunday afternoon .
about 20 percent of all the nation 's programmers were wrapped up in this thing , and it led to an awful lot of what we have today . it also used vacuum tubes .
in fact , despair is in the air .
this proprietary principle of vendor lock-in would go on to be perfected with great success as one of the enduring principles of windowing systems everywhere .
ph : we 'll talk a little bit more about him later .
and most importantly , they had this ethos of sharing information .
this method allows you to use existing videodisc materials in ways which suit your specific needs and interests .
the medium introduced america to new products .
he wrote a list of what the phonograph might be good for when he invented it , and kind of only one of his ideas turned out to have been the right early idea .
ph : oh , but then he remembers he works for rupert murdoch .
here 's a man announcing the new market watch from dow jones , powered 100 percent by the user experience on the home page -- user-generated content married up with traditional content .
and i would like to share with you all some of the pictures that are happening today in yemen .
pm : thank you for those images , nadia .
and i went back home and i said , " daddy , i don 't know who i am .
and i don 't know if i 'm going to be boasting now , but in 2006 alone , we won three international awards .
and then after that , you can take it off on assignments .
and this is probably something i 'm going to share with you in western media probably -- and how there 's a lot of stereotypes -- thinking of yemen in one single frame : this is what yemen is all about .
so it 's about the lack of research , basically .
but there were also revelations .
it arises around cracks in the earth .
clinging to rock , and eating it too ... transforming barren land .
in africa , gondwana molded proteas .
and cetaceans moved into a world without bounds .
design is also driving nature .
as a young man , i imagined a future world where technology so advanced could rid the world of disability , a world in which neural implants would allow the visually impaired to see , a world in which the paralyzed could walk via body exoskeletons .
we also took robotic tools .
we 're also building exoskeletons .
this gentleman does not have any leg condition , any disability .
this video shows lisa mallette shortly after being fitted with two bionic limbs .
a person can never be broken .
we will not be intimidated , brought down , diminished , conquered or stopped by acts of violence .
just like fear offers us protective benefits , disgust seems to do the same thing , except for what disgust does is keeps us away from not things that might eat us , or heights , but rather things that might poison us , or give us disease and make us sick .
this makes it very useful as a strategy if you want to convince somebody that an object or an individual or an entire social group is disgusting and should be avoided .
it turns out that this score is actually meaningful .
in another set of studies we actually simply reminded people -- this was at a time when the swine flu was going around -- we reminded people that in order to prevent the spread of the flu that they ought to wash their hands .
and they would inevitably end up in what i thought was a very bizarre place , which is ways the world could end very suddenly .
people around the world are getting better medicine -- but mentally , we 're falling apart .
it 's becoming obvious that the chance that life does not exist elsewhere in the universe , and probably fairly close to us , is a fairly remote idea .
it wasn 't really a research report ; it was a screed .
they can 't fish there for a radius of 200 miles .
we have an electromagnetic field around the earth , and it 's constantly bombarded by high-energy particles , like protons .
it 's been 780,000 years since this happened .
there 's a flip side to it . in studying stars like our sun , we 've found that they go through periods of diminishment , when their total amount of energy that 's expelled from them goes down by maybe one percent .
a staph cell can be next to a muscle cell in your body and borrow genes from it when antibiotics come , and change and mutate .
but galaxies are very violent places , and things can be spun out of orbit .
an asteroid five miles wide causes major extinctions .
comets are a tougher act .
we know about this stuff .
so , that 's a challenge , not just for organs but also for tissues .
why can 't we ? why can 't humans regenerate ?
we used that biomaterial in the middle .
okay . these are flat structures that we see here , the muscle .
you 're allowing fluid or air to go through at steady states .
so , bladders are definitely a little bit more complex than the other structures .
and instead of using ink , we use -- you just saw an inkjet cartridge -- we just use cells .
and we can then create functional livers .
we don 't need to teach it to become another cell type .
and what i mean by that is that anytime we 've launched one of these technologies to the clinic , we 've made absolutely sure that we do everything we can in the laboratory before we ever launch these technologies to patients .
that 's right . according to scientists , a cheese sandwich is the solution to all your tough decisions .
when the headlines rolled , what happened was , the marketers came calling .
like , just a couple of weeks ago , neuroscientists at mit figured out how to break habits in rats just by controlling neural activity in a specific part of their brain .
no , it 's a hormone called oxytocin .
i am more excited than most people , as a neuroscientist , about the potential for neuroscience to treat mental illness and even maybe to make us better and smarter .
we valued it as the number of seal pelts we could kill .
we went from having literally put alan shepard in suborbital flight to going to the moon in eight years , and the average age of the people that got us there was 26 years old .
but that 's expensive and to understand what the potential is -- -- it is expensive . but people are willing to pay that !
12 to 15 launches per year .
" are you going to compete ? " no . " no one 's going to win this thing . "
we 're based down in florida .
orteig didn 't pay a dime out to the nine teams that went across -- tried to go across the atlantic , and we didn 't pay a dime until someone won the ansari x prize .
why , without them , you 'd be a total stranger . "
she got mad ; i took a licking .

now , i was just a little eight-year-old boy that day when my mama put me out of the car in that hot texas cotton field .
it was a few years ago , but i sort of remembered this story , and i told it at a concert .
and i think i learned a lot about what happiness was by going through such unbelievable grief , just standing on the edge of that abyss and just wanting to jump in .
sometimes i think it 's better just to sink way down in your funky mood ' til you can rise up humming these steel guitar blues .
we made up a little batch and we put it on the driveway and we threw a match and phew , it flared up . ah , it was great .
no problem . yeah , you know . "
i 'm going to be sharing with you how four years ago i almost died -- found out i was , in fact , already almost dead .
yeah , the wavy hair , the blue eyes -- it was really something .
he said , " dave , i pulled up the x-ray image on the screen on the computer at home . "
what we saw in that kidney was that big blob there .
and i 'm thinking , " what the heck ? "
because if you wonder why patients are motivated and want to help , think about this .
anyway , this is the way the numbers unfolded .
patients are such an underutilized resource .
it 's not my data .
how big a deal was this ?
in non-professional circles outside america , it 's largely ignored .
i 've already said that many individual evolutionists , like the pope , are also religious , but i think they 're deluding themselves .
so , returning to tactics and the evolution lobby , i want to argue that rocking the boat may be just the right thing to do .
now , the next one , " the president of the royal society has been vouchsafed a strong inner conviction " -- -- " ... that an asteroid killed the dinosaurs . "
and however we define atheism , it 's surely the kind of academic belief that a person is entitled to hold without being vilified as an unpatriotic , unelectable non-citizen .
well , i haven 't seen the original 42 studies and i can 't comment on that meta-analysis but i would like to see more studies done along those lines .
there should be a snowball effect , a positive feedback , such that the more names we have , the more we get .
now , a friend , an intelligent lapsed jew , who incidentally observed the sabbath for reasons of cultural solidarity , describes himself as a " tooth fairy agnostic . "
it 's completely compatible with the god of the physicists .
let 's all stop being so damned respectful .
it reads the shifting conditions of temperature , humidity , wind direction , wind speed , dew point , and it processes this data in a central computer that calibrates the degree of water pressure and distribution of water throughout .
and , you know , we thought -- well , we tried to convince them .
but these white walls became a kind of target and weapon at the same time .
and this acoustical nuisance and visual nuisance basically exposed the discomfort of the work to this encompassing nature of the retrospective .
the mediatheque has something like 16 stations where the public can get onto the server and look at digital artworks or also curated artworks off the web .
the clients have asked us to produce a great chamber music hall .
we very strongly believe that the theatrics of a concert hall is as much in the space of intermission and the space of arrival as it is when the concert starts .
that 's what i want to talk to you about tonight -- how doing and teaching this type of surgery led us on a search for a better universal translator .
you get your board certificate , and you can go out into practice .
very inspiring .
maybe we have something to learn as well .
but we don 't have the words yet , so we add a third technology .
aim for the black dots .
now let 's advance to 10,000 years before the present .
in the ancient world there was a lot of respect for unintended consequences , and there was a very healthy sense of caution , reflected in the tree of knowledge , in pandora 's box , and especially in the myth of prometheus that 's been so important in recent metaphors about technology .
the patent had 64 pages of text and 271 figures .
and the government research bureau brought representatives together and told them that this is something that has to be done .
there are two historians of business at the university of maryland , brent goldfarb and david kirsch , who have done some extremely interesting work , much of it still unpublished , on the history of major innovations .
we need to see what they can do for us .
i 've recorded lots of cds .
well , it 's just so interesting that donnell 's upbringing was very similar to mine , and i actually saw donnell play when i was about 12 years old , and he and his family came to inverness , which is about 45 minutes from where i lived , and i was just blown away , like , it was just amazing , and you 'll find out why pretty soon here , but i couldn 't believe the fiddling and mom was there with me , and she was saying — donnell 's mother came up on stage and danced with her children , and mom was saying , " that 's julie macdonnell , i used to dance with her when we were kids . little did i think our children would be playing instruments , you know , playing music , yeah . "
nm : with one minute .
nm : no , i want you to tell them about leahy .
i wanted to give you a current picture of the economy .
and as you think about that , you 've got to wonder : so what do banks have in store for you now ?
and then all bets are off .
if you 're under 50 we want you to work four more years .
that wave is much larger , much more powerful , and that 's of course the wave of technology .
then they grow exponentially .
you can freeze half its heart . it regrows .
last year , this group was able to take all the cells off a heart , leaving just the cartilage .
and this stuff is moving very quickly , and by the way , that thing can carry about 350 pounds of weight .
very primitive .
that would be a mildly arrogant viewpoint .
and he lives in the sand , and he catches things that go by overhead .
so we got this incredible video system . it 's very new technology -- it just came out about a year ago -- that allows you to film at extremely high speeds in low light .
so the muscle contracts , and nothing happens .
so , we 've had very solid evidence showing that that saddle-shaped structure actually compresses and extends , and does , in fact , function as a spring .
and so this is just a regular video of the animal just smashing the heck out of this load cell .
there 's that raptorial appendage -- there 's the heel , and it 's going to swing around and hit the load cell .
so , one question i often get after this talk -- so i figured i 'd answer it now -- is , well , what happens to the animal ?
and also the miller institute for basic research in science , which gave me three years of funding to just do science all the time , and for that i 'm very grateful . thank you very much .
large families still , and the hiv epidemic brought down the countries like this .
so this is what happens in the world , if we play the entire world .
and that means united states was richer , but lost more kids than india is doing today , proportionally .
and here we go . here we go .
i think it 's the best way of verifying historical statistics .
there is no one who has done it so far .
and how do they live ?
it 's about having food .
in 50 years they 've gone from a pre-medieval situation to a very decent 100-year-ago europe , with a functioning nation and state .
or if you are a teacher , you 'll love unesco , and so on .
and that 's good , it gets two plusses .
can i request a moment of absolute silence ?
one is called bidwell training center ; it is a vocational school for ex-steel workers and single parents and welfare mothers .
so , from that fountain i built this building .
that happens to be at christmas time .
because the students made puff pastry and that 's what the school ate every day .
we train corporate travel agents for the travel industry .
we have ceramics and photography and computer imaging .
because now it 's become socially not acceptable not to show up to support your children at the manchester craftsmen 's guild because people think you 're bad parents .
we got it just done in time to show you , so it 's kind of the world debut of our digital imaging center .
and i recorded it and we won something called a grammy .
and that 's the building , and that 's the model , and on the right 's a high-tech greenhouse and in the middle 's the medical technology building .
i had a chance to buy this whole industrial park -- which is less than 1,000 feet from the riverfront -- for four million dollars and i didn 't do it .
he said , " san francisco . "
and all i 've got is a box of slides . "
i believe in you .
but today i 'm going to talk to you about something you can 't see -- what 's going on up in that little brain of hers .
a six-monther adores the task .
and what we 've learned is that babies are sensitive to the statistics , and the statistics of japanese and english are very , very different .
mandarin speaker : [ mandarin ] pk : so what have we done to their little brains ?
so this is little emma .
how does it work ?
and then the government sat on it and used it for political leverage on moi , who was the richest man -- still is the richest man -- in kenya .
keep shoot ' n . keep shoot ' n .
and there was two journalists involved that clearly weren 't insurgents because that 's their full-time job .
j not that we have seen with anything we have released .
should they come forward , that would be a tricky situation for us , but we 're presumably acting in such a way that people feel morally compelled to continue our mission , not to screw it up .
so under that basis , we put it out and said , " look , we 're skeptical about this thing .
so help us understand a bit about you personally and how you came to do this .
j yeah . and you know , i 'm a combative person , so i 'm not actually so big on the nurture , but some way -- there is another way of nurturing victims , which is to police perpetrators of crime .
i mean , there 's enormous pressures to harmonize freedom of speech legislation and transparency legislation around the world -- within the e.u. , between china and the united states .
so like , you can 't feed cows their own brains or you get mad cow disease , and inbreeding and incest and , let 's see , what 's the other one ?
all right .
and today , we hope to convince you that now we are actually able to activate a memory in the brain at the speed of light .
sr : so here is what the hippocampus looks like after forming a fear memory , for example .
we are trying to shoot lasers into the brain .
are we going to bring back the fear memory for the first box into this completely new environment ?
ever since the publication of our work , we 've been receiving numerous comments from all over the internet .
so what would happen here if , while the animal is recalling the memory of the blue box , we gave it a couple of mild foot shocks ?
these are the questions that should not remain just inside the lab , and so one goal of today 's talk was to bring everybody up to speed with the kind of stuff that 's possible in modern neuroscience , but now , just as importantly , to actively engage everybody in this conversation .
and one of the major things we can do we 've talked a bit about here today is moving the curve to the left .
well it 's no secret that computers , through moore 's law , are speeding up faster and faster .
and maybe this will encourage people to get colonoscopies that wouldn 't have otherwise .
and these are being augmented even by our devices again today .
and i would argue , in the future , we 'll have wearable devices in our clothes , monitoring ourselves 24 / 7 .
and these devices are getting smaller and going into more and more of these patients .
and they 're going to be wirelessly telemetered again to your mobile devices so you can go places and be monitored remotely .
what are we going to do with hundred-dollar genomes ?
we 're going to be predictive ; we 're going to know what you 're likely to have .
we also have adult stem cells throughout our body .
so by leveraging these technologies together , i think we 'll enter a new era that i like to call stage 0 medicine .
there 's not too many brain-dead people creating art .
there 's something called bold imaging , which is blood oxygen level dependent imaging .
and so , i have here what we call the " paradigms . "
they do a whole host of things that have to do with self-reflection , introspection , working memory and so forth .
mike pope : this is a pretty good representation of what it 's like .
mos def : ... brown skin i be , standing five-ten i be rockin ' it when i be , in your vicinity whole-style synergy , recognize symmetry go and try to injure me , broke ' em down chemically ain 't the number 10 mc , talk about how been i be styled it like kennedy , late like a 10 to three when i say when i be , girls say bend that key cut cl : and so there 's a lot of analogy between what takes place in free-style rap and jazz .
creatively speaking , it 's just a phenomenal thing .
and it 's not just computation .
in 1950s they were shrinking vacuum tubes , making them smaller and smaller . they finally hit a wall ; they couldn 't shrink the vacuum tube any more and keep the vacuum .
and the cost of a transistor cycle , which is a measure of the price performance of electronics , comes down about every year .
some critics say , " oh , well software is stuck in the mud . "
it 's backed by nasa and google , and other leaders in the high-tech and science community .
so there 's a critical window of opportunity we have to make an important difference that can affect the lives of literally millions of people , and practice preventive medicine on a global scale .
when the commissioner of police comes on tv to talk about crime , he isn 't speaking about corruption .
and some of the largest projects in the country were being constructed through government-to-government arrangements with some of the leading countries in the world , the united states and britain and france and so on and so on .
i 'm going to have my own lexicon speaking here today .
the entire project cost about 1.6 billion dollars , trinidad and tobago dollars , and in fact , we had a lot of bid-rigging and suspicious activity , corrupt activity took place .
now , the previous two examples i gave were to do with construction sector corruption , okay ?
it 's interesting to parallel how the nigerian experience has -- how they 've treated it , and they 've treated it very well compared to us .
and i 'll relate the questions to you in the short form with the reply , so you could understand , as i said , where we are .
fantastic .
but i want to step back from the trinidad and tobago context and bring something new to the table in terms of an international example .
it seems to me that there is this latent potential everywhere , all around us .
for example , in oceanography , a lexicon of dolphin language is actually being created by basically visualizing the sonar beams that the dolphins emit .
and if we kind of ponder on that , then perhaps cymatics had an influence on the formation of the universe itself .
and they say in their discussion that this is very likely because freaks get published .
and i 'm a very nerdy doctor , so i read all of the studies that i could on this drug . i read the one study that was published that showed that reboxetine was better than placebo , and i read the other three studies that were published that showed that reboxetine was just as good as any other antidepressant , and because this patient hadn 't done well on those other antidepressants , i thought , well , reboxetine is just as good . it 's one to try .
if i flipped a coin 100 times but then withheld the results from you from half of those tosses , i could make it look as if i had a coin that always came up heads .
and so then the international committee of medical journal editors came along , and they said , oh , well , we will hold the line .
i grew up in a musical family .
ladies and gentlemen : the lxd .
i 'd like to show you a video of some of the models i work with .
so without the controversy , that 's cool thing number one .
these systems are really hard to build , but we 're just starting to be able to get there , and so , watch out .
now , in one sense , the claim that history has a direction is not that controversial .
with the invention of writing , you start getting cities . this is blurry . i kind of like that because it makes it look like a one-celled organism and reminds you how many levels organic organization has already moved through to get to this point . and then you get to , you know , you get empires .
but there 's a more fundamental reason that it 's not intrinsically upbeat , because a non-zero-sum game , all it tells you for sure is that the fortunes will be correlated for better or worse .
more and more , it 's possible for grassroots hatred abroad to manifest itself in the form of organized violence on american soil .
that is to say -- -- thank you , thank you . that is to say , remember : my whole view of morality is that it boils down to self-interest .
i mean , you want to hear the reason , but you don 't want to be able to relate to it .
but before doing that , i just briefly want to remind you about what you already know : that our genomes , our genetic material , are stored in almost all cells in our bodies in chromosomes in the form of dna , which is this famous double-helical molecule .
and what you can then also begin to do is to say , " how are these genetic differences distributed across the world ? "
and it 's a lot : 38 million variable positions .
there were other forms of humans around , most famously perhaps , neanderthals -- these robust forms of humans , compared to the left here with a modern human skeleton on the right -- that existed in western asia and europe since several hundreds of thousands of years .
this may also be surprising because the neanderthals were never in china .
they meet neanderthals , mix with them , continue to spread over the world , and somewhere in southeast asia , they meet denisovans and mix with them and continue on out into the pacific .
why do we call it that ?
the united states has to access that battle space instantaneously .
the state department over here says , " come on boy , i know you can make it . "
but we have trouble accessing our outcomes .
we argue about it every time we use it .
i 'll do it on tuesday . it will cost you 20 billion dollars . "
talk to anybody who was over there in the first six months .
i 'll walk this dog right through that six part series on the balkans .
jessica lynch never planned on shooting back .
empire is about the enforcement of not just minimal rule sets , which you cannot do , but maximum rule sets which you must do .
we connected national security to international security with about a seven minute time delay .
but i know this organization doesn 't change until it experiences failure .
but here 's the promise you make to the american public , to your own people , to the world .
the force on the right 's going to obliterate it .
last slide .
here 's the dirty secret of the air force , you can win by bombing .
how are you going to get them to work for this force ?
apart from the intrinsic value of the biology and mineralogy and geo-microbiology that we do there , we 're also using these as templates for figuring out how to go look for life on other planets .
and when it became a landscape , it also became a destination , and altered , really , the course of my life .
so , what about life on mars ?
so , we know that it 's probably quite cryptic .
it 's a very simple trick , and i never fail to do it when i 'm sitting in a window seat .
in fact , there 's so much energy available for biology in this cave , that there 's actually a huge number of cavefish .
and these organisms , because they 're very separate from the surface , make a vast array of novel compounds .
these are hopping microbot swarms .
did it start there and get transported here ?
how many of you have iphones ?
and i can keep standing here for the 12 minutes and 53 seconds that i have left and make fun of all sorts of ways we manage money , and at the end you 're going to ask , " how can we help people ? "
take out those who say they save too little .
the same people that imagined themselves eating the bananas ended up eating chocolates a week later .
you will decide whether you want to donate your organs or not .
so we 've chatted about a couple of behavioral challenges .
if people frame mentally saving for retirement as a loss , they 're not going to be saving for retirement .
saving more today is not an option .
if you think about people spending a thousand dollars a year on lottery tickets , we need to think about that .
and it 's interesting how so much of what we 're talking about tonight is not simply design but interaction design .
and jonathan jones is making it happen .
and there 's this flaubert quote that i love : " i have always tried to live in an ivory tower , but a tide of shit is beating at its walls , threatening to undermine it . "
so when i talk about it , i don 't talk only about video games , which are in a way the purest form of interaction , unadulterated by any kind of function or finality .
dwarf fortress is like the holy grail of this kind of massive multiplayer online game , and in fact the two adams brothers were in reykjavík , and they were greeted by a standing ovation by all the eve online fans .
it 's like , it 's about serenity and it 's about sublime .
time . the way we experience time in video games , as in other forms of interaction design , is really quite amazing .
i don 't want it to be at moma and possessed by moma .
we want to offer people an idea of what they can do about it .
community tools , like text messaging , that can tell you when pollen counts are up or smog levels are rising or a natural disaster is unfolding , can give you the information you need to act in a timely fashion .
it 's no exaggeration to say that the mobile phone may be among the world 's most important technologies .
camera phones , of course , would be fundamental to the project .
earth witness would take this further , linking what you see with what thousands or millions of other people see around the world .
now the first thing that will piss you off , undoubtedly , is that all of us are , in fact , going to die in the 21st century .
this guy is called jim , jim smith , and he looked like this .
and i realized , of course , this dialogue is definitely not occurring in the public at large .
the dying process of those with terminal illness that we 've just seen occurs to younger people .
clearly , people didn 't want us to talk about death , or , we thought that .
the second thing you can say is , " have you spoken to that person about the things that are important to you so that we 've got a better idea of what it is we can do ? "
this is a quote from dame cicely saunders , whom i met when i was a medical student .
marketing creates user groups .
it seems to be magic .
k is a daylight receiver transmitter .
anyway , this project , or this experience , make me start a new project on the design of medicine .
and here you can get the white core .
so the living benches would be exactly like the ball .
so it uses some plants to do this job , selected for their gas-filtering ability .
indeed , this object is a domestic farm , for fishes and green .
so i designed , for an american scientist based in paris , a very stimulative , brain-stimulative office .
and before we have the debate , i 'd like to actually take a show of hands -- on balance , right now , are you for or against this ?
and if it isn 't easily gotten , we 'll go ahead and steal it .
they 've run out of good sites .
they 're incredibly safe , weapons proliferation-proof and all the rest of it .
the high is the average of 103 scientific , peer-reviewed studies .
now if you consider the fact that nuclear weapons proliferation is associated with nuclear energy proliferation , because we know for example , india and pakistan developed nuclear weapons secretly by enriching uranium in nuclear energy facilities .
now if we go to the area , lots is worse than nuclear or wind .
nuclear , the time lag alone will allow the arctic to melt and other places to melt more .
there 's plenty of solar and wind .
and we have not had the other side of the argument fully aired so that people can draw their own conclusions .
we 're not going to get enough energy from renewables alone .
and as usual , they had to buy nuclear power from france .
and all those against .
there are millions and millions of sensors surrounding us today , but there 's still so much we don 't know on a daily basis .
this was hitchhiking small satellites alongside much larger satellites .
now people use these because they get a lot of light , which means less of the noise you see in a low-cost cell phone image .
ok , clap them together , once .
so , let 's take a look .
and i 'm going to try that right now .
kt : how are you doing this ?
so , i want you to just think about it for a moment .
kb : ok , oh . tell them -- actually here 's the thing , answer it , answer it , answer it .
i want you to be aware of the sensations , but don 't say anything until i ask you , and don 't open your eyes until i ask you .
i just touched his back , and i just touched his arm .
just be aware of the pressure .
ok , it worked that time , excellent .
you see , psychokinesis is the paranormal influence of the mind on physical events and processes .
but i want you to take this very seriously .
see the way i knew that , because my name starts with a k also , but his name doesn 't start with a k , it starts with an m.
one , two , three and four .
so , now you don 't know where the spike is , and i don 't know where it is either , ok .
your right hand . is that -- no , ok .
this is your decision , not mine .
thank you .
the first one is the famous one , the printing press : movable type , oil-based inks , that whole complex of innovations that made printing possible and turned europe upside-down , starting in the middle of the 1400s .
the second big change is that , as all media gets digitized , the internet also becomes the mode of carriage for all other media , meaning that phone calls migrate to the internet , magazines migrate to the internet , movies migrate to the internet .
twitter announced the existence of the quake several minutes before the us geological survey had anything up online for anybody to read .
someone who has seen the death of a single child now has nothing to lose .
bundle up the message . send the same message to everybody .
he had said , in january , that he would not sign a bill that granted telecom immunity for possibly warrantless spying on american persons .
it is more and more often a way of creating an environment for convening and supporting groups .
but psychographics really haven 't had a huge impact on the media business .
so when you look online at the way people aggregate , they don 't aggregate around age , gender and income .
of course , old media companies and advertisers need to know this .
that was hilarious .
and so i was in the second round of competition , and then the third and the fourth .
she didn 't realize that she stepped on a sensitive nerve and aroused national questioning , almost a turmoil , against the credibility of red cross .
that could pose a potential danger to the society , but who knows ; we 're in a globalized world , so they can look for girlfriends from other countries .
but this whole incident aroused a huge outcry from society about the isolation , both physical and mental , of these migrant workers .
and guess what , we have faked beef .
a father posted his son 's picture onto the internet .
it 's not just the africans that should be concerned about that .
if we can treat hypertension alone in africa , we 'll save 250,000 lives a year . that 's quite significant !
everyone is ready to throw in money , in terms of free money aid to developing countries .
we do not buy unit doses of radiopharmaceuticals .
i can call you in switzerland and say , " listen , go into our system .
which group loses the most weight , we give them prizes .
we 're also starting ancillary health-care technology training programs -- training people in echocardiography , cardiac ultrasound , those kinds of things . now , with that kind of training , it gives people motivation .
every seven years , i close it for one year to pursue some little experiments , things that are always difficult to accomplish during the regular working year .
i likely already look forward to the weekend on thursdays .
and then just leave it all to them .
and i 'll show you a couple of people that did well by pursuing sabbaticals .
i had thought that i should do this without any plan , that this vacuum of time somehow would be wonderful and enticing for idea generation . it was not .
which i understood after i translated it from architecture speech in to regular english , basically as logo making .
you can grow it underneath the skin .
so we got brand new ones , shiny ones , medium ones , and very old , dark ones .
so we asked those guys to do it again .
when i was five years old , i found out that i was engaged to be married as soon as i reached puberty .
teachers looked nice .
and the day before the actual ceremony happens , we were dancing , having excitement , and through all the night we did not sleep .
i met a young gentleman from our village who had been to the university of oregon .
so i had to come up with something to do with the morning , because there 's good news in the morning .
i learned that my mom had a right to own property .
we have .
this is the thing that we are doing , giving them opportunities where they can rise .
but originally the significance of the bindi is to symbolize the third eye between the spiritual world and the religious world .
mumbai-based dhruvi acharya builds on her love of comic books and street art to comment on the roles and expectations of modern indian women .
but i can only hope i 've whet your appetite to go out and see and learn more about the amazing things that are happening in art in india today .
here 's the crux of the obstacle .
but private communities , private , corporate , privatizing communities , are not bottom-up democracies .
in february , he approached the white house , and said , " i would like to fund a prize to create scalable national applications , apps , that will help not only the homeless but those who deliver services [ to ] them to do so better . "
simply throwing data over the transom doesn 't change how government works .
when we start by teaching young people that we live , not in a passive society , a read-only society , but in a writable society , where we have the power to change our communities , to change our institutions , that 's when we begin to really put ourselves on the pathway towards this open government innovation , towards this open government movement , towards this open government revolution .
now when the treasure sank in 2000 , it was the height of the best breeding season scientists had ever recorded for the african penguin -- which at the time , was listed as a threatened species .
up to 1,000 people a day came to the rescue center , and eventually , over the course of this rescue , more than 12 and a half thousand volunteers came from all over the world to cape town to help save these birds .
and luckily , the day they arrived , it was .
so he raced to the lab and made enough to clean the rest of the birds .
so i 'd like to leave you with one final thought and a challenge , if you will .
and that problem is , " how is it so easy to know other minds ? "
they 're mit undergraduates .
and he puts his cheese sandwich over here on top of the pirate chest .
uh-oh . why did he take that one ?
no , because the wind should get in trouble .
so we ask people , how much should grace be blamed in this case , which we call a failed attempt to harm ?
first , i 'm going to show you that this is a magnetic pulse .
getting them wrong and wrong and wrong , and then on careful reconsideration , getting them wrong again . "
the whole research program here of studying the distinctive parts of the human brain is brand new .
and i personally am obsessed with morality .
but i countered , " well men 's brains make this too .
but i 'm also a skeptic .
and now you want me to give up this money and ship it to a stranger ?
so along with colleagues in zurich , we put 200 men on oxytocin or placebo , had that same trust test with money , and we found that those on oxytocin not only showed more trust , we can more than double the number of people who sent all their money to a stranger -- all without altering mood or cognition .
he said we 're social creatures , so we share the emotions of others .
so we 're trying to decide what to do with this , and the phone rings .
so who are these people who manipulate our oxytocin systems ?
and we have testosterone .
her mother was number two .
so there 's tons of ways that we can connect to other people , and it seems to be universal .
the murder happened a little over 21 years ago , january the 18th , 1991 , in a small bedroom community of lynwood , california , just a few miles southeast of los angeles .
sent to prison , adamantly insisting on his innocence , which he has consistently for 21 years .
so all the light in this area from the sun and the moon is what you see on the screen right here .
we had a car that came by , same identical car as described by the teenagers , right ?
i knew that the depth of field was 18 inches or less .
we all have to be very careful .
even worse , with our intention of trying to make buildings move towards a net-zero energy state , we can 't do it just by making mechanical systems more and more efficient .
in addition to that , it can also screen areas for privacy , so that it can differentiate from some of the public areas in the space during different times of day .
there are some drug treatments , but they 're only effective on a small fraction of the population . and so , for the vast majority of patients , their best hope for regaining sight is through prosthetic devices .
and then the transducer then makes the output cells send the code on up to the brain , and the result is a retinal prosthetic that can produce normal retinal output .
can we reconstruct what the retina was seeing from the responses from the firing patterns ?
anyway , it was a time when i was mainly interested in collecting imaginary stories .
so , i started to write computer programs that study very , very large sets of these online footprints .
this provides a slightly more statistical look at things .
and that 's led me to doing some work with the physical world , not with the internet , and only using the internet at the very last moment , as a presentation medium .
they have colors . what do they look like ?
so here i am sleeping on the airplane heading up to alaska .
so what i 'm going to tell you about next is a very new thing . it 's not even a project yet .
i took pictures of everybody 's hands , because i think you can often tell a lot about somebody from how their hands look . i took a portrait of everybody , and asked everybody to make a funny face .
there are these terrifyingly huge indian trucks that come careening around one-lane roads with two-lane traffic , with 3,000-foot drop-offs right next to the road , and he was driving one of these trucks .
a 75-year-old farmer . she was selling oranges on the side of the road .
jh : yeah , but -- yeah , ok . do you hope -- would you prefer to live in the cave for 40 years , or to live for one year ?
he did it because he couldn 't afford a car , but also because he knew how to build one .
well first of all , because i am a maker .
so jordan 's main form of innovation was to take an experiment created in a well-equipped lab at the university and recreate it in a garage in chicago using only cheap materials and tools he made himself .
beau lotto : so , this game is very simple .
now if perception is grounded in our history , it means we 're only ever responding according to what we 've done before .
right ? it 's adaptable to change . right ? it opens possibility , and it 's cooperative . it 's actually how we do our social bonding , and it 's intrinsically motivated . what that means is that we play to play . play is its own reward .
amy o 'toole : thank you , beau . we thought that it was easy to see the link between humans and apes in the way that we think , because we look alike .
student : there 's two up there .
" i 'm afraid the paper fails our initial quality control checks in several different ways . "
curiosity , interest , innocence and zeal are the most basic and most important things to do science .
what 's the point ? the point is what science does for us .
for the last 40 years , i have seen almost the same faces for kings and presidents ruling us -- old , aged , authoritarian , corrupt situations -- regimes that we have seen around us .
the intelligence agencies wanted to arrest people .
and then people started to feel that there 's something new happening .
fortunately , people right now cannot be deceived .
the stability and security of authoritarian regimes cannot create but terrorism and violence and destruction .
you are witnessing change in history .
thank you so much .
i worked after for an investment bank .
you must stop . stop .
it was necessary for us to transform our land into a national park .
but there is another part that we must together rebuild , to build our societies , our modern family of societies , we are at a point where we cannot go back .
the trees are the hair of our planet .
we can apply it everywhere around the world , no ?
and then think about this : why can 't i get a cell phone signal in san francisco ?
what did they do with this ?
during this 60-hour siege on mumbai , 10 men armed not just with weapons , but with technology , were able to bring a city of 20 million people to a standstill .
many of you will remember this super cute video from the last ted , but not all quadcopter swarms are so nice and cute .
the technologies are allowing bigger printers .
there are people already working on hacking the software of life , and while most of them are doing this to great good and to help us all , some won 't be .
how will we protect them in the future ?
or , controversially , and not without its risks , what happens if we just gave it to the whole public ?
so i invite you to join me .
you can 't not know who you are , so you cling to hard-matter identity .
ideas get shorter . they become sound bytes .
they have a fierceness and a freedom that i believe is the bedrock of a new paradigm .
so she really struggled with this , what to do , because she was a senior and she was doing well in her school and she was threatened expulsion . so what she did is she got all her friends together -- i believe it was 100 , 150 students all wore " i love my vagina " t-shirts , and the boys wore " i love her vagina " t-shirts to school .
not running from loss , but entering grief , surrendering to sorrow .
eve ensler : you know , i think carl jung once said that in order to survive the twentieth century , we have to live with two existing thoughts , opposite thoughts , at the same time .
now , if i compare that to a cotton towel that i can use a thousand times , i don 't have a whole lot of embodied energy until i wash that yogurty towel .
so first , we demolish it .
and so the question is : how could we make that back ?
cc : a-rhythm-etic . audience : a-rhythm-etic .
and listen to this .
aha .
there is no other reason to have a brain .
how well are we doing determining what piece to move where ?
there is no generalization at all from one task to another in robotics .
forget about trying to hit the bull 's eye in darts , just aim for the same spot over and over again .
and the key idea to bayesian inference is you have two sources of information from which to make your inference .
now i wouldn 't tell you all this if it wasn 't that a few years ago , we showed this is exactly what people do when they learn new movement skills .
now i get an extra source of sensory information due to that external act .
and we replay that to the other hand with a time delay .
they predict the sensory consequences and subtract it off .
so it really suggests , when you 're doing this -- based on this study and others we 've done -- that the brain is canceling the sensory consequences and underestimating the force it 's producing .
so why is it that we move the particular ways we do ?
and one intuition to get is actually the amount of noise or variability i show here gets bigger as the force gets bigger .
and it uses it very differently once you think about it that way .
and we put an inexpensive , wireless data reader inside the receptacle so they could communicate .
i 'm going to talk to you today about the design of medical technology for low resource settings .
those machines go the proverbial junkyard .
because her machine doesn 't work when there 's no power .
and the mixture that the patient inhales needs to be at least a certain percentage oxygen or else it can become dangerous .
it 's also designed for the environment that it will be used in .
so i 've talked a lot about anesthesia , and i tend to do that .
so i want to share with you a couple key insights about complexity we 're learning from studying nature that maybe are applicable to other problems .
when you see a diagram like this , i don 't want you to be afraid .
this next song is a song that started out as a dream -- a childhood dream .
it 's called " tidying up art " and it 's , as you can see , it 's more or less a picture book .
and i would like to show you here my tidied up version of this picture .
but i can see in your faces that you 're still a little bit skeptical .
yeah , it 's a -- this one here , that 's much better .
and here , that 's one of my favorites .
so now i 've been able to tidy up pictures that i 've wanted to tidy up for a long time .
of course , they 're not gone . they 're all here .
and fortunately , my brazilian friends were more than ready to help .
now there 's a couple -- there 's a couple of lessons that you can take from this .
this was a visualization done by fernando viegas and martin wattenberg , two amazing visualization designers , who looked at a weekend 's worth of twitter traffic and essentially found that a lot of these trending topics were basically segregated conversations -- and in ways that you wouldn 't expect .
it turns out that in many cases atoms are much more mobile than bits .
there are parts of the world that are very , very well connected .
and that 's basically what our media is about .
for six years , i 've been hanging out with these guys .
now the trick with this is that i 'm guessing most people here don 't speak malagasy .
when we look for information online , we basically have two strategies .
i can ask her what to read .
dhani jones , who is the middle linebacker for the cincinnati bengals , has a slightly different approach to the off-season .
and we need to figure out how to cultivate xenophiles .
lord and lady rigor mortis were nibbling on the tarmac , and then the gun went off and all the girlies started running , and all the mummies went , " run ! run chlamydia ! run ! "
here we go .
so the problem is , nowadays , with modern man — — when we feel in danger , we still fill up with our own chemical but because we can 't kill traffic wardens — — or eat estate agents , the fuel just stays in our body over and over , so we 're in a constant state of alarm , a constant state . and here 's another thing that happened .
but we feel as though there are times when a lot of us -- you know what i 'm say 'n ?
now with the allocation and the understanding of the lack of understanding , we enter into a new era of science in which we feel nothing more than so much so as to say that those within themselves , comporary or non-comporary , will figuratively figure into the folding of our non-understanding and our partial understanding to the networks of which we all draw our source and conclusions from .
and then i struggled , because i was thinking to myself , " what should i talk ? what should i do ? it 's a ted audience .
my simple idea is that what 's happened is , the real 21st century around us isn 't so obvious to us , so instead we spend our time responding rationally to a world which we understand and recognize , but which no longer exists .
it 's scary . my friend and mentor , tim brown of ideo , he explains that design must get big , and he 's right .
and then add to that , every time you tweet , over a third of your followers follow from a country which is not your own .
all the rules are gone . in that environment , instantly , all the possibilities which turbulence brings are available , and it 's not the same as laminar .
the answer is , don 't do things which are different .
a third of the jewish population stayed in babylonia .
in fact , the current dynamic that you see between iran and israel has its roots more so in the geopolitical reconfiguration of the region after the cold war than in the events of 1979 , because at this point , iran and israel emerge as two of the most powerful states in the region , and rather than viewing each other as potential security partners , they increasingly came to view each other as rivals and competitors .
when iran and israel 's security imperatives dictated collaboration , they did so in spite of lethal ideological opposition to each other .
so a plague outbreak in surat , india becomes not an obscure event , but a globalized event -- a globalized concern that has changed the risk equation .
but nobody believes it will actually be particularly effective if we have a real outbreak .
alright , so i 've got you nervous .
the rest is up to your local community .
well then what about all the workers ? they won 't go to work if their kids aren 't in school .
and tamiflu . you 've probably heard of this drug , made by hoffmann-la roche , patented drug .
the pandemic circulated three times in 18 months in the absence of commercial air travel .
the institute of medicine study felt that you could not recycle masks .
happy to take your questions .
we have absolutely no idea what that would do .
again we don 't really know for sure .
and i think my time is up . i thank you all for your attention .
and he had a platform where you linked information to other information , and then you could call it up at will .
and my company , owl built a system called guide for the apple macintosh .
and he tried to persuade me to write the browser for it , because his system didn 't have any graphics or fonts or layout or anything ; it was just plain text .
much later , as a student , i went to a very different garden , a zoological garden in arnhem where we keep chimpanzees .
so we have this image in political science , economics , the humanities , philosophy for that matter , that man is a wolf to man .
and so they 're bringing in the box .
and if you pull on this side of the rope , the rope disappears on the other side .
this was the cooperation , reciprocity part .
also , we know that people who have a lot of yawn contagion are highly empathic .
and we call them into a room and do experiments with them .
so this is the 50 percent line that 's the random expectation .
so that 's the experiment we did .
they didn 't like this at all .
so this difference first came to me in some ways in my dual role at columbia university , where i 'm both a professor and run a laboratory in neuroscience where we try to figure out how the brain works .
nonetheless , this is what i think we were leaving out of our courses and leaving out of the interaction that we have with the public as scientists , the what-remains-to-be-done .
in 2006 , there were 1.3 million papers published .
so peel by peel , you take away the layers of the onion to get at some fundamental kernel of truth .
sometimes we call them bull sessions .
knowing a lot of stuff , the purpose is to be able to ask lots of questions , to be able to frame thoughtful , interesting questions , because that 's where the real work is .
you ask them to go up an inclined plane , and they fall over .
i like to quote because i think dead people shouldn 't be excluded from the conversation .
is this what we want ?
so let me end with a quote from william butler yeats , who said " education is not about filling buckets ; it is lighting fires . "
so , then , we understand that if we want to change our trajectory , in life , or in the balloon , we have to change altitude .
explore this vertical axis , that means explore all the different ways to do , all the different ways to behave , all the different ways to think , before we find the one that goes in the direction we wish .
and he told me , " don 't do that . go down immediately in order to slow down . "
that 's when you throw out all the ballast , all the certainties , in order to adapt to the new situation .
and i think it 's a nice metaphor also for the 21st century .
and with 200 square meters of solar power on our plane , we can produce the same energy than 200 little lightbulbs .
and there , there will be just one goal , just one : reach the next sunrise before the batteries are empty .
it leaves 25 or 30 percent for oil , gas , coal , nuclear , or whatever .
then you don 't need anything to control the car , except thinking about it .
50 percent of the global population now lives in cities .
it 's not sustainable .
we thought it would be really neat to do that , and one of the problems we really were worried about is : how do we get legal on the sidewalk ?
and so i said , " sure . "
we 've got to start building cities and human environments where a 150-pound person can go a couple of miles in a dense , rich , green-space environment , without being in a 4,000-pound machine to do it .
if you wanted to boil water and re-condense it at a rate of 10 gallons an hour , it takes about 25 , a little over 25.3 kilowatt -- 25,000 watts of continuous power -- to do it .
for this reason , the majority of theoretical physicists believe that the higgs boson could not be the full story .
just like matter can exist as liquid or solid , so the higgs field , the substance that fills all space-time , could exist in two states .
and experiments at the lhc found that the mass of the higgs boson is about 126 gev .
and indeed , a possible answer to my question opens up new universes , literally .
everywhere i went , i felt at home .
now to put this into a broader context , i want you to imagine that you are an eternal alien watching the earth from outer space , and your favorite show on intergalactic satellite television is the earth channel , and your favorite show is the human show .
and what i 've learned since that event and during my recovery is that consciousness is under threat on this planet in ways it 's never been under threat before .
so what you 'd be wondering , watching the human show , is are we going to confront and address the catastrophic climate shift that may be heading our way by growing our consciousness , or are we going to continue to retreat ?
here 's my brain .
in the health care system , if you touch average , you 're done .
and with accommodation , they went on to college and had a full life in terms of their opportunities .
if you press on a hose pipe in a sealed system , it bulges someplace else .
so it goes in and it stays there .
thank you very much .
and what i would love to add because i didn 't have time ...
you 'd think , there 's plenty of paralyzed people in the world , but the audience is too small , and the amount of research , the time it takes , the fda clearances , the payback time is too long for v.c. to be interested .
well , when you design an object that 's supposed to interact with a human being , if you make a foam model of a mobile phone , it doesn 't make any sense .
the documentation and the hands-on teaching methodology is also open-source and released as the creative commons .
mr : our producers caught up with kim kardashian earlier today to find out what she was planning on wearing to her — mb : eh ?
he 's 14 and he anticipated a governmental project by one year .
also , i come from italy , and the design is important in italy , and yet very conservative .
i mean , how must you feel when you read this stuff and you see what you 've unlocked ?
because real science is all about critically appraising the evidence for somebody else 's position .
you get a certificate and everything .
so you go and find the paper , and what you find is an observational study .
they were taking 3,000 children , they were going to give them all these huge fish oil pills , six of them a day , and then a year later , they were going to measure their school exam performance and compare their school exam performance against what they predicted their exam performance would have been if they hadn 't had the pills .
but that 's not enough .
and so you 're bound to make your new drug look better .
the big trials are closer to the true answer .
the nordic cochrane group were trying to get a hold of the data on that to bring it all together .
and also , i talked to friends about china and chinese internet .
that 's the biggest digital boundary in the whole world .
on the one hand , he wants to satisfy people 's need of a social network , which is very important ; people really love social networking .
right after the train crash , authorities literally wanted to cover up the train , bury the train .
chinese is always cheating , right ?
so your sad stories , by some chance your story will be picked up by reporters , professors or celebrities .
for example , anything you want to post , like " get together " or " meet up " or " walk , " it is automatically recorded and data mined and reported to a poll for further political analyzing .
so this kind of freedom is a targeted and precise window .
sopa , pipa , acta , tpp and itu .
most of you are familiar with portobello mushrooms .
this is photomicrographs from nick read and patrick hickey .
i believe matter begets life ; life becomes single cells ; single cells become strings ; strings become chains ; chains network .
and these existed for tens of millions of years .
we came back to our pile , it was covered with hundreds of pounds of oyster mushrooms , and the color changed to a light form .
so , this one mushroom , in particular , has drawn our interest over time .
and so , for the first time , i am showing this .
now after sporulation , the spores repel .
then you harvest the seeds -- and thank you , eric rasmussen , for your help on this -- and then you 're harvesting the seed garden .
we got reports like this .
how do you decide what is important ?
from young , smart developers .
it was six miles offshore and 1,250 feet down .
no matter where on earth you live .
consider this : starting right here at the convention center , we can find the nearby aquarium , we can look at where we 're sitting , and then we can cruise up the coast to the big aquarium , the ocean , and california 's four national marine sanctuaries , and the new network of state marine reserves that are beginning to protect and restore some of the assets we can flit over to hawaii and see the real hawaiian islands : not just the little bit that pokes through the surface , but also what 's below .
we 're putting hundreds of millions of tons of plastic and other trash into the sea .
there are a few oysters in chesapeake bay .
such as the arctic -- we have one chance , right now , to get it right .
and so , i suppose you want to know what my wish is .
but after four years the grim truth seeps out .
and she spoke some vietnamese , as a child having grown up with vietnamese friends .
last year , the khmer rouge tribunal , which the u.n. is helping cambodia take on , started , and i decided that as a matter of record i should file a civil complaint with the tribunal about my father 's passing away .
and at some point the dutch police came into amsterdam and arrested van meegeren .
and he killed himself soon afterwards .
so i want to suggest that pleasure is deep -- and that this isn 't true just for higher level pleasures like art , but even the most seemingly simple pleasures are affected by our beliefs about hidden essences .
everybody , of course , drinks exactly the same wine .
but there 's at least one case where capgras syndrome had a happy ending .
so in one of our experiments , we asked people to name a famous person who they adored , a living person they adored .
the original is typically the product of a creative act , the forgery isn 't .
not bad . it 's also not good .
there 's no malevolence , they 're just pressing a button .
and i grew up in this little farming town in northern nevada .
and then i started conducting , and i ended up doing my master 's degree at the juilliard school .
afterwards , i played a piano track underneath so that the singers would have something to listen to .
this is " lux aurumque " sung by the virtual choir .
beau awtin : safe in bed ew : and our goal -- it was sort of an arbitrary goal -- there was an mtv video where they all sang " lollipop " and they got people from all over the world to just sing that little melody .
as i am in the great alaskan bush , satellite is my connection to the world . "
the question of transformation in africa really is a question of leadership .
and so three months later , just before she returned to the united states , nurses in accra go on strike .
no sign to this effect .
they wanted us to be concerned about social issues .
and those leaders did not emerge spontaneously .
and it was the same -- learning by rote -- from primary school through graduate school .
but i was moved almost to tears because i understood what was happening to this young man .
it says a lot about the culture that 's forming on campus .
one day in 1819 , 3,000 miles off the coast of chile , in one of the most remote regions of the pacific ocean , 20 american sailors watched their ship flood with seawater .
it 's easiest to see this link between fear and the imagination in young children , whose fears are often extraordinarily vivid .
but they knew that the sheer length of this journey would stretch their supplies of food and water .
and humans , by the way , are the only creatures capable of thinking about the future in this way , of projecting ourselves forward in time , and this mental time travel is just one more thing that fears have in common with storytelling .
after much deliberation , the men finally made a decision .
properly read , our fears can offer us something as precious as our favorite works of literature : a little wisdom , a bit of insight and a version of that most elusive thing -- the truth .
there 's also a fascinating connection to cancer here , because people with neurologic diseases have a very low incidence of most cancers .
i want to take something rather humble to discuss .
chairs : recycled and recyclable .
if you can see this orange tree , it 's actually growing in a car tire , which has been turned inside out and sewn up .
i don 't know how many worms [ were ] in there , but i 've got some heavy karma coming , i tell you .
in the canal , which is just outside the restaurant , there is hundreds of meters of coil piping .
i 've kept the tiles ; i 've kept the floors ; i 've kept the trunking ; i 've got in some recycled fridges ; i 've got some recycled tills ; i 've got some recycled trolleys .
i 'm here today to show my photographs of the lakota .
what is known as the bureau of indian affairs was created within the war department , setting an early tone of aggression in our dealings with the native americans .
1871 : the indian appropriation act makes all indians wards of the federal government .
reservations are cut up into 160-acre sections and distributed to individual indians with the surplus disposed of .
they were tired of treaties .
the tuberculosis rate on pine ridge is approximately eight times higher than the u.s. national average .
is any of this your responsibility today ?
if you look at all the world religions , all the main world religions , you 'll find within them some teaching concerning compassion .
so part of compassion has to be an understanding of what makes people tick .
the idea of justice , which gives boundaries to our lives and gives us a feeling of what 's right about life , what 's right about living , what should we be doing , social justice .
what does it mean , " dough becomes leaven " ?
he goes to the ark . he opens the ark .

i am lucky to have her .
all of us have disabilities in one form or another .
are you excited to be at tedxmidatlantic ?
and i realized how few of the grown-ups that i knew were able to withstand the tragedies that the war visited on them -- how few of them could even resemble a normal , contented , satisfied , happy life once their job , their home , their security was destroyed by the war .
and to start those studies about 40 years ago , i began to look at creative people -- first artists and scientists , and so forth -- trying to understand what made them feel that it was worth essentially spending their life doing things for which many of them didn 't expect either fame or fortune , but which made their life meaningful and worth doing .
but actually , our nervous system is incapable of processing more than about 110 bits of information per second .
but it happens in other activities .
and two things that we measure is the amount of challenge people experience at that moment and the amount of skill that they feel they have at that moment .
so the question we are trying to address -- and i 'm way over time -- is how to put more and more of everyday life in that flow channel .
i loved that i could hide within this shadow my own painted version , and it would be almost invisible until the light changed , and all of a sudden my shadow would be brought to the light .
i 'd put something down , and instantly it would be gone .
you are the reason why i said yes to the invitation to come here today .
it means the netherlands is a peaceful country .
their grim plans were evident .
they liberated my birth town .
or is there something else ?
and this is exactly why failed states are so dangerous .
they put their lives on the line , for us , for you , and we cannot let them down .
and the blue line is the ratio of american to chinese .
this is not a new question .
this must be true because a scotsman said it .
one , competition .
that 's what makes the difference between north america and south america .
japan was the first non-western society to embrace it .
why ?
but i don 't think his studio has been rebuilt .
he was an expert in latin american history .
and that is bread -- something which is as simple as our basic , most fundamental human staple .
this is an image from tuscany , where we feel agriculture is still about beauty .
and it means that you now eat products , which can come from all around the world .
that is , historically , a really unique situation .
and this is where i have to query all of you .
it 's a luxury solution for us who can afford it , if you want to afford it .
we must feed three billion people in cities .
we do not need to spill the water if we don 't want to .
you must go back and think about your own food chain .
let me share some of the food with you .
new parents are astonished by the rapidity of this learning .
the children must be woken at 7 and fed at 7 : 30 .
this state of affairs is neither necessary nor is it inevitable .
you 're never , there 's just , juxtapositions are possible that just aren 't , you don 't think they 're going to happen .
they don 't really go to the usual place that memories go .
it 's like i gave you a new car and you 're complaining about not finding parking .
so my point is , there 's a lot of struggle has gone in europe , where citizens were empowered by technologies .
recently " the economist " recognized this , but i stumbled upon the idea 12 years ago , and that 's what i 've been working on .
and after all , poor countries , like rich countries , one thing we 've got equal , is their days are the same length : 24 hours .
but then we are limiting our economic sphere to something very small area .
and also people told me that we have a lot of important primary needs to meet : food , clothing , shelter , whatever .
and she sells the milk to the villagers , and pays off the loan .
and these phones are generating about 100 million dollars for the company .
most of them learn how to operate a telephone within a day .
what then happens is not an across-the-board reduction in all your mental capacities , a sort of blunting of your cognitive ability .
when you 're a little baby , a young baby , you had a strong sexual attraction to your mother .
i talked about that earlier .
it 's some strange woman pretending to be my mother . "
is it nature , genes , or is it nurture ?
it sounds like an oxymoron .
how do you do that ? well , virtual reality .
now , i said , " move your normal hand and phantom . "
i said , " what ? "
now , this technique has been tried on dozens of patients by other groups in helsinki , so it may prove to be valuable as a treatment for phantom pain , and indeed , people have tried it for stroke rehabilitation .
why would that be ?
so , if there 's a gene causing this trimming and if that gene mutates , then you get deficient trimming between adjacent brain areas .
how many of you think that 's kiki and that 's buba ? raise your hands .
think african governments will put together a conference like this ?
there 's another enduring tragedy , and that tragedy is that there are so many people , so many governments , so many organizations who want to help the people in africa .
every year africa spends 20 billion dollars to import food .
20 out of 204 means that the vast majority of the african leaders failed their people .
the modern sector is the abode of the elites .
these societies are the ibo , the somali , the kikuyus , for example . they have no chiefs .
they decide what to do .
the men are going fishing in these small boats .
i would be willing to bet that i 'm the dumbest guy in the room because i couldn 't get through school . i struggled with school .
if you teach a man to fish , you feed him for a lifetime . "
i have 18 out of the 19 signs of attention deficit disorder diagnosed .
i open up chapter eight talking about budgeting .
because , when i told her i was going out to play with the kids , i was going door to door in the neighborhood to collect coat hangers to put in the basement to sell .
and i said , " this car here 's got one license plate that 's all crumpled up . "
so i would collect the tips and get payment .
and i had these little pillows that i would sew up .
i would carry their golf bags up to the top , and they 'd pay me a dollar .
i packaged them up three ways .
why don 't you teach them not to waste money ?
they walk up with me . every year all the money in the bank goes to their broker .
we have all these lessons in front of us , but we don 't take those opportunities ; we teach kids to go get a tutor .
but how about getting entrepreneurship to be ranked right up there with the rest of them as well ?
there was an important lesson for me in that .
you know , we live in an age where we are so used to television images and photographs , a one-hit image . these were big , complex things , almost like cartoons with multiple narratives .
and in this extraordinary setting , the costumes were like actors and actresses , or living sculptures .
some of them are comfortable . they feel at home .
it postulates a vast and rapidly growing number of universes existing in parallel -- mutually undetectable except through the narrow porthole of quantum mechanical experiments .
if we had , our brains probably would perceive rocks as full of empty space . rocks feel hard and impenetrable to our hands precisely because objects like rocks and hands cannot penetrate each other . it 's therefore useful for our brains to construct notions like " solidity " and " impenetrability , " because such notions help us to navigate our bodies through the middle-sized world in which we have to navigate .
a small insect would reverse these priorities .
we have brains that evolved in medium-sized ancestors which couldn 't walk through rocks .
perhaps dogs and rhinos and other smell-oriented animals smell in color . and the argument would be exactly the same as for the bats .
and when i say quite common , it could still be so rare that no one island of life ever encounters another , which is a sad thought .
or , finally , are there some things in the universe so queer that no philosophy of beings , however godlike , could dream them ?
and so clearly they were criminals because of the way they died .
think about this for a second .
this kind of business model obviously depends entirely on having a very effective brand of fear , and so los zetas carefully stage acts of violence that are spectacular in nature , especially when they arrive first in a city , but again , that 's just a brand strategy .
they have invented drones to transport drugs , catapults , you name it .
i 'll tell you a little bit about irrational behavior .
so i wrote a book on my research .
now , the interesting thing about this is when i take the lines away , it 's as if you haven 't learned anything in the last minute .
we have a huge part of our brain dedicated to vision -- bigger than dedicated to anything else .
and finally , depending on your particular version of european similarity , you can think about the u.k and france as either similar culturally or not .
we wake up in the morning and we open the closet and we feel that we decide what to wear .
i 'll give you one more example for this .
you let them go . or you pull them back .
but what if the option to have your car stolen was not exactly like this .
these are the market share . most people wanted the combo deal .
i showed some people a picture of tom , and a picture of jerry .
in fact in medical terms , that 's our view .
but tod couldn 't come and the project is sort of somewhere , i 'm not sure whether it 's happening the way we thought , or not .
we 're jugglers , ok . and remember , you 're transposing , you 're getting into a subculture here .
well , that 's what juggling is about , right ?
white .
ok ? so , what you 're doing is , you 're going la , la , la , and you 're getting this . ok ?
trying to figure that stuff out . but is it going to get you anywhere ?
there 's a mystery . there 's a mystery in the moment .
now , i 'm going to show you the beginnings of a piece that is about balance in some ways , and also -- oh , actually , if you 're bored , not here , here 's one use for it .
the second influence on this piece came from recycling and looking into a tin can recycling bin and seeing all that beautiful emptiness .
let 's see here .
look how odd he looks with the eyebrows missing .
they say , " how dare you take this child out of the house and terrify other people .
teachers and peers were underestimating her ; she was teased at school .
he enjoyed life to the full , and this was probably because he had a successful , fulfilling job and a caring family and was able to participate socially .
when they have facial surgery , they feel their lives have changed because other people perceive them as better people .
we make judgments on people 's faces all the time .
i now want to share a little bit of the surgery that we do -- where we 're at and where we 're going .
it 's skin from his back .
we 've got mouth cancer to solve .
here 's a map a lawyer made . he put on it the water plant , and which houses are there , which houses have been connected to the water .
and then you can select also other things on the map to see what other factors , like the threat level .
there 's the map showing , on the left-hand side , that hospital -- actually that 's a hospital ship .
you kept moving ahead in a life where you 're dependent on working for somebody .
he 's building this huge concrete place .
how could i have made shapes like that or done stuff like that ? "
nothing that you would call architecture , right ?
did you see that thing ?
you can come to the opening . i 'll invite you .
the mit project -- they were interviewing me for mit and they sent their facilities people to bilbao .
and then what ?
so four of us went .
but let me just say a couple words .
corruption .
and the leader that came to mind was nelson mandela .
now , the thing i remember about siwa was the magical view of the sky at night .
but you could say , " invest in africa in over 1,000 languages , and it wouldn 't make a difference . "
you can make money , you can lose money in africa .
but looking at goldman sachs ' work -- we had the famous bric report .
for africa to truly be sustainable , we have to move beyond to other industries .
but what 's going on there ? only 10 percent of the country is banked .
because in africa today , we are competing globally for capital .
because there are amazing opportunities available .
here is a scanning electron micrograph of a grain of pollen .
cool pollen , though .
and this is where it gets interesting for forensics .
well , this is about state budgets .
receipts go down , some spending programs go up , but most of it is not because of that .
the paper said , " it 's not really balanced .
the forecast for the medical piece alone is to go from 26 percent of the budget to 42 percent .
but with the type of cuts we 're talking about , it will be far , far harder to get these incentives for excellence , or to move over to use technology in the new way .
we need to take the fact that the current employees , the future liabilities they create , that should come out of the current budget .
so this is the first self-replicating species that we 've had on the planet whose parent is a computer .
so once we realized that we could make 5,000-base pair viral-sized pieces , we thought , we at least have the means then to try and make serially lots of these pieces to be able to eventually assemble them together to make this mega base chromosome .
it 's an amazing step forward , but we had a problem because now we had the bacterial chromosomes growing in yeast .
so it took about three months to find that error and repair it .
the first is , " to live , to err , to fall , to triumph and to recreate life out of life . "
so when you see how long it took to get an h1n1 vaccine out , we think we can shorten that process quite substantially .
" enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber . "
and you don 't have sex .
there are dozens of different ideas about why we sleep , and i 'm going to outline three of those .
what 's turned out to be really exciting is that our ability to come up with novel solutions to complex problems is hugely enhanced by a night of sleep .
it 's locked onto the same light-dark cycle as the rest of us .
well , of course , you then resort to alcohol .
therefore , diabetes 2 .
turn off those mobile phones . turn off those computers .
there is no , no evidence that getting up early and going to bed early gives you more wealth at all .
and last year , we published a study which showed that a gene that 's been linked to schizophrenia , which , when mutated , also smashes the sleep .
if you get sleep , it reduces your mood changes , your stress , your levels of anger , your impulsivity , and your tendency to drink and take drugs .
so i said , " well , mom and dad , what about santa claus ?
i just realized that the age of reason starts when you turn seven , and then you 're capable of committing any and all sins against god and man . " and bill said , " so ? " and then i said , " so , you 're six . you have a whole year to do anything you want to and god won 't notice it . " and he said , " so ? " and i said , " so ? so everything ! " and i turned to run . i was so angry with him .
one day , two mormon missionaries came to my door .
he led them to america .
and they said , " no . " and i said , " why ? " and they said , " well , it 's because god gave women a gift that is so spectacular , it is so wonderful , that the only gift he had left over to give men was the gift of prophecy . "
so , i couldn 't let myself feel condescending towards these boys .
we see alien worlds , we see alien solar systems -- 300 now , and still counting -- and they 're not like us .
and actually this tour is one that was created earlier .
here in biosphere 1 , well it takes me about two minutes , because i pick up the phone and i call and say , " hey , can you deliver the pizza ? "
big questions .
in fact , we ate so many sweet potatoes i became orange with sweet potato .
and that you literally do that . you stop breathing and then you -- -- take a breath and it wakes you up . and it 's very irritating .
so at the end of the two years when we came out , we were elated , because , in fact , although you might say we had discovered something that was quite " uhh , " when your oxygen is going down , stopped working , essentially , in your life support system , that 's a very bad failure .
people must have thought i was nuts .
and the mangroves were providing wood and honey and leaves for the animals , so that they could produce milk and whatnot , like we had in the biosphere .
and those beautiful wispy clouds are , in fact , fires , human-made fires .
and i have an oasis .
i want to talk to you about something kind of big .
now , not all asteroids are that big .
now , in 1908 , over siberia , near the tunguska region -- for those of you who are dan aykroyd fans and saw " ghostbusters , " when he talked about the greatest cross-dimensional rift since the siberia blast of 1909 , where he got the date wrong , but that 's okay .
well , what do we do about them ?
-- you can 't plan that kind of stuff -- apophis is going to hit us . and it 's 250 meters across , so it would do unbelievable damage .
if we need , if we see an asteroid that 's coming toward us , and it 's headed right for us , and we have two years to go , boom ! we hit it .
the gravity of the asteroid pulls on the probe , and the probe has a couple of tons of mass .
the difference between the dinosaurs and us is that we have a space program and we can vote , and so we can change our future .
when i finally got to a place in my life where i came out and accepted who i was , and was really quite happy , to tell you the truth , i was happily gay and i guess that 's supposed to be right because gay means happy too .
and after i 'm done cooking and cleaning and standing in line and getting stuck in traffic , my partner and i , we get together and we decide that we 're gonna go and have some wild and crazy fun .
it 's really scary , this gay lifestyle thing ; it 's super duper evil and there 's no end to it !
there it is !
nonetheless , our forefathers , right ?
and that 's not just about me , that 's about so many other michiganders , u.s. citizens , who don 't understand why what they are is so much more significant than who they are .
for example , i get people to dress up their vacuum cleaners .
here 's how the song goes .
in the end , it was one of the top downloads on a whole bunch of music streaming services .
and that 's not always going to happen in physical spaces .
and people called in and left messages like this .
some came from the party who had just lost .
so the nice thing was is he walked by his daughter 's room at some point , and she actually was singing that song to herself .
and so what i decided to do .
most of the information that we collected on the cholera outbreak didn 't come from testing water ; it came from forms like this , which documented all the people we failed to help .
a few months ago , a 40 year-old woman came to an emergency room in a hospital close to where i live , and she was brought in confused .
you might not know that conan doyle went to medical school here in edinburgh , and his character , sherlock holmes , was inspired by sir joseph bell .
such red clay is not found within a hundred miles of edinburgh , except in the botanical gardens .
and , oh yes , if you wanted , he would give you a haircut -- short on the sides , long in the back -- and pull your tooth while he was at it .
when are they going to come by and explain things to me ?
now you and i could argue that they probably did not need to touch her breasts .
and i remember my very first patient in that series continued to tell me more history during what was meant to be the physical exam visit .
we signal transitions of power with rituals .
and as i wondered what he was up to , his stick fingers made their way up to his pajama shirt , fumbling with his buttons .
benjamin wallace : now , that 's about all the videotape that remains of an event that set off the longest-running mystery in the modern wine world .
and it arrived , and it was tiny .
yeah .
thank you .
and then an enzyme in its digestive tract leeches into the beans , and people with the unenviable job of collecting these cats ' leavings then go through the forest collecting the , you know , results and processing it into coffee -- although you actually can buy it in the unprocessed form .
there 's a little plaque on the end that , you know , each buyer gets their name engraved on it .
the ' 47 cheval blanc is probably the most mythologized wine of the 20th century .
there were some people who were a little less impressed .
after this , we noticed a couple of interesting things , which you 'll see .
after that , i started to experiment with various other things that they might learn to do on their own .
as a result , the teachers reported tremendous improvements in their english -- rapid improvement and all sorts of things .
they said , " yes , we did . "
i said , " no , use the method of the grandmother . "
the first group -- the best one -- solved everything in 20 minutes .
teacher : you can 't catch me .
i sent all the teachers away from my group of 10 year-old students .
which is why you react the way you do , because it looks impossible .
and yamaha makes an incredible thing called the disklavier pro that looks like a nice grand piano there .
i 'm going to get very scientific about this , and not use the pedal . "
it 's so involving compared to regular stereo .
all right , there 's this episode of " star trek . "
this morning , you 're sadder , you want to hear your song , the same song , played sadder than you did yesterday .
and fortunately , it 's right in here .
and this polar bear that you see , this 1200-pound male , he 's wild and fairly hungry .
and our committee , which consisted of a lot of hard scientists , did feel at the end of that study that the absence of play and a progressive suppression of developmentally normal play led him to be more vulnerable to the tragedy that he perpetrated .
and -- they don 't throw it at each other , but this is a fundamental part of being playful .
preschool kids , for example , should be allowed to dive , hit , whistle , scream , be chaotic , and develop through that a lot of emotional regulation and a lot of the other social byproducts -- cognitive , emotional and physical -- that come as a part of rough and tumble play .
so it 's -- for me , its been an extremely nourishing scholarly adventure to look at the neuroscience that 's associated with play , and to bring together people who in their individual disciplines hadn 't really thought of it that way .
and i think if you think about life without play -- no humor , no flirtation , no movies , no games , no fantasy and , and , and .
your own personal play history is unique , and often is not something we think about particularly .
we 're about two and a half , three months into it , and it 's really been fun .
john hockenberry : so it sounds to me like what you 're saying is that there may be some temptation on the part of people to look at your work and go -- i think i 've heard this , in my kind of pop psychological understanding of play , that somehow , the way animals and humans deal with play , is that it 's some sort of rehearsal for adult activity .
i mean you don 't hear about anything that 's like cancer or heart disease associated with play .
think of it in terms of drums of water , each containing 200 liters .
now , no livestock were involved , but suspecting that we had too many elephants now , i did the research and i proved we had too many , and i recommended that we would have to reduce their numbers and bring them down to a level that the land could sustain .
we had no understanding of that .
so let 's do that .
our river is flowing and healthy and clean .
but worse than that , it is causing hunger , poverty , violence , social breakdown and war , and as i am talking to you , millions of men , women and children are suffering and dying .
and the amount of time each of us is spending doing all of this is also continuing to go grow .
the blue dots are the sites that i 've actually navigated directly to .
i look at this picture and it freaks me out .
going forward , all of our voices need to be heard .
now light and temperature vary with each window 's microclimate , so a window farm requires a farmer , and she must decide what kind of crops she is going to put in her window farm , and whether she is going to feed her food organically .
so my core team and i are able to concentrate on the improvements that really benefit everyone .
note the textbook , the sage on the stage , and the sleeping guy in the back .
we preferred open-ended questions .
and finally , from teach for america , i learned that a class is not primarily about information .
who was the better man ?
i wrote this poem for her . these are not my beliefs .
don 't do it .
dearest , do i love thee less ?
but which of them reigns supreme ?
at 20 the torch of resentment was lit .
i was in a clinic . i wasn 't allowed to make telephone calls .
oh , we did .
what do i say to them ?
in the northwest corner of the united states , right up near the canadian border , there 's a little town called libby , montana , and it 's surrounded by pine trees and lakes and just amazing wildlife and these enormous trees that scream up into the sky .
vermiculite was used for soil conditioners , to make plants grow faster and better .
but still gayla went on , and finally she succeeded in getting a federal agency to come to town and to screen the inhabitants of the town -- 15,000 people -- and what they discovered was that the town had a mortality rate 80 times higher than anywhere in the united states .
and when i go to germany , they say , " oh yes , this is the german disease . "
and he said , " you know , i 'm not the kind of guy to rat people out , but some things just cross the line .
she had freedom , and she was ready to use it . "
meetings are important , right ?
i was just saying , we have a lot of people on the call we 'd like to get through , so let 's skip the roll call and i 'm gonna dive right in .
a common theme running through all of these comments online is this fundamental belief that we are powerless to do anything other than go to meetings and suffer through these poorly run meetings and live to meet another day .
thank you .
i have never built an atomic pile .
within 12 hours , i was horribly sunburned , just like richard dreyfuss in the movie .
the street was entirely empty .
i remember , she had some sort of injury to her ankle , an ace bandage , and she had crutches .
the sandworms were fine , but your favorite character ?
three : there was a surprisingly long sequence of the film in which the rubber puppet gives christopher walken a rectal probe .
and did i want to come with ?
and that 's when the liberians came along .
but i was skilled at hiding it , and from the outside appeared to be someone with everything to hope for and aspire to .
and i always wish , at this point , the voice had said , " she is digging her own grave . "
now looking back on the wreckage and despair of those years , it seems to me now as if someone died in that place , and yet , someone else was saved .
the voices took the place of this pain and gave words to it , and possibly one of the greatest revelations was when i realized that the most hostile and aggressive voices actually represented the parts of me that had been hurt most profoundly , and as such , it was these voices that needed to be shown the greatest compassion and care .
in this respect , for members of society , there is no greater honor or privilege than facilitating that process of healing for someone , to bear witness , to reach out a hand , to share the burden of someone 's suffering , and to hold the hope for their recovery .
thank you .
and i thought that was the best deal in town , so i accepted it immediately .
if you look at the picture , you 'll see they 're stacked up .
the point being , this is going to be very , very intensive on the programming side .
it was getting its power in a different way . it 's kind of childlike .
and i can race through these and save a lot of time because yves and i obviously didn 't compare notes .
again , when you 're a nonprofit , you look at children as a mission , not as a market .
when it was announced that they were going to do every child in uruguay , the first 100,000 , boom , went to olpc .
i won 't dwell on the pricing at all .
it 's a mental process , and it 's a process of extraction .
and sound places us in time as well , because sound always has time embedded in it .
because listening is our access to understanding .
one , two , three . one , two , three . one , two , three .
i wrote a whole book about it . so i live to listen .
and in an age that is sometimes nowadays frightening or confusing , we feel reassured by the almost parental-like authority of experts who tell us so clearly what it is we can and cannot do .
but what my research has shown me is that experts tend on the whole to form very rigid camps , that within these camps , a dominant perspective emerges that often silences opposition , that experts move with the prevailing winds , often hero-worshipping their own gurus .
what is the evidence upon which this is based ?
by leveraging and by embracing the expertise within the company , best buy was able to discover , for example , that the store that it was going to open in china -- its big , grand store -- was not going to open on time .
how can we make the harmful organisms more mild ?
the whole point is that a person who can 't move can still infect many other individuals .
and it flushes out thousands of different other competitors that would otherwise make life difficult for the vibrios .
so , we don 't want to run an experiment like that .
in every case there 's a lot of variation , but something about the environment the people are living in , and i think the only realistic explanation is that it 's the degree of waterborne transmission , favored the harmful strains in one place , and mild strains in another .
and in chile , you still had antibiotic sensitivity .
they had dammed up the tennessee river .
so to me , it 's an experiment that 's waiting to happen , and if it confirms the prediction , then we should have a very powerful tool .
and that will just add to the effectiveness of our control efforts .
how the media covers africa in the west , and the consequences of that .
the challenge facing all those who are interested in africa is not the challenge of reducing poverty .
does any one of you know a country that developed because of the generosity and kindness of another ?
because all governments across the world need money to survive .
we have limited input , because he who pays the piper calls the tune .
hand-to-mouth is 2.6 trillion .
finally , i want to say that before i came to speak here , i was told that the principle of tedglobal is that the good speech should be like a miniskirt .
and from the ten commandments to growing my beard -- because leviticus says you cannot shave .
so i think half of my book advance went into sunscreen .
but i also learned that i was too healthy , and that was unhealthy .
and this , over the years , can cause real damage , cardiovascular damage .
the book about it comes out in april .
flavor is king . flavor rules .
and this is what every student has to begin with .
then we go into final shaping , " panning " -- which means putting the shaped loaf on a pan .
again , transformed in stage 10 in the oven because what went into the oven as dough comes out in stage 11 as bread .
we harvest the wheat , and in harvesting it , we kill it .
it 's like clay .
but dough is what we 're working with , and we take that dough to the oven , and it goes into the oven . as soon as the interior temperature of that dough crosses the threshold of 140 degrees , it passes what we call the " thermal death point . "
and the egyptian who was tending the beer fell asleep in the hot , egyptian sun , and it turned into bread .
one is total chaos . the other is absolute order .
but to us , we 're sort of trying to evoke a self-effacing gesture , as if there 's a little person with outstretched arms behind this enormous piece of paper .
it could be a few claps or a strong applause , and then nothing happens until the viewer leaves the stage , and again the audience will respond .
these figures are sort of entrapped within this very strong grid , which is like a prison , but also a fortress , because it allows them to be oblivious and naive and carefree and quite oblivious of the external world .
sylvia has said we must use every capacity we have in order to know the oceans .
it 's immensely complex .
we can 't solve all the problems by looking only at the oceans , but if we don 't understand the fundamental life support system of this planet much more thoroughly than we do now , then the stresses that we will face , and that cody will face , and even nancy , who 's going to live till she 's 98 , will have really problems coping .
and it wasn 't easy . it wasn 't easy in those days .
it was once called neptune .
so anyone coming along later simply accesses the database and can draw down the information they need about anything that has taken place .
very , very powerful .
and the next generation fiber will be simply magic .
and as i go here , i just want to show you what we can bring into classrooms , and indeed , what we can bring into your pocket .
and so he came up with this beautiful curve .
nature uses self-organizing systems .
so it 's just like georg cantor said , the recursion continues forever .
aren 't these scaling patterns just universal to all indigenous architecture ?
well , it 's true that some african fractals are , as far as i 'm concerned , just pure intuition .
so i tracked down one of the folks who makes these things , this guy in mali just outside of bamako , and i asked him , " how come you 're making fractal fences ? because nobody else is . "
and i started explaining why i was there in africa , and they got very excited when they saw the cantor set .
and he said , " well , instead of using one stroke and two strokes , let 's use a one and a zero , and we can count by powers of two . "
actually , the reason that google was such a success is because they were the first ones to take advantage of the self-organizing properties of the web .
but really the most significant thing , the most profound thing about this picture is that it was taken two days before i was completely paralyzed from the neck down .
so , i 'm just going to show you a basic idea .
it happens because there 's too much concentration of oxygen in your body .
but , the problem was that it didn 't allow us much time .
it 's just pure mechanics , allowing you to cycle air through this breathing loop .
now , normally you don 't have to do that because all of it 's done automatically for you with the electronics , the third system of a rebreather .
it 's extremely clear water , because there 's hardly any plankton .
and if you 're a biologist and you know about sharks , and you want to assess , you know , how much jeopardy am i really in here , there 's one question that sort of jumps to the forefront of your mind immediately which is -- diver 1 : what kind of sharks ?
as a fish nerd , i have to laugh , because you know they don 't call us fish nerds for nothing -- we actually do get excited about finding a new dorsal spine in a guppy .
now , this one 's pretty cool .
and the reason this photograph is extraordinary is because it captures a moment in the very last minute of a person 's life .
i was having lunch with him just a few minutes ago , and a nigerian journalist comes -- and this will only make sense if you 've ever watched a james bond movie -- and a nigerian journalist comes up to him and goes , " aha , we meet again , mr. bond ! "
and talking about war , my girlfriend has this great t-shirt that says , " bombing for peace is like fucking for virginity . "
and it 's important to know igbo is a tonal language , and so they 'll say the word " igwe " and " igwe " : same spelling , one means " sky " or " heaven , " and one means " bicycle " or " iron . "
well , it 's just a joke , anyway .
a pakistani muslim teaching jewish holocaust history to young igbo children .
we are squandering the most valuable resource we have on this continent : the valuable resource of the imagination .
i 'm more interested in the stories we tell about ourselves -- how as a writer , i find that african writers have always been the curators of our humanity on this continent .
so i went to google earth and learned about africa .
you 've been seasoned by wind , dusk and sunlight .
and after 70 hours of intensive singing lessons , he found that the music was able to literally rewire the brains of his patients and create a homologous speech center in their right hemisphere to compensate for the left hemisphere 's damage .
and at the very core of this crisis of mine , i felt somehow the life of music had chosen me , where somehow , perhaps possibly in a very naive sense , i felt what skid row really needed was somebody like paul farmer and not another classical musician playing on bunker hill .
i created it because a lot of people at school disliked justin bieber a little bit , so i decided to make the app .
there 's these programs called the ipad pilot program , and some districts have them .
but i also had noticed that it wasn 't working .
no one -- and i apologize to wheaties if there 's someone -- no one , no one will read this book .
and that 's what i 'm thinking about in terms of putting yourself in a -- you became a sort of expert in how you lean in .
one of the happiest moments i had in this whole journey is , after the book came out , i stood on a stage with john chambers , the ceo of cisco .
the foundation i started along with the book " lean in " helps women , or men , start circles -- small groups , it can be 10 , it can be however many you want , which meet once a month .
ss : the book is about self-confidence , and about equality .
since i gave my ted talk and published my book , another year of data came out from the u.s. census .
when you eat healthier , manage stress , exercise and love more , your brain actually gets more blood flow and more oxygen .
one of the most effective anti-smoking ads was done by the department of health services , showing that nicotine , which constricts your arteries , can cause a heart attack or a stroke , but it also causes impotence .
it turns out people think when they win the lottery their lives are going to be amazing .
so let 's have some people do what they usually do and spend money on themselves , and let 's make some people give money away , and measure their happiness and see if , in fact , they get happier .
so if you give undergraduates five dollars , it looks like coffee to them and they run over to starbucks and spend it as fast as they can .
and what we see is sort of amazing because there 's human universals on what you do with your money and then real cultural differences on what you do as well .
they had no money , they went to a clinic and i gave her this money . "
i know you 're all looking at that red country in the middle .
you actually lose money because it doesn 't motivate them to perform any better .
the teacher writes you a thank you note . the kids write you a thank you note .
well i was born in the most difficult time , when my country was at war .
i even had a movie out called " war child , " funded by muslim people .
never give up . never give in .
your empty bellies on the telly and now it 's you that i 'm fighting for .
and so the power music has i normally compare to the power love when love doesn 't see a color .
and so i made a commitment . i say , " i 'm gonna not eat my breakfast . "
it 's rain . africa is fertile . they can grow the crops .
and so at this moment i want to ask to celebrate emma with me .
in particular , one person had put it forward .
this is roughly between 100 and 150 million , today .
you know , that woman that goes around to foundations asking for money , thinking about the economics of terrorism .
but the great change came , of course , with globalization and deregulation .
now , until 9-11 , the bulk of all this money flew into the u.s. economy because the bulk of the money was denominated in u.s. dollars and the money laundering was taking place inside the united states .
now , many of you know that the patriot act is a legislation that greatly reduces the liberties of americans in order to protect them against terrorism .
i told you this story because you must understand that there is a world that goes well beyond the headlines of the newspapers , including the personal relationship that you have with friends and family .
and so we redefined this marginalized position as the place of architecture .
and both owner and architect alike are empowered to critique those manifestations based on the positions that you 've taken .
and this had to do with the ambitions of the leadership .
at first blush you think , " hey it 's crazy , what could you possibly gain ? "
well now there are potentials of this building to allow the artistic director to actually move into the building without using our architecture .
and there it is in the thrust configuration .
now , if i 'll take you through -- this is an early concept sketch -- take you through kind of a mixture of all these things together .
it was very unusual .
the year is 1800 .
two of my students , jim and james , traveled around india and thailand , starting to think about this problem a lot .
there is an xy stage , and then there is a focusing stage , which is a flexure mechanism that 's built in paper itself that allows us to move and focus the lenses by micron steps .
can we get the lights back on again ?
and i want to leave you with this picture .
i 'm not going to dive into them either , but photosynths are integrated into the map .
all right . i 'm hitting it . i 'm punching play .
when you use it on the spot , it means that you 're able to bring all of that metadata and information about the world to you .
i didn 't do it as well , but we managed to get youssou n 'dour , sting , tracy chapman , and bruce springsteen to go ' round the world for amnesty , and it was an amazing experience .
the other soldier also came .
anyway , witness has been trying to arm the brave people who often put their lives at risk around the world , with cameras , and i 'd like to show you just a little more of that . thank you .
and i knew someday that i was going to do something that had to do with trying to share news about it and protect it .
please enjoy .
and as he ate , he was so full -- he probably had about 200 lbs of meat in his belly -- and as he ate inside one side of his mouth , he was regurgitating out the other side of his mouth .
and here we are diving in the beaufort sea .
but it 's worth it .
they 've got that wryly smile on their mouth .
it just sees this big balloon in the ocean -- it doesn 't have hands -- it 's going to take a little bite , the boat pops , and off they go .
and you can 't publish excuses . "
this didn 't work .
and i thought , she 's about to bite .
but it 's a special kind of social norm , because it 's a social norm that wants to tell us who we can relate to and who we shouldn 't relate to .
our social lives in the future depend on that .
people are always a combination of the two , and that combination is constantly changing .
me was always trying to become something , somebody .
i would drive it and demand things from it .
in the middle of my traveling , i turned 40 and i began to hate my body , which was actually progress , because at least my body existed enough to hate it .
my body had not only become a driven machine , but it was responsible now for destroying other women 's bodies in its mad quest to make more machines to support the speed and efficiency of my machine .
and in the name of connectedness , the only thing she wanted before she died was to be brought home by her beloved gulf of mexico .
it was my head that was bald -- and comfortable now without a hat .
it was energy , love and joy .
i decide that i 'm going to get my very own piece of bazooka bubble gum .
this was his own assembly of heroes that kept him from drugs and gangs and from giving up on his dreams .
heard about it , at least ? you probably hear about genomes these days .
and with these four letters , you can create a language : a language that can describe anything , and very complicated things .
we are starting to understand that .
and what that means is , you are going to walk around with your own personal genome on a smart card . it will be here .
we can understand functionality . this is really important .
they have discovered pathways that create flavors , although it 's very important to understand that those compounds that it 's cranking out have to match a receptor in our genome , in our tongue , for us to understand and interpret those flavors .
we now understand that those microbes have more impact on our climate and regulating co2 and oxygen than plants do , which we always thought oxygenate the atmosphere .
... and they would say , " are , you know , are you playing god ? "
carbon dioxide , a little bit of sunlight , you end up with a lipid that is highly refined .
other animals are conscious .
these are big brains , highly social animals , and i thought , well , if we give them choice and control , if they can hit a symbol on this keyboard -- and by the way , it was interfaced by fiber optic cables from hewlett-packard with an apple ii computer .
so i started cold-calling , and eventually got through to sue savage-rumbaugh , and she invited me down .
and then i was struck in the history of the internet .
we 're really excited about the possibility of an interspecies internet , and k.j. has been enjoying the conference very much .
so at that point , if we can go back to the other computer , we were starting to think about how you integrate the rest of the biomass of the planet into the internet , and we went to the best possible person i can think of , which is vint cerf , who is one of the founders who gave us the internet . vint ?
that 's the internet of things that 's coming .
tell me a little bit about where you 're going to take the idea .
it 's such a delight to have you on the stage .
and it 's funny -- it feels a bit like this now for oil .
and our military get quite unhappy with having to stand guard on pipelines in far-off-istan when what they actually signed up for was to protect american citizens .
this muscle car from toyota : 408 horsepower in an ultra-light that does zero to 60 in well under four seconds , and still gets 32 miles a gallon . i 'll say more later about this .
and the reason this has not been very seriously examined before is there was a common assumption in the industry that -- well , then it might not be safe if you got whacked by a heavy car , and it would cost a lot more to make , because the only way we know how to make cars much lighter was to use expensive light metals like aluminum and magnesium .
each one is formed by one fairly cheap die set , instead of four expensive ones for stamping steel .
so we have lots of options .
we ought to take them out back and shoot them , and put bounty hunters after them .
we can use less oil faster than they can conveniently sell less oil .
but that little story is really about the fears and misconceptions that come along with the idea of moving through the city without sight , seemingly oblivious to the environment and the people around you .
from that came a lot of insights , or outsights , as i called them , things that i learned since losing my sight .
and i 'm not paranoid , but everywhere i go , i 'm getting all sorts of advice : go here , move there , watch out for this .
i didn 't get that sighted .
if you design a city with the blind in mind , you design a city with a robust , accessible , well-connected mass transit system that connects all parts of the city and the region all around .
like polls . you know , it 's always curious to me that in public opinion polls the percentage of americans who don 't know the answer to any given question is always two percent .
i don 't approve of them because arguments , of course , are all about contradiction , and they 're shaped by the values that i have questions with .
and i 'm not an expert on sadomasochism .
and this still goes on as i think i told you last year .
" for sale : white trash compactor . "
so the next time that one called i let him get halfway through his spiel and then i said , " you sound sexy . "
and i said , " well , that 's how you know only stupid people go into it . "
" oh no . thanks though , i 'll leave them here . thanks very much .
well yeah , i mean why we forced china to open her markets .
and that 's the shock of recognition at the shock of recognition .
and thank you for inviting me into it .
where you say , like , ' 87 was like a good year , right ?
now , one day , some crazy banker had an idea .
you know , i always wonder , who makes up those rules ?
we know that the problem begins immediately .
i used to make stuff up . right ?
you come back from vacation .
this year , somewhere between 44 and 52 percent of those kids will be on grade level .
you know , they convinced me . i 'm sure some of you were like me -- the latest and greatest thing , the palmpilot .
the real safety of our nation is preparing this next generation so that they can take our place and be the leaders of the world when it comes to thinking and technology and democracy and all that stuff we care about .
but i 'm not kidding about some of this , and it gets a little bit to the grit issue .
it 's really maneuverable . you have a hand-held remote , so you can pretty easily control acceleration , braking , go in reverse if you like , also have braking .
i cast my mind back when i was in second grade at a beautiful little government-run school called boronia park in the suburbs of sydney , and as we came up towards lunchtime , our teacher , ms. russell , said to the class , " hey , year two . what do you want to do after lunch ?
the universe " is written in the mathematical language . "
31 is a prime number , and that five in the power is also a prime number .
but one of the great things about the search for massive primes , it 's not just finding the primes .
this is the largest prime number we knew in 1996 , a very emotional year for me .
they found another megaprime . "
it 's got a remarkably clear yes / no answer , and just requires phenomenal grunt .
i was there . it was the most emotional , exciting day .
thank you .
three-fourths of our oil fuel is transportation .
so let 's start by making autos oil free .
seven years ago , an even faster and cheaper american manufacturing technology was used to make this little carbon fiber test part , which doubles as a carbon cap .
together , those things can give us the same or better access with 46 to 84 percent less driving , saving another 0.4 trillion dollars , plus 0.3 trillion dollars from using trucks more productively .
changing how we make electricity gets easier if we need less of it .
but a standard industrial pumping loop was redesigned to use at least 86 percent less energy , not by getting better pumps , but just by replacing long , thin , crooked pipes with fat , short , straight pipes .
in contrast , the net additions of nuclear capacity and coal capacity and the orders behind those keep fading because they cost too much and they have too much financial risk .
that is , they can disconnect fractally and then reconnect seamlessly .
so focusing on outcomes , not motives , can turn gridlock and conflict into a unifying solution to america 's energy challenge .
and so the victorians were trying to live through and simultaneously invent a whole new scale of living : this scale of living that we , you know , now call " metropolitan living . "
so this was the state of london in 1854 , and in the middle of all this carnage and offensive conditions , and in the midst of all this scientific confusion about what was actually killing people , it was a very talented classic 19th century multi-disciplinarian named john snow , who was a local doctor in soho in london , who had been arguing for about four or five years that cholera was , in fact , a waterborne disease , and had basically convinced nobody of this .
he found increasingly that people who drank from the pump were getting sick .
it 's a map of deaths that ended up creating a whole new way of life , the life that we 're enjoying here today . thank you very much .
" what do you want to do in a village ?
what the poor thought was important would be reflected in the college . "
there are no contracts , no written contracts .
i said , " yes , they made the blueprints , but the barefoot architects actually constructed the college . "
so long as the sun shines , we 'll have no problem with power .
and what do we teach in these schools ?
he is my psychoanalyst . he is my teacher .
telephone ? no .
those three women have trained 27 more women and solar-electrified 100 villages in afghanistan .
i knew which woman i would like to take .
and listen to people . they have the solutions in front of you .
we haven 't heard about why the buildings failed .
what was the difference between chile and haiti ?
the way at the top is a poorly constructed building that will fail .
so this dung pat was actually -- well , it was a dung pat 15 minutes before this photograph was taken , and we think it 's the intense competition that makes the beetles so well-adapted to rolling balls of dung .
what we 're going to do now is shade the sun with a board and then move the sun with a mirror to a completely different position .
how far can we push them before they will reorientate themselves ?
so the background here is around about 50 degrees centigrade .
this is a dung beetle . watch what he 's doing .
it knows the bearing home , and it knows it should be in that direction .
we know that the dance behavior is an orientation behavior and it 's also a thermoregulation behavior , and we also know that they use a path integration system for finding their way home .
smiling is one of the most basic , biologically-uniform expressions of all humans .
smiling stimulates our brain reward mechanism in a way that even chocolate -- a well-regarded pleasure inducer -- cannot match .
i wonder how many of you , looking at that , said to yourselves just now , " i would not have done that .
the heart , of course , you felt .
so toby founded an organization called giving what we can to spread this information , to unite people who want to share some of their income , and to ask people to pledge to give 10 percent of what they earn over their lifetime to fighting global poverty .
so let 's talk about effectiveness .
so some people think that would be a good thing to give to .
why was he recovering from surgery ?
i know bill joy was talking to you about the wonders of carbon nanotubes , so i 'm going to talk to you about the wonders of carbon macro-tubes , which is charcoal .
and one of the things that they found was they didn 't burn .
and you can make a very thick , sticky porridge out of it , which you can use to bind together the charcoal briquettes .
and after some time , we developed a low-cost press that allows you to produce charcoal , which actually now burns longer , cleaner than wood charcoal .
and this is about the most exciting thing in my life right now , which is perhaps a sad commentary on my life .
these are the issues that we need to be training our engineers , our designers , our business people , our entrepreneurs to be facing .
so you can 't use the same models that you use in the united states for making things move forward .
now many of you will recognize her symptoms .
and in many ways , the law has worked .
but we needed another test to make the diagnosis .
what a lost opportunity .
and what this has led to is a more personalized approach to the treatment of lung cancer that also includes sex .
and therefore we know that women are not getting the full benefit of modern science and medicine today .
it 's particularly a cultural crisis , a crisis of the institutions unable to reimagine the stupid ways which we have been growing , unable to challenge the oil-hungry , selfish urbanization that have perpetuated cities based on consumption , from southern california to new york to dubai .
so while , as an architect , this is a very compelling thing to witness , this creative intelligence , i also want to keep myself in check .
they were also lucky , they said , because they began to dig in a sort of bermuda triangle of jurisdiction , between port authority , airport authority , two city districts , and a review board .
and this is my world .
and then you notice that those seeds become farms across the bronx that look like this .
so i call this " from south bronx to southampton . "
but this , i show you , when kids from the poorest congressional district in america can build a 30-foot by 15-foot wall , design it , plant it and install it in the heart of new york city , that 's a true " sí se puede " moment .
a year ago today , i was invited to the new york academy of medicine .
when tenacious little ones learn how to garden like this , it 's no wonder we get fruit like that .
we 're also designing coin ponds for the rich and affluent .
they are now , my first cohort is all in college , earning a living wage .
keep kids out of stores that look like this .
we are growing our way into a new economy .
and i was paying for this myself , so i asked the translator if it would be ok if i stayed for the week .
this is the first morning i stayed with her .
and in the course of the grandmother talking to the translator , the grandmother started crying .
and i said , " i 'll pay for the ... " i mean , i had this whole sort of picture .
and this man came to the door and kind of barked something in korean .
and i said , " i 'm staying in a hotel downtown .
i said , " i 'm in love with your niece , i think she 's an incredibly special child . "
hyun-sook stayed at father keene 's , and her uncle agreed to let her stay there until the adoption went through .
gail couldn 't come .
and we fall asleep -- and i 've been in this room , you know , for a couple of months now .
we 're all choking , and there 's smoke pouring through the vents , under the doors . there 's people screaming .
and there , in the building were photographers waiting for people to jump .
this is the last picture before gene and tim headed back .
this is a deal i had with natasha , which is that when we got to atlanta she could take -- she could cut off my beard .
beauty pageant .
natasha : later , i 'll do that later .
and " sunfish " is one of the words for basking sharks .
and they killed about 12,000 sharks in this period , literally just by stringing a manila rope off the tip of keem bay at achill island .
there 's now a ban on catching them and even landing them and even landing ones that are caught accidentally .
we use a pole camera on the boat to actually film shark .
and his tags popped off in the caribbean and even in brazil .
so it does seem to be that basking sharks , for some reason , have incredibly low diversity .
so what it tells us actually is that there 's actually a risk of extinction of this species because its population is so small .
and that was fine . we got wet . no problem .
and he was amazed that they actually got dna from the slime .
and i was thinking of humpback whales breaching and dolphins .
and keep an eye out for sharks .
so it turns out there was a company across the river called google who had started a digitization project a few years back that might just enable this approach .
now we 're thinking , what data can we release ?
how to know ?
through the 30s and 40s , no one cared .
so here you will become famous by the end of your 50s , and become very , very famous afterward .
if it 's very large , maybe you 're benefiting from propaganda .
so in two weeks flat -- the two weeks before our paper came out -- they coded up a version of the ngram viewer for the general public .
google has started to digitize 15 million books .
and in these donor meetings , i noticed that many of the worst projects -- which were put forward by our clients , by the governments , by promoters , many of them representing suppliers from the north -- that the worst projects were realized first .
it was even tax-deductible .
this is what these other cultures demand .
why ? because it would make it necessary to criminalize the corruption of deputies .
i 'm a , or was , or kind of am a toy designer .
no , she 's not , she 's beautiful .
this is a clay maker .
so this is a -- i used to kind of be an actor .
and i tried to sum this up in some kind of symbol that means something , to me anyway .
there 's another one .
and then i had to figure out how i 'm going to use that one motor to make the eyes move , and the ears move , and the body to move , and the mouth to move .
this is my wife christi , who is just , you know , my muse and my partner for eternity here .
and hasbro actually said , i meant tiger electronics at the time , said , " yeah , we want to do this .
for a while , they were making two million furbys a month .
and you could actually find full fossil evidence of these .
and there 's kind of the first exploded view , or see-through view .
i 'd like to give john a hand . he never gets recognition . this is john sosoka .
there you go .
you -- so it 's -- yes , he likes that .
having more than all the orangutans in all the zoos in the world together , just now like victims for every baby , six have disappeared from the forest .
when i stood there in the grass , it 's hot -- not even the sound of insects -- just this waving grass .
what we did was we formulated recipes -- how to go from a starting situation where you have nothing to a target situation .
february .
in principle , you make those trees into biological photovoltaic cells .
this is what it looks like in reality ; you have this irregular ring around it , with strips of 100 meters wide , with sugar palms that can provide income for 648 families .
air humidity is up 10 percent .
and look , there 's now 11.2 percent more clouds -- already , after three years .
the people get that acacia timber which we have preserved with the bamboo peel , and they can build a house , they have some fuel wood to cook with .
i 've been blown away by the whole thing .
so i want to talk about education and i want to talk about creativity . my contention is that creativity now is as important in education as literacy , and we should treat it with the same status .
anyway , the three boys came in -- four-year-olds with tea towels on their heads -- and they put these boxes down , and the first boy said , " i bring you gold . "
shakespeare being seven ? i never thought of it . i mean , he was seven at some point . he was in somebody 's english class , wasn 't he ? how annoying would that be ?
children dance all the time if they 're allowed to , we all do .
they all came into being to meet the needs of industrialism .
we think in abstract terms , we think in movement .
it wasn 't an available condition .
what ted celebrates is the gift of the human imagination .
and the tapir has a prehensile penis .
now if you 've ever been out for a nice , peaceful walk by the lake and happened to see some ducks having sex , you 've undoubtedly been alarmed , because it looks like gang rape .
so we 've seen very different strategies that males are using when it comes to winning a female partner .
and i 'm happy most of the time , because i think this is the happiest species on the planet .
to our knowledge they had no music .
the wild bonobo lives in central africa , in the jungle encircled by the congo river .
that 's a wasps ' nest .
goodbye .
the rock that kanzi is using is extremely hard and ideal for stone tool making , but difficult to handle , requiring great skill .
" a frame " represents a hut in the woods .
this environment brings out unexpected potential in kanzi and panbanisha .
none of us , bonobo or human , can possibly even imagine ?
and you can see he looks always the same .
what we tried to do was teach a stick figure how to walk .
so , it was back to the drawing board for us .
what we really wanted was a full human body .
i 'm going to push it a bit harder now , harder than i just pushed chris .
now , just a fun thing : what happens if you put that character -- this is now a wooden version of it , but it 's got the same ai in it -- but if you put that character on a slippery surface , like ice .
so that you don 't have a character that looks limp , but actually a character that you can use in an action film straight away , that looks kind of alive in midair as well .
it 's even worse -- and that is another video i just got last night -- if you render that a bit more realistically .
with this technology , video games will look different and they will feel very different .
this was an ai contour that was produced and evolved -- half-evolved , i should say -- to produce balance , basically .
i vividly remember being woken up in the middle of the night and gathering the few belongings we could and walking for about two hours to a safe house .
now , all these experiences of living in different parts of africa growing up did two things to me .
the central bank governor will think you 're crazy .
these are people like the late nelson mandela and most of the leaders that we see in africa today , like paul kagame and so forth .
another example is erick rajaonary .
we would get about 4,000 applications a year for 100 young leaders that we could take into this academy , and so i saw the tremendous hunger that existed for this leadership training that we 're offering .
and you can 't tell the story about pollinators -- bees , bats , hummingbirds , butterflies -- without telling the story about the invention of flowers and how they co-evolved over 50 million years .
and i thought that they 'd probably say , " well , it 's all about sex . "
you can strike out , which means you don 't get to have any sexual activity .
so if it 's prom night or a wedding night or at a party or if our parents aren 't home , hey , it 's just batter up .
you talk about it .
there 's a million different ways to eat pizza .
but under the pizza model , they 're questions .
it 's forced child labor on an institutional scale .
you want to see the classic sweatshop , meet me at madison square garden , i 'll take you down the street , and i 'll show you a chinese sweatshop .
we don 't have a regulatory system able to ensure that that production is safe .
companies didn 't feel it was their responsibility .
they have resources , and if we can add the will , the commitment , they know how to deliver that product .
you don 't need to believe me . you shouldn 't believe me .
i know as well that this often seems like an overwhelming level of responsibility for people to assume .
that 's my simple understanding of human rights .
" ben , i 've read somewhere that at minus 40 , exposed skin becomes frostbitten in less than a minute , so how do you answer the call of nature ? "
there 's a wire dangling down either side .
my brother sent me a text message , an sms -- it was a quote from the " simpsons . " it said , " you tried your hardest and failed miserably .
we had a frantic sort of 45 minutes of filming , photography ; while the helicopter was still there , i did an interview on the satellite phone ; and then everyone else climbed back into the helicopter , wham , the door closed , and i was alone .
later in the expedition , the problem was no longer the ice .
when you get lots of mist , low cloud , the wind starts blowing the snow up .
: ninety .
the pilot , i knew , was called troy . i was expecting someone called troy that did this for a living to be a pretty tough kind of guy .
of course , when you 're on the ice , you only ever see one obstacle at a time , whether it 's a pressure ridge or there 's a bit of water .
scott had sort of ponies and some tractors and a few dogs , all of which went wrong , and scott and his team of four people ended up on foot .
on the stage that day , i was so nervous .
i looked at my father and looked at those dry fields .
and the reporters came too , which lead to bloggers and which lead to a call from something called ted .
this device , the ade 651 , was sold to the iraqi government for 40,000 dollars apiece .
and that 's called superstition , and that , i 'm afraid , we will always have with us .
we have a pattern detection problem that is assessing the difference between a type i and a type ii error is highly problematic , especially in split-second , life-and-death situations .
how about here ?
so if you present subjects the images such that it 's going to end up on the right hemisphere instead of the left , then they 're more likely to see patterns than if you put it on the left hemisphere .
you miss the real patterns . you don 't want to be too skeptical .
it turns out what you 're thinking about a lot influences what you tend to see .
and so your brain is fooled .
what 's the difference between those ?
because , let 's face it , some patterns are real .
so i 'm going to end here with a short video clip that sort of brings all this together .
girl : okay .
ice is the canary in the global coal mine .
and that led me to this project .
we 've got 33 cameras out this moment .
goes up to 280 and then drops for various reasons that aren 't important to discuss right here .
so there 's a wall of ice a couple thousand feet deep going down to bedrock if the glacier 's grounded on bedrock , and floating if it isn 't .
now we turn on our time lapse .
you can see this river being formed .
the interior of greenland is to the right .
we have a problem of perception .
in fact , this is not unique to hiv . the vast majority of viruses come from animals .
when they sample from animals , they collect the blood on the filter paper and this allows us to identify yet-unknown viruses from exactly the right animals -- the ones that are actually being hunted .
ok ? and you can consider all sorts of different bush meat .
needless to say , i was drastically wrong .
this is what it looks like now .
it 's also working in live animal markets -- these wet markets -- which is exactly the place where sars emerged in asia .
it was never popular with many political leaders , especially those in the united states who somehow thought that new media would be able to do what missiles couldn 't .
well my theory is that it 's happening because censorship actually is less effective than you think it is in many of those places .
we tend to think that somehow this is going to harm these dictatorships , but in many cases it only strengthens them .
they may have become slower , but the activists could still access it and actually argue that having access to them is actually great for many authoritarian states .
well i say we have to stop thinking about the number of ipods per capita and start thinking about ways in which we can empower intellectuals , dissidents , ngos and then the members of civil society .
so you 'd just see her feet .
well it looked like a little shanty shed when i 'd finished .
the gentleman who commissioned me to do this was a gentleman called peter huf .
i found these little bits of glass .
then i used fibers out of my jumper , which i held and stretched .
audience : no .
even though they get on our nerves , i would never kill an insect because , " all creatures great and small " -- there is a hymn that says that .
so say if you cut a period stop in half , a full stop , that 's about the size of the whole thing .
it must be a machine . "
so most of my work , i don 't use glue .
it 's very painstaking work , but the best things come in small packages .
these fossils were deposited in a river system .
it 's a dinosaur like no other .
but we could keep that idea around the trees .
and also there is no boundary between classrooms .
in summer you go swimming .
and of course , the ceiling height is very low .
the principal says , " i don 't train them . we leave them on top of the roof .
and , voila ! i got in .
but if i work harder than ever , i can bring this number up to millions .
and they were going up , and they finally made it to the peak .
that 's why we had a barrel like this down in our basement , filled with cans of food and water .
but even so , we were far slower than we should have been getting the thousands of workers into these countries .
third , it didn 't get into many urban areas .
for soldiers , we have full-time , waiting to go .
the world bank estimates that if we have a worldwide flu epidemic , global wealth will go down by over three trillion dollars and we 'd have millions and millions of deaths .
this was reinforced by the political climate of the day .
my friends did not show up .
i am no longer alone when i stand up to speak about these things .
there 's nothing as powerful as that , knowing that i 'm meant to do this , because you don 't get scared , you just continue living your life .
it will go to the absolute core .
i rarely did , but what my mom said to me was , one day , she handed me a newspaper , a headline which said , here we have a huge change .
and i thought to myself , " that sounds clumsy . that sounds odd .
this guy is an american . his name 's graham allison .
china also believes that it is being contained by u.s. allies and by those with strategic partnerships with the u.s.
be constructive in areas of the bilateral , regional and global engagement between the two , which will make a difference for all of humankind .
everyone in that cafe , every one of the white folks , stood up and applauded .
you can make a practical contribution , and for all you good folks here , next time you meet someone from china , sit down and have a conversation .
i decided to make mine a life that was worth saving .
so i had to compromise with operational research work , which had the intellectual challenge that interested me and the commercial value that was valued by the clients : things like scheduling freight trains , time-tabling buses , stock control , lots and lots of stock control .
because the other day when i said , " my husband 's an angel , " a woman complained -- " you 're lucky , " she said , " mine 's still alive . "
so what has all that taught me ?
i could literally see people 's back straighten as they started to speak into the microphone .
josh has asperger 's syndrome .
the important thing for you is that you have a few very good friends , and really that 's what you need in life .
today , more than 100,000 people in all 50 states in thousands of cities and towns across america have recorded storycorps interviews .
you never want to go back to black and white .
oi : i love you , lady . mj : i love you too , son .
he wrote a book called " the four things that matter most " about the four things you want to say to the most important people in your life before they or you die : thank you , i love you , forgive me , i forgive you .
or imagine mothers on opposite sides of a conflict somewhere in the world sitting down not to talk about that conflict but to find out who they are as people , and in doing so , begin to build bonds of trust ; or that someday it becomes a tradition all over the world that people are honored with a storycorps interview on their 75th birthday ; or that people in your community go into retirement homes or hospitals or homeless shelters or even prisons armed with this app to honor the people least heard in our society and ask them who they are , what they 've learned in life , and how they want to be remembered .
thank you .
" why is this so hard ? " you may ask .
even something as simple as a household pet can present an infinite number of variations to the object model , and that 's just one object .
we were thrilled to have put together imagenet , and we wanted the whole research world to benefit from it , so in the ted fashion , we opened up the entire data set to the worldwide research community for free .
now , i 'm ready to show you what the computer says that the little girl saw at the beginning of this talk .
the boy is wearing his favorite t-shirt given to him as a gift by his father after a trip to sydney , and you and i can all tell how happy he is and what 's exactly on his mind at that moment .
wish us luck .
oxygen inhibits that process .
you don 't see the surface structure .
and look at the structures that my students are making at the university of north carolina .
from all these articles , you would think there must be a mountain of research verifying the widespread nature of pms .
however , in 1994 , the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders , known as the dsm , thankfully -- it 's also the manual for mental health professionals -- premenstrual dysphoric disorder .
another reason for the persistence of the pms myth has to do with the narrow boundaries of the feminine role .
however , the financial gain of perpetuating the myth that pms is a common mental disorder and is treatable is quite substantial .
so the good news about pms is that while some women get some symptoms because of the menstrual cycle , the great majority don 't get a mental disorder .
we need to find better ways to remember them .
i was chained by a metal cable to my bed .
once a guard came to me , very aggressively , and he told me , " today you 're going to kneel and beg for your food . "
on one day , one night in that cellar , i don 't know what it was , i heard a child crying above my head , a boy , maybe two or three years old .
he was young , he was shy .
it 's what makes us feel , i don 't know , simply human .
you can see the difference you make every day .
attacks on humanitarian aid workers are war crimes in international law .
i 've lost that count .
we studied 16 men and women , located in seven countries across the globe , working in 12 different industries .
i was recently at pixar , and i 'm here to tell you that number 15 is sure to be a winner .
because that animator was allowed to share what we referred to as his slice of genius , he was able to help that director reconceive the character in a subtle but important way that really improved the story .
they understand that innovation rarely happens unless you have both diversity and conflict .
bill and his leadership team , who he referred to as his brain trust , had to figure out what to do about this situation .
some of you may be sitting there and saying to yourselves right now , " we don 't know how to do those things in my organization .
not on creating a vision .
i 'm creating the space where people are willing and able to share and combine their talents and passions . "
if we want to invent a better future , and i suspect that 's why many of us are here , then we need to reimagine our task .
they 're not robots , and there 's nothing special about them .
i just punched him right in his face , and we began fighting right then and there .
the u.s. attorney general recently released a report stating that they 're going to ban solitary confinement in new york state for teens .
you get health insurance ? dental ?
that plane with those people is going somewhere , while we 're here stuck .
the newly prescribed silver bullet is microcredit .
thank you .
latin america is ground zero for both of them .
the commission is a high-level group of global leaders brought together to identify more humane and effective approaches to the issue of drugs .
after a very successful gun-collection program , we were elated .
but today , the international drug control regime is starting to crumble .
and in the case of drugs , in order to undermine this fear and prejudice that surrounds the issue , we managed to gather and present data that shows that today 's drug policies cause much more harm than drug use per se , and people are starting to get it .
since then , the internet has transformed the way we communicate , the way we do business , and even the way we live .
what you are sending , in many ways , is actually a postcard , and it 's a postcard in the sense that everybody that sees it from the time it leaves your computer to when it gets to the recipient can actually read the entire contents .
so while pgp does a great job of what it 's designed to do , for the people out there who can 't understand how to use it , the option to communicate privately simply does not exist .
so what we have to do is we have to encrypt it before it even leaves bob 's computer , and one of the tricks is , we encrypt it using the public key from alice .
it 's something that we really have to pay attention to going forward .
this buzzing is a cicada .
we 're talking hundreds of kilometers from the nearest road , there 's certainly no electricity , but they had very good cell phone service , these people in the towns were on facebook all the time , they 're surfing the web on their phones , and this sort of got me thinking that in fact it would be possible to use the sounds of the forest , pick up the sounds of chainsaws programmatically , because people can 't hear them , and send an alert .
they can listen to the sounds of the forest .
this is the moment where you can see where i 'm actually regretting perhaps the entire endeavor .
that same technology was deployed later in north africa for similar purposes to help activists stay connected when governments were deliberately shutting off connectivity as a means of population control .
this is great for most kids . right ?
i 'm going to throw the giraffe behind my back and whoever catches it is going to help me on this next thing .
but if we give it a little bit more thought , like a paper clip .
perfect . sir , you 're going to play my role in this story .
did you feel i influenced you in any decision ?
i never saw him again .
now , i want you to take the bill and fold it like this , lengthwise , so it becomes like a rectangle , and then again -- really fold it , really crease it -- and when you have it , please fold the bill again into a little square like this and let me know when you have it .
you can shuffle cards in a variety of ways .
is that your signature ?
audience member 4 : two . hg : two , and ?
then , one night about two years ago , i was looking after my grandfather and i saw him stepping out of the bed .
once pressure is applied , the connectivity between the particles increases .
and i kept thinking , one day i could be sitting in front of a doctor who looks at my exams and says , " ricardo , things don 't look very good .
so we started thinking about that as a company for the last 30 years .
that 's not how we do the rest of our lives .
don 't tell us where you are .
and we looked at that and we said , we have to start much earlier .
we have all kinds of things where we say , don 't worry about the course material anymore .
and follow this all the time and we know how they 're doing and we say , you 're not interested in this now , let 's wait a year .
it is a beautiful cemetery in cambridge .
it 's what i 'd like to call my empty bucket list .
so ricardo , you 're kind of crazy .
so you 've got actual evidence now that the kids so far going through your system , there 's a dramatic increase in performance .
we have variations of this one question , from three onwards .
not so much different from us , they can use plants to treat their intestinal parasites .
they 're toxic to most animals , but not to monarchs .
and what we find when we do that is always the same .
the toast is then deposited for some time .
so for example , americans make toast with a toaster .
and this brings us to our third part of the exercise , which is to draw how to make toast , but this time in a group .
you start with a question , you collect the nodes , you refine the nodes , you do it over again , you refine and refine and refine , and the patterns emerge , and the group gets clarity and you answer the question .
at that time , msf and the treatment center there , they were seeing dozens of patients every single day , and these patients , these communities were becoming more and more terrified as time went by , with this disease and what it was doing to their families , to their communities , to their children , to their relatives .
and the reason that this is such an important story , ladies and gentlemen , is because today , this county , which is right at the center of this epidemic you 've been watching , you 've been seeing in the newspapers , you 've been seeing on the television screens , today lofa county is nearly eight weeks without seeing a single case of ebola .
as the virus was spreading geographically , the numbers were increasing and at this time , not only were hundreds of people infected and dying of the disease , but as importantly , the front line responders , the people who had gone to try and help , the health care workers , the other responders were also sick and dying by the dozens .
ladies and gentleman , this was one of the most concerning international emergencies in public health we 've ever seen .
first and foremost , the communities have got to understand this disease , they 've got to understand how it spreads and how to stop it .
we saw the red cross movement working with its partner agencies on the ground there to help train the communities so that they could actually safely bury their dead in a dignified manner themselves .
and these people , yes , they 're tired , but they are not fatigued .
he purchased his own plane ticket , and went to the village where this had occurred .
a facebook page can become the hub of a massive mobilization .
now , compare that to what the civil rights movement had to do in 1955 alabama to protest the racially segregated bus system , which they wanted to boycott .
and i 've come to realize that part of the problem is that today 's protests have become a bit like climbing mt . everest with the help of 60 sherpas , and the internet is our sherpa .
but his party won two major elections within a year of the gezi protests with comfortable margins .
i still see the friends that i made in those zapatista-convened global protests more than a decade ago , and the bonds between strangers are not worthless .
don 't rush to the door .
in this bush , we found two huts .
we went to senegal , then france , and then singapore .
no , i was the only person with a bit of a color on me .
my mother had said it was called circumcision , but here it was mutilation .
do you get itchy down there ? "
didn 't happen .
so once i went through this strange phase of anger and pain and confusion , i remember booking an appointment with my therapist .
i went home and i said to my mom , " your act , your action , no matter what your may defense may be " -- because she thought she did it out love -- " what you did out of love is harming me , and it 's hurting me .
you heard me right .
it 's saying that women don 't have a right to sexual pleasure .
my favorite quote is , " all it takes for evil to prevail is for a few good men and women to do nothing . "
what you 're listening to is the sound of the brain of this monkey as it explores three different visually identical spheres in virtual space .
but that 's a different talk , and a different neuroscientist needs to talk about that .
and this is what we wanted to show during the world cup , and couldn 't , because for some mysterious reason , fifa cut its broadcast in half .
but it gets a little more interesting when you get three monkeys in there and you ask one monkey to control x and y , the other monkey to control y and z , and the third one to control x and z , and you make them all play the game together , moving the arm in 3d into a target to get the famous brazilian orange juice .
and to get that thing done , you need at least two monkeys to synchronize their brains , but the ideal is three .
moderator : wow . okay , that 's where we are going .
the hard material here is silicon , and the soft material is silicone rubber .
we want sensing , power , control , actuation all together , and not everything needs to be bio-inspired .
we can cut violent deaths around the world by 50 percent in the next three decades .
that 's because warfare and humanitarian action are going to be concentrated in our cities , and the fight for development , whether you define that as eradicating poverty , universal healthcare , beating back climate change , will be won or lost in the shantytowns , slums and favelas of our cities .
it 's spiky .
well , for one thing , they 're young .
right here in brazil , the life expectancy is 73.6 years .
violence is going virtual .
mobility matters in our cities .
they are the ice melt of the south and north poles .
on this journey , we faced the danger of crevasses , intense cold , so cold that sweat turns to ice inside your clothing , your teeth can crack , water can freeze in your eyes .
when things go wrong for us , it 's life or death , and our brave african-american daryl , who would become the first american to walk to the north pole , his heel dropped off from frostbite 200 klicks out .
to look after antarctica , you 've got to first engage people with this extraordinary place , form a relationship , form a bond , form some love .
ladies and gentlemen , a survivor -- and i 'm good -- a survivor sees a problem and doesn 't go , " whatever . "
you will find some resourceful entrepreneurs who can recharge your cell phone using bicycles .
this solution is based on simple-to-use medical devices that less qualified health workers like nurses can use in rural clinics .
and third , most importantly , because of the growing income disparity between the rich and the middle class in the west , there is a big disconnect between existing products and services and basic needs of customers .
but the frugal innovation revolution in the west is actually led by creative entrepreneurs who are coming up with amazing solutions to address basic needs in the u.s. and europe .
the exciting news is that 's starting to happen .
the south pioneered frugal innovation out of sheer necessity .
now , we used to have six billion hectares of forest -- 50 percent more than what we have -- 2,000 years ago .
now i will go through all of them one by one -- no , just giving some examples of what we had done in the next few years .
but it 's interesting to know that it 's quite the opposite .
for many years now , they don 't have the sufficient cold weather to actually control the population of this beetle .
so the question is , can we make it ?
i think we are doing this with deforestation in brazil , and i hope we can do it also with climate change in the world .
so i just took a short clip from " batman begins " here and you know , presumably he 's wearing makeup , the lighting here is kind of challenging , but still , just from the video , we 're able to extract his pulse and show it quite well .
we can see how our veins and arteries are pulsing in our bodies .
it 's like seeing still pictures come to life .
but this made us think . it gave us this crazy idea .
it was one of the first sound recording devices in history .
every language is just a group of people who agree to understand each other .
when you leave the house in the morning , your mom doesn 't say , " hey , honey , i think it 's going to be cold , take a hoodie , don 't forget to obey the law of gravity . "
we usually take words for things that we like , like delicious food .
almost any word in english can be verbed .
a lot of people on this stage today have said , " in the future , you can do this , you can help with this , you can help us explore , you can help us invent . "
i 'll tell you what they do next .
and are they carrying this need for constant validation with them into their future lives ?
in our country , there are groups of students who chronically underperform , for example , children in inner cities , or children on native american reservations .
then this is going to be a great challenge .
they used an extraordinary algorithm called deep learning .
humans don 't learn by being told what they see , but by learning for themselves what these things are .
as i say , using deep learning is about the best system in the world for this , even compared to native human understanding .
in the radiology case , they were new clinical indicators that humans can understand .
so as we go through this process , we 're gradually telling the computer more and more about the kinds of structures we 're looking for .
and using that approach , by 15 minutes we get to 97 percent classification rates .
but in five years ' time , computers will be off this chart .
i turned it on , and there it was : ferguson , missouri , michael brown , 18-year-old black man , unarmed , shot by a white police officer , laid on the ground dead , blood running for four hours while his grandmother and little children and his neighbors watched in horror , and i thought , here it is again .
let me just start with number one .
men are my default .
we 've gone about as far as we can go trying to make a difference trying to not see color .
and we were outside , it was late at night , and we were sort of wondering where we were going , we were lost .
and i 'm not asking you to take any crazy risks .
something really powerful and beautiful happens : you start to realize that they are you , that they are part of you , that they are you in your family , and then we cease to be bystanders and we become actors , we become advocates , and we become allies .
we still have in us this old stuff about superiority and it is causing us to embed those further into our institutions and our society and generations , and it is making for despair and disparities and a devastating devaluing of young black men .
mounted on roads or on police cars , automatic license plate readers capture images of every passing car and convert the license plate into machine-readable text so that they can be checked against hot lists of cars potentially wanted for wrongdoing .
just as the police in ferguson possess high-tech military weapons and equipment , so too do police departments across the united states possess high-tech surveillance gear .
on the surface , it sounds boring , because it is , but something about this tv experiment has gripped norwegians .
i 'm talking to the guests , some information .
it has 120-year-old , very interesting history , and literally takes part in life and death along the coast .
this guy , for instance , he 's head of research at the university in tromsø and i will show you a piece of cloth , this one .
cameraman : i work on different camera solutions .
even the passengers on board the hurtigruten coastal ship -- -- they chose to watched the telly instead of turning 90 degrees so we were allowed to be part of people 's living room with this strange tv program , with music , nature , people .
it 's important that we don 't edit the timeline , and it 's also important that what we make slow tv about is something that we all can relate to , that the viewer can relate to , and that somehow has a root in our culture .
when people smile , it might be a very good slow idea , so after all , life is best when it 's a bit strange .
snipers , loyal to the government , started firing on the civilians and protesters on institutskaya street .
they speak about different gender roles in conflict , not only in maidan , and not only in ukraine .
this guerrilla -- and the main group is the farc guerrillas , revolutionary armed forces of colombia -- they have financed their war by kidnapping , by extortion , by getting into the drug trade , by illegal mining .
we didn 't understand in colombia , if you live in the cities , you 're very far away from where the war is actually happening , so you don 't really understand it , and we asked the government to give us access to as many demobilized guerrillas as possible .
she had been recruited when she was 15 , and she left when she was 17 , so there were a lot of other complications , but they did eventually meet .
what happened later is that the guerrillas who came out during the christmas tree operation and all of that said , " that 's really good , christmas trees are really cool , but you know what ? we really don 't walk anymore .
thank you .
the hospital 's maternity ward was really stressed out because a lot of babies were born on this gray november day .
and this is the green line : labor demand .
will technology change this picture and boost productivity ?
as a matter of fact , the overall number of people involved in the production of a car has only changed slightly in the last decades , in spite of robots and automation .
out of a list of 26 topics , salary is only number eight .
however , one crucial underlying factor is to change our attitudes .
[ " disruption of political meeting " ] for those who lie , saying they are back with [ the party ] , your time is running out .
i need them to hear what i heard , i need them to see what i saw , but i also understood , we need the palestinians themselves , the people that are suffering , to be able to tell their own stories , not journalists or filmmakers that are coming outside of the situation .
not all the settlers and the soldiers are acting this way .
unfortunately , i can 't show you the hidden cameras we 're using today — for obvious reasons — but these are cameras we used before .
sometimes , it 's about putting it in the media , mostly local ones , to create awareness .
now , i am carrying this .
it 's an old idea .
and one of my biggest surprises as a traveler has been to find that often it 's exactly the people who have most enabled us to get anywhere who are intent on going nowhere .
and so when i was 29 , i decided to remake my entire life in the light of going nowhere .
and i wasn 't entirely surprised when the record that he released at the age of 77 , to which he gave the deliberately unsexy title of " old ideas , " went to number one in the charts in 17 nations in the world , hit the top five in nine others .
maybe you saw discomfort .
well , the reasons are many , but one reason requires that we understand a little bit more about how our eyes work .
a higher waist-to-hip ratio is an indicator of being less physically fit than a lower waist-to-hip ratio .
and again , like the previous study , we found that waist-to-hip ratio predicted perceptions of distance .
we thought this was great .
however , in reality , these cars are the same size , but that 's not how we see it .
people often associate autism with liking maths and science and nothing else , but i know so many autistic people who love being creative .
if i was trying to fit myself into a box , i wouldn 't be here , i wouldn 't have achieved half the things that i have now .
so if people want to be these things , why are so many people striving to be normal ?
but it actually turns out that your cells sit in this mesh of complicated fibers , proteins and sugars known as the extracellular matrix .
now , in the time that it takes me to introduce the bleed itself , our material is able to stop that bleed , and it 's because it actually goes on and works with the body to heal , so it reassembles into this piece of meat , and then the blood actually recognizes that that 's happening , and produces fibrin , producing a very fast clot in less than 10 seconds .
i 'm just not as passionate about my job as i am about baseball . "
we didn 't even understand that it had been 75 years since lou gehrig and nothing had been done in the progress against als .
i said , " but i do have to tell you that i 'm watching your body language and i 'm listening to what you 're saying .
he can 't speak .
it was during week two that our neighbor next door opened up our door and threw a pizza across the kitchen floor , saying , " i think you people might need food in there . "
okay , so the als association , they think by year end , it 'll be 160 million dollars .
i actually had to ditch support groups because everybody was in there saying that spraying their lawns with chemicals , that 's why they got als , and i was like , " i don 't think so , " but i had to get away from the negativity .
and so — — and so let me leave you with pete 's words of inspiration that he would use to classmates , coworkers and teammates .
after a while , i got a bit — i wanted to go somewhere else .
well , when i arrived in peru , actually , i had no idea about what i would do there .
i was researching . i was still keeping this idea in mind : what 's the point ?
to reinvent life today , and it 's very simple .
and it 's a big project i 'm doing over this year , which is researching in very different regions of brazil , in very different forms of cults , and trying to understand how people live together with spirituality nowadays .
i had this one doctor , dr. sam , who always took care of me .
it made her scared and it made her doubt .
we 're scared of patients finding out who we are and what medicine is all about .
some want to be sure that their doctor is unbiased and is making decisions based on evidence and science , not on who pays them .
medscape 's public forum and several online doctors ' communities had thousands of posts about this topic .
over social media , a tweetchat , which i 'd learned what that was by then , generated 4.3 million impressions , and thousands of people wrote to encourage me to continue .
not only did she sign advance directives , she wrote a 12-page document about how she had suffered enough , how it was time for her to go .
i don 't hide anything from them .
but by and large , that 's not it .
the answer lies over there , in cutting off supply and demand . "
so is legalization the answer ?
i mean , don 't forget , coca-cola had cocaine in it until 1900 , and so far as we know was no more addictive than coca-cola is today .
thank you . thank you .
that young man wasn 't a politician , he wasn 't a businessman , a civil rights activist or a faith leader .
on page seven he says , " the welfare of a nation can , therefore , scarcely be inferred from a measurement of national income as defined above . "
do i have rights ?
we don 't measure how much a country spends on healthcare , we measure the length and quality of people 's lives .
so what 's going on ? well , look .
and that 's good news , and that 's what we 've seen over the last 20 , 30 years , with a lot of people lifted out of poverty by economic growth and good policies in poorer countries .
it 's an area the size of europe , 24 million people , one of the most deprived parts of the country .
his fever went down , his appetite came back .
if we taught doctors how not to use antibiotics as much , if we taught patients how not to demand antibiotics , perhaps this really wouldn 't be an issue , and maybe the pharmaceutical companies should be working harder to develop more antibiotics .
we might consider doing that for antibiotics as well , and perhaps that would make sure that antibiotics actually get used appropriately .
now , there are backstop options , which is other alternative technologies that people are working on .
now , what 's common to all of these things is the idea that we 've had these technologies to control nature only for the last 70 , 80 or 100 years and essentially in a blink , we have squandered our ability to control , because we have not recognized that natural selection and evolution was going to find a way to get back , and we need to completely rethink how we 're going to use measures to control biological organisms , and rethink how we incentivize the development , introduction , in the case of antibiotics prescription , and use of these valuable resources .
his name was nanko , and he also liked the idea .
we learned that during those times , people in communities really stick together during these times of hardship , but we also learned a very important element , the importance of barbecues . because , when you throw a barbecue , so we decided to throw one almost every other week , and we got to know everybody in the neighborhood .
about that if you go somewhere and you spend time there , you can let the project grow organically and have a life of its own .
and even if counterintuitive , it 's good news .
what if , instead of thinking of 40 square meters as a small house , why don 't we consider it half of a good one ?
in addition to that , let 's say a guy goes every single day through the third floor , but has no idea what the guy on that floor is working on .
so this alternative was irresponsible .
what is the right question .
thank you so much .
this is leblon .
the idea of voting as our only exercise in citizenship does not make sense anymore .
there 's also jovita .
we have already started doing it in são paulo with incredible results , and want to take it to cities around the world through a network of citizen-centric , citizen-led organizations that can inspire us , challenge us , and remind us to demand real participation in our city lives .
well , the reason of course is that they 're trying to avoid charges associated with making calls and sending texts .
i cofounded avaaz , which uses the internet to mobilize people and now has almost 40 million members , and i now run purpose , which is a home for these kinds of technology-powered movements .
let 's look a little bit at this .
that said , keep one thing in mind : we 're at the beginning of a very steep curve .
so we 've spent a bit of time thinking , how can we plot organizations on a two-by-two where , essentially , we look at new power values and new power models and see where different people sit ?
well , if you 're there thinking , in old power , this won 't happen to us .
now , new power models live and die by the strength of their networks .
humanity takes center stage at ted , but i would like to add a voice for the animals , whose bodies and minds and spirits shaped us .

two weeks ago , afghanistan had its first democratic transfer of power and elected president ashraf ghani , which is huge , and i 'm very optimistic about him , and i 'm hopeful that he 'll give afghanistan the changes that it needs , especially within the legal sector .
and so we decided to take this case to the supreme court .
this device consists of a large , round table and some machinery .
there are lots of injuries .

the pulse amplitude modulated fluorometer , or pam , gauges the fluorescence of corals as it pertains to pollutants in the water as well as climate change-related issues .
quite literally right there i am skyping in the classroom with one of the six continents and some of the 70,000 students that we connected every single day to some of these experiences .
we shape the role it plays in our lives and the way we make meaning from it , but to do that , we have to pay as much attention to how we think as how we code .
and the diagnosis was factually correct , but it didn 't tell the whole story .
many times over , we can process exabytes of data at lightning speed , and we have the potential to make bad decisions far more quickly , efficiently , and with far greater impact than we did in the past .

the following week , he began ever so slightly to show muscle resistance .
kitra cahana : for most of us , our muscles begin to twitch and move long before we are conscious , but my father tells me his privilege is living on the far periphery of the human experience .
but there 's one question that always seems to me to be most revealing , and that is : what did you take ?

we do it by detecting a set of very small molecules that circulate freely in our blood called micrornas .
this chart is showing the specific micrornas present in this sample and how they reacted over time .
today , my aunt , she 's fighting bravely and going through this process with a very positive attitude .
now , just as every cell requires nutrients to fuel it , every cell also produces waste as a byproduct , and the clearance of that waste is the second basic problem that each organ has to solve .
here , we 're again imaging into the brain of living mice .
so if sleep , then , is part of the brain 's solution to the problem of waste clearance , then this may dramatically change how we think about the relationship between sleep , amyloid-beta , and alzheimer 's disease .
i always say the same thing to them .
in fact , whenever you bring it up in a debate about surveillance , people instantaneously dismiss it as inapplicable , and what they say is , " oh , well in ' 1984 , ' there were monitors in people 's homes , they were being watched at every given moment , and that has nothing to do with the surveillance state that we face . "
thank you .
glenn , thank you very much . gg : thank you very much .
those sums of money are called remittances .
in mexico and sri lanka , the birth weight of children is higher among families that receive remittances .
so , is it that there are no options , no better options , cheaper options , to send money ?
for that matter , between the post office and any national banking system that has a large network that serves the poor .
it is not only construction workers from bangladesh , it is all the workers . there are millions of migrant workers who suffer from this problem .

in the second place , the costs of participating in this system are incredibly high .
and we should be immensely proud of this .
it 's about reaching a consensus as much as finding a proper way of channeling our disagreement .
but we were hacking it in the sense that we were radically changing the way a political party makes its decisions .

wealth concentration is always a lot higher than income concentration .
some families make huge capital gains .
and then , in the postwar period , you had unusually high growth rate , partly due to the reconstruction .
now , there are other ways to redistribute wealth , which it can be tempting to use .
one of the arguments against your point of view is that economic inequality is not only a feature of capitalism but is actually one of its engines .
so i have responded point by point to every concern .
i was sitting at home on the couch with the flu and browsing the internet a little , when i found out that handel had written works for the keyboard .
to give you a feel for this idea , imagine the following scenario : you walk into your child 's day care center .
we 're going through slices through my head like that .
but still , maybe this is something weird about my brain and no one else has one of these things in there , so to find out , we scanned a bunch of other people and found that pretty much everyone has that little face-processing region in a similar neighborhood of the brain .
all right ?
we want to see the whole thing , so let 's inflate it so we can see the whole thing .
this region responds when you think about what another person is thinking .
the brain could have been a single , general-purpose processor , more like a kitchen knife than a swiss army knife .
its mission , to train physicians for the people who need them the most : the over one billion who have never seen a doctor , the people who live and die under every poverty line ever invented .
there 's no running water , no electricity there , and to reach the village , you have to walk for hours or take your chances in a pickup truck like i did skirting the waves of the atlantic .
here in the united states , where we have healthcare reform , we don 't have the professionals we need .
take the garífuna grads .
so in the best case scenarios , these graduates are staffing and thus strengthening public health systems , where often they 're the only doctors around .
thank you .
five years ago , i was asked to moderate a panel of executives , and the topic for the evening was " what do you look for in high-potential employees ? "
this doesn 't mean that this advice is unimportant .
so we don 't want to put 100 percent of the responsibility on women 's shoulders , nor would it be wise to do so , and here 's why : in order for companies to achieve their strategic financial goals , executives understand that they have to have everyone pulling in the same direction .

now , society hasn 't advanced all that much .
researchers in tokyo are using it as a potential anti-theft device in cars .
arthur samuel knew strategy .
the problem : the medical literature only knew nine of them .
now , we like to think that technology creates jobs over a period of time after a short , temporary period of dislocation , and that is true for the frame of reference with which we all live , the industrial revolution , because that 's precisely what happened .
is a completely different prospect .
now , the first of these transformations through the description of beijing .
or it 's an opportunity which we can lose .
again , breathing was a hazardous activity .
we 'll see , but what you 're seeing now four hundred million , more than the population of the united states .
i don 't have to list all those things to an audience like this , but you can see the electric cars , you can see the batteries using new materials .
surely not . let 's make the next 100 years the best of centuries .
the indians say , " the forest has more eyes than leaves . "
a geyser is underground water heated by magma , exploding into the atmosphere and transferring this water into the atmosphere .
and brazil is very proud of it because it provides more than 30 percent of the power that is consumed in brazil .
we are floating here on this floating hotel , on one of the largest rivers on earth , the negro river .
this relation between a living thing , which is the forest , and a nonliving thing , which is the atmosphere , is ingenious in the amazon , because the forest provides water and seeds , and the atmosphere forms the rain and gives water back , guaranteeing the forest 's survival .
if you have the opposite situation , a forest , the evaporation , as we showed , is much greater , because of the trees , and this relation is reversed .
she does a wonderful job rebuilding ecosystems .
if we don 't see , we don 't register the information .
even when this happens , we also see something that we don 't know .
what you see is that the architecture of the invisible humiliates the best architects in the world .
you see , while the industrial revolution did a great deal to improve humanity , it eradicated the very skill that my grandfather loved , and it atrophied craftsmanship as we know it .
it doesn 't stop there .
with 3d printing , complexity is free .
just last month , nasa announced the discovery in orbit around nearby stars , almost doubling overnight the number of planets we know about within our galaxy .
if we could hear it , it would be popping like a bag of popcorn .
so now , if we look back at the sky , at our asteroids that were streaming across the sky , these asteroids are like the debris of our solar system .
and these observations were more complex .
it took three years to find just 42 supernovae because the telescopes that we built could only survey a small part of the sky .
and we go to the next question .
that 's you .
now , we miss the majority .
we still have this group , almost a billion , over there , but that can be ended now .
fortunately , i will be able to comfort you by showing why it was not your fault , actually .
a shark attack on a swedish person will get headlines for weeks in sweden .
okay , this little shortlist , what are we going to do with it ?
so you 're sitting with a question in front of you and you 're unsure . you should guess " improve . "
of course there are dangerous things that are also great .
today it 's 50 / 50 .
this photo was taken just before they left from italy to immigrate to the united states , just about a century ago .
it 's really pretty remarkable .
here 's our rendering of how we would actually invite people into the space itself .
we replaced these cars with trees , using which now we can make multi-layered forests .

first of all , i never like to presume to speak for the ted community , but i would like to tell you that i have a feeling we can all agree that you are still charming , seductive and sexy . yes ?
so throughout my life , i 've seen women — family , friends , colleagues — live through these experiences , and they seldom talk about it .
and no one wanted to be responsible for it .
while supportive comments poured in from across the world , as did vicious ones .
you see , as a writer , i approached this issue as an observer , as an indian , i felt embarrassment and disbelief , and as an activist , i looked at it as a defender of rights , but as a citizen journalist , i suddenly felt very vulnerable .
in a recent survey in india , 95 percent of the women who work in i.t. , aviation , hospitality and call centers , said they didn 't feel safe returning home alone after work in the late hours or in the evening .
in 2008 , i was working for the ministry of agriculture of rwanda , and my boss had just been promoted to become the minister .
we devise agronomic algorithms which tell us how much rainfall a crop needs and when .
they were all providing loans to farmers , and often , just before they 'd finalize the loan , the farmer would say , " but what if it doesn 't rain ?
one of the first beneficiaries of this replanting guarantee was bosco mwinyi .
well , this may be on the science fiction fringe , but were even part of his scenario to come about , our ecology and even our species would surely not survive long unscathed .
some would say 10 percent worse .
usually , they were told that they were going to be exchanged for prisoners of war .
i decided a few years ago to photograph every single exhumed item in order to create a visual archive that survivors could easily browse .
and i was a — i 'd studied biology .
you will be shocked by what you see .
canine veterans of conflicts of iraq and afghanistan are coming back with what 's considered canine ptsd , and they 're having a hard time reentering civilian life when they come back from deployments .
they called in a veterinarian , who treated his wounds .
it turns out that we owe this entire psychopharmaceutical arsenal to other animals .
this is legit . in fact , some interesting studies have pointed to oxytocin levels , which are a kind of bonding hormone that we release when we 're having sex or nursing or around someone that we care for extremely , oxytocin levels raising in both humans and dogs or who enjoy each other 's company , and beyond that , other studies show that oxytocin raised even in other pairs of animals , so , say , in goats and dogs who were friends and played with each other , their levels spiked afterwards .
my lunch lady had grandkids , and therefore kids , and therefore left school at the end of the day ?
they took photos of their lunch lady 's head and plastered it onto my cartoon lunch lady and fixed that to a milk carton and presented them with flowers .
actually , the state of the river before entering the medina is pretty healthy .
so i 've got a question for you .

what sort of web do you want ?
every day , all around us , we see the consequences of silence manifest themselves in the form of discrimination , violence , genocide and war .
it is what you hear when there aren 't enough body bags left .
civics is the art of citizenship , what bill gates sr. calls simply showing up for life , and it encompasses three things : a foundation of values , and a set of skills that allow you to pursue goals and to have others join in that pursuit .
seamlessly , when a senior government official decides to leave government and become a lobbyist for a private interest for their new masters .
if people don 't learn power , if people don 't wake up , and if they don 't wake up , they get left out .
and you may like or dislike the efforts i 'm describing here in boulder or in tuscaloosa , but you cannot help but admire their skill .
and what i 'd like to do is to invite all of you to help create this curriculum with the stories and the experiences and the challenges that each of you lives and faces , to create something powerfully collective .
over the years , as a prison system , as a nation , and as a society , we 've become very good at that , but that shouldn 't make you happy .
an officer put a key in a lockbox , and hundreds of men streamed out of their cells .
we had beanbag guns and pepper spray and plexiglass shields , flash bangs , emergency response teams .
there were no toilets .
so next , i got reassigned as superintendent of a small prison .
i don 't see my job as to punish them or forgive them , but i do think they can have decent and meaningful lives even in prison .
prisons can be the source of innovation and sustainability , repopulating endangered species and environmental restoration .
you probably don 't know me , but i am one of those .01 percenters that you hear about and read about , and i am by any reasonable definition a plutocrat .
in 1980 , the top one percent of americans shared about eight percent of national [ income ] , while the bottom 50 percent of americans shared 18 percent .
so the model for us rich guys should be henry ford .
i actually bought two pairs of these pants , what my partner mike calls my manager pants .
because there 's some contravening evidence .

it 's essential to it .
and at this point in the process we had to come in every couple of days to do a stress test on the baby , and this is just routine , it tests whether or not the baby is feeling any type of undue stress .
let 's talk chances . let 's talk chances .
at your kid 's wedding reception . i remember like it was yesterday .
because their temperatures are high .
fine . but the problem with that test is so you might have a lot of hormone present , but it might not be actively working to regulate your body temperature .
we ride our bikes , we go to the gym occasionally .
by taking ownership of your data just like we 've done , just by taking this daily measurements about yourself , you become the expert on your body .
it 's not the worst thing in the world .
people think i 'm drunk all the time .
it 's not about mythology , or mythologizing myself to you .
that 's almost half of the internet population , and a sixth of humanity .
now , the next thing that you need to understand is how to design with data .
they had to go beyond just helping people ask their friend to take the photo down .
now i often have joked that i spend almost as much time designing the introduction of change as i do the change itself , and i 'm sure that we can all relate to that when something that we use a lot changes and then we have to adjust .
what if your country had no free press ?
have you ever made a small , weird sound when you remembered something embarrassing ?
have you ever subsequently texted that person the phrase " i 'm staring at the phone smiling like an idiot " ?
the only instructions i was given , that it likes it dark and damp and its favorite food is porridge oats .
there are four possible routes through this maze , yet time and time again , the slime mold established the shortest and the most efficient route .
it 's been sonified , replicated , simulated .
so people are invited to come and learn about what amazing things it can do , and they design their own petri dish experiment , an environment for the slime mold to navigate so they can test its properties .
each person brought in their own individual interpretation , and our conclusion from this experiment was that the people of rotterdam were highly cooperative , especially when given beer .
in these early installations , i would take plastic sheets , plastic bags , and things i would find in the hardware store or around the house .
i love science and biology .
and that 's when you know that something absolutely critical and dangerous is happening .
a lot of neurosurgical procedures actually start with a drill incision through the skull .
so you 're applying a force on a drill towards the wall .
and you 'll see that right at the moment of puncture , right there , the mechanism unlocks and retracts that tip back .
what kind of trocar do you use ? "
and today , as a cruciverbalist — 23 points — and an illusion designer , i create that chaos .
is this not making order out of chaos ?
did you know that your name is worth eight points in scrabble ?
and pick up another marker for me and take off the cap . isn 't this fun ?
we have a cobalt horse , we have a red donkey , we have an amber owl , we have an emerald rooster , a silver ox , i forgot my purple marker so we have a blank sheep , but that 's a pretty amazing coincidence , don 't you think ?
gwen , i was so confident that you were going to make these choices that i made another prediction , and i put it in an even more indelible place , and it 's right here .
thank you .
people actually tried to predict the future , even the economists .
what was happening there was you would have these manufacturing devices , and they weren 't making prototypes or powerpoints .
it 's 30 percent more efficient than the fossil fuel method , and it 's much better for the environment .
i 'm a three-time college dropout , so learning over education is very near and dear to my heart , but to me , education is what people do to you and learning is what you do to yourself .
i want to try to convince you that prejudice and bias are natural , they 're often rational , and they 're often even moral , and i think that once we understand this , we 're in a better position to make sense of them when they go wrong , when they have horrible consequences , and we 're in a better position to know what to do when this happens .
ac : governor perry , what about that ?
and to explore this , he did a series of classic studies with british adolescents .
and the case that 's been most studied is the case of race .
psychologists have explored this .
if you were to open up the new york times online or something , and discover this , and in fact this happens to us all the time , we go about our lives .
but other times we say , " this is wrong . "
and get someone on the other line .
it all comes back to those ones and zeros .
so that 's what i did . i came in on a saturday morning , and about 10 hours in , i sort of had all the pieces to the puzzle .
it 's not how people think , to think more like computers so that we can understand this information .
it takes minutes for anybody to learn what these patterns represent here , but years of experience in cyber in ones and zeros .
in seconds , we can pick out every pattern here .
so i was playing around with these same concepts and yet again , i was trying to find a very detailed , specific piece of code thinking i was looking at the right thing , only to see this doesn 't have the connectivity i would have expected for the code i was looking for .
i 'm not pretending this is an exhaustive list , but these seven , i think , are pretty large habits that we can all fall into .
for example , if i see something that really is awesome , what do i call it ?
actually doing what you say , and being somebody people can trust .
but if you want weight , you need to go down here to the chest .
of course , pitch often goes along with pace to indicate arousal , but you can do it just with pitch .
first , arms up , deep breath in , and sigh out , ahhhhh , like that .
that would be a world that does sound beautiful , and one where understanding would be the norm , and that is an idea worth spreading .
nist would like to obtain more data on the passwords users actually choose , but system administrators are understandably reluctant to reveal password data to others . "
so we wanted to find some better source of data .
however , when we looked at the survey data , we saw that people were really frustrated by the very complex passwords , and the long passwords were a lot more usable , and in some cases , they were actually even stronger than the complex passwords .
and so we decided to do a research study to find out whether this was true or not .
so what we found in this study was that , surprisingly , pass phrases were not actually all that good .
it 's called " security blanket . "
and that guy is really cute .
fourteen months later , at 2 a.m. , i fired the shots that caused a man 's death .
it was the first time in my life that i had actually thought about the fact that my son would see me as a murderer .
in 2010 , i walked out of prison for the first time after two decades .
and one of the things that we talked about is the three things that i found important in my personal transformation , the first being acknowledgment .
" as young as i look , i am growing older faster than he .
it might be between two careers -- artist and accountant -- or places to live -- the city or the country -- or even between two people to marry -- you could marry betty or you could marry lolita .
i really loved philosophy .
there are a variety of things that matter in such a choice , like the excitement of the work , achieving financial security , having time to raise a family , and so on .
we 're weighing the merits of two jobs , after all , not the merits of the number nine and a plate of fried eggs .
understanding hard choices in this way uncovers something about ourselves we didn 't know .
there is no best alternative .
the other set of people , their eyes light up , and they say , " you are just the person i want to talk to . "
okay , many fewer .
you can put your belt back on , put your computer back in your bag .
now , it 's not that dictionary editors ignore these kinds of attitudes about language .
if you look in the front matter of american heritage dictionaries , you can actually find the names of the people on the usage panel .
does the language have to change that way ? "
it seemed like my basic assumptions just stopped working .
for example , we had an exercise where we all stood in a circle , and each person had to do the world 's worst tap dance , and everybody else applauded and cheered you on , supporting you onstage .
so b is essential in order to get going , but c is much more profound , and that 's the amazing thing about resesarch .
students started playing off of each others ' ideas , and we made surprising discoveries in the interface between physics and biology .
and i tried again and again , conference after conference , but i wasn 't getting through .
my charges were dismissed , but a few weeks later , two fbi agents knocked on my door , and they told me that unless i helped them by spying on protest groups , they would put me on a domestic terrorist list .
through the freedom of information act , i learned that the counter-terrorism unit has been monitoring my articles and speeches like this one .
so i am here today because i think we need hackers , and in fact , they just might be the immune system for the information age .
but there are other hackers , hackers who just like to break things , and it is precisely those hackers that can find the weaker elements in our world and make us fix it .
even companies founded by hackers , like facebook was , still have a complicated relationship when it comes to hackers .
and if the internet doesn 't like it when you try to remove things from it , just watch what happens when you try to shut the internet down .
and so the establishment has long had a love-hate relationship when it comes to hackers , because the same people who demonize hacking also utilize it at large .
[ one hundred and forty-three ] years after the end of slavery , and [ 43 ] years after the passage of the voting rights act , an african-american was elected president .
the march towards gay equality accelerated at a pace and is still reshaping our laws and our policies , our institutions and our entire country .
gay pioneer jack nichols said , " we marched with martin luther king , seven of us from the mattachine society " -- which was an early gay rights organization — " and from that moment on , we had our own dream about a gay rights march of similar proportions . "
it 's a documentary film , and it 's called " the new black , " and it looks at how the african-american community is grappling with the gay rights issue in light of the gay marriage movement and this fight over the meaning of civil rights .
who has that power ? nobody .
it is the star that guides us still , just as it guided our forebears through seneca falls and selma and stonewall . "
when we put a jet pack on them , or give them a perturbation like an earthquake , we discovered that their wonderfully tuned legs allow them to self-stabilize without using any of their brainpower .
it looks like a rapid , smooth , vertical climb , but when you slow it down , you see something very different .
let me tell you a story .
and mammals got bigger , their brains got bigger at an even faster pace , and the neocortex got bigger even faster than that and developed these distinctive ridges and folds basically to increase its surface area .
we have about 300 million of them , and we create them in these hierarchies .
" you guys are so funny just standing around , " was the typical comment , and they weren 't funny , not while doing surgery .
my 300 million modules in my neocortex isn 't going to cut it .
i 'd watch those same men walking back home every night .
if you can 't write about yourself anymore , then who do you write about ?
inside the rolls-royce is the queen mother .
sending out an s.o.s. come on now .
a vast majority of those people are not necessarily carrying a particular genetic load or risk factor .
second example , more recent , is elegant work done by helen hobbs , who said , " i 'm going to look at individuals who have very high lipid levels , and i 'm going to try to find those people with high lipid levels who don 't go on to get heart disease . "
they basically said , " let 's work on this in an open , crowd-sourced , team way to do this decoding . "
and looking within ourselves for information we used to say we should go to the outside , to experts , and to be willing to share that with others .
no one loses their inner demons by taking to the road .
because think about the teddy bear .
women are more likely than men to get a " magical feeling " when they see dolphins in the surf .
if you can see , it 's a polar bear that 's drowning and then it 's also being eaten simultaneously by a lobster and a shark .
they were calling it the " billy possum . "
we 're out there feeding plague vaccine to ferrets .
how does that work ? what does it mean ?
there was no running water .
to understand that , you have to , for a moment , think about combat not morally -- that 's an important job to do — but for a moment , don 't think about it morally , think about it neurologically .
you can imagine how that plays out in combat .
i 'm still very good friends with him .
it 's a mutual agreement in a group that you will put the welfare of the group , you will put the safety of everyone in the group above your own .
that is terrifying .
i had to disagree with her wholeheartedly when i first showed up there , because literally in the first four days , i had already run away five times from this school .
i remember when we first , right after 9 / 11 , three weeks after 9 / 11 , i was on a plane heading overseas , but i wasn 't heading overseas with the military , i was heading overseas because i got a scholarship to go overseas .
this is even before i deployed .
and the only questions i got from people was , " did you shoot anybody ? "
and now she uses her voice as a congresswoman from illinois to fight and advocate for a collection of issues to include veterans issues .
what i didn 't know then , and do know now , is that avoidance and endurance can be the entryway to forging meaning .
forging meaning and building identity does not make what was wrong right .
but the radicalism in their work actually lay in reinserting humanity into a society that was annihilating humanity itself , as , in some senses , russian society is now doing again .
people narrow the world and function in discrete groups without empathy for one another .
meeting john had been the discovery of great happiness and also the elimination of great unhappiness , and sometimes , i was so occupied with the disappearance of all that pain that i forgot about the joy , which was at first the less remarkable part of it to me .
and daddy , if you were little , i 'd be your friend . "
and it goes on , but as soon as i read this poem , i fell for it hard , so hard , i suspected we must have met somewhere before .
that 's how we did it in the pre-ted.com days .
rives : so that 's " close encounters , " and the main character is all worked up because aliens , momentously , have chosen to show themselves to earthlings at four in the morning , which does make that a very solid example .
take a look .
in " measure for measure , " it 's the call time for the executioner .
i got my curator on . i started fact checking , downloading , illegally screen-grabbing .
i received a poignant tweet .
" 7000 " series polish literature .
at the same time , though , we spend about as much money taking the smells off us as putting them back on in perfumes , and perfumes are a multi-billion-dollar business .
what about humans ?
you 're part of the in-group .
they simply don 't secrete those odorless precursors that the bacteria love to use to produce the smells that in an ethnocentric way we always thought of as characteristic of armpits .
so this is a sleeping baby , and under its nose , we 've put a clean glass rod .
there 's lots to find .
in other words , a coroner could find these things because this is a fatal recipe that will destroy the banks as well as the economy .
this is insane , it has to lead to massive losses , and it only makes sense for entities engaged in these accounting control frauds .
well , the government , as i told you , when we were the savings and loan regulators , we could only deal with our industry , and if people gave up their federal deposit insurance , we couldn 't do anything to them .
the same agency , office of thrift supervision , which was supposed to regulate many of the largest makers of liar 's loans has made , even today -- it no longer exists , but as of a year ago , it had made zero criminal referrals .
we need to shrink them to the point , within the next five years , that they no longer pose a systemic risk .
tod machover : something nobody 's ever heard before .
mtt : what happens when the music stops ?
all of a sudden , artists could sample from anything and everything that came before them , from a snare drum from the funky meters , to a ron carter bassline , albums like de la soul 's " 3 feet high and rising " and the beastie boys ' " paul 's boutique " looted from decades of recorded music to create these sonic , layered masterpieces that were basically the sgt. peppers of their day .
and the simplest way that i knew how to co-opt myself into that experience of wanting to be in that song somehow was to just get a band together of fellow nine-year-olds and play " wild boys " at the school talent show .
imagine any other singer from that era over it singing the same old lyrics .
so , i have a feature on my website where every week people submit hypothetical questions for me to answer , and i try to answer them using math , science and comics .
i started with money .
you could always look at the google recruitment messages that they post .
and i love calculating these kinds of things , and it 's not that i love doing the math .
they were not intelligent .
mt : robots cannot anticipate human actions .
edi : a robot may not harm humanity , or by inaction allow humanity to come to harm .
we are in our best suits .
there is shock , followed by a long silence .
and i think it also threatens to hold back businesses .
he 's a north carolina native , quintessential southern gentleman , white .
invite people into your life who don 't look like you , don 't think like you , don 't come from where you come from , and you might find that they will challenge your assumptions and make you grow as a person .
i 'm asking you to be bold .
well first of all , i 'll just say that i hope you can hear me okay .
now i can use allende , allende , allende , and , you know , i just need to say it , like , it 's so incredible to be here , and i knew that we were going to have these questions .
i know some of y 'all may be not really as much into the music , but the first way y 'all can always know , you know what i 'm saying , that i 'm in hip hop , is ' cos i hold the microphone in an official emcee posture .
you know , that kind of thing .
as long as the woman , in my case -- because it 's a modern world , do whatever you want to do , i don 't have any problem with anybody , enjoy yourself , lgbtqlmnop . all right ?
next . next . " will there ever be a post-racial world ? "
no , i am teasing about that .
thank y 'all for thinking about that right now in the present moment to influence the future .
that is a huge challenge .
what happens when you have clouds ?
changes in biomass burning , in smoke , in aerosol particles , all of those things change the climate .
the models are skillful in response to the ice sheets when it comes to the 20th-century trends over the decades .
we know where it 's gotten warmer .
the challenges were great .
and it costs just 500 dollars .
okay , and what we 're looking at here , this is sam 's optic nerve , which is a direct extension of her brain , so i 'm actually looking at her brain as we look there .
an american sprinter jumps out to the front .
as of the end of last year , 1,314 men had run under four minutes in the mile , but like jesse owens , sir roger bannister ran on soft cinders that stole far more energy from his legs than the synthetic tracks of today .
where does the record stand today ?
in 1983 , the national basketball association signed a groundbreaking agreement making players partners in the league , entitled to shares of ticket revenues and television contracts .
it 's like the long hull of a canoe for speed over the water .
there 's no explosion there .
this is a vertical ascent of more than 8,000 feet , and kílian went up and down in under three hours .
has that number been increasing dramatically over time ?
during that period , while the fetal brain is developing , we know that exposure to certain agents can actually increase the risk of autism .
that is , that it is one single , powerful , deterministic gene that causes the autism .
it 's not simply random 200 , 400 different genes , but in fact they fit together .
they absorb their surroundings in a different way , and we need to be able to educate them in a way that serves them best .
and she found that the physical objects that people were using were helping people understand how to use the exhibit , and were helping people learn in a social way .
with this interface , we open up a huge array of possibilities in between traditional board games and arcade games , where the physical possibilities of interaction make so many different styles of play possible .
when we began this process , we were looking , it was about three years ago , and we 'd just had the first two fatal shark attacks in western australia , and by chance , in a previous role , i happened to be having dinner with harry butler .
so i called up nathan , a little bit sheepishly , actually , about this idea that maybe we could use these patterns and shapes to produce a wetsuit to try and mitigate the risk of shark attack , and fortunately , he thought that was a good idea .
so we have to bait the rig , because we need to get the statistical number of samples through to get the scientific evidence , and by baiting the rig , we 're obviously changing shark behavior .
and eduardo .
i 've had to survive those changes and try to understand their implications for what i do for design .
i think of myself as an industrial designer .
it does hide its methods .
this is not the recipe for legibility at small size .
you can have as many fonts on your system as you like . "
up to that point , all the fonts on screen had been adapted from previously existing printing fonts , of course .
i would sometimes make , i don 't know , three or four different versions of a difficult letter like a lowercase a , and then stand back to choose which was the best .
will they outlive the now-obsolete screens and the flood of new web fonts coming on to the market ?
we can still see the little moon , but let 's go ten times further away again .
well , what 's going on ?
the petals unfurl , they open up , the telescope turns around .
we 're hoping it 'll be someone else 's solar system as seen through an occulter , through a starshade like that .
that sometimes shows up but it can be very confusing for parents because it is quite normative for children to act in a cross-gender play and way , and that in fact there are studies that show that even 80 percent of children who act in that fashion will not persist in wanting to be the opposite gender at the time when puberty begins .
sometimes their parents would reject them , siblings , their own children , and then their divorcing spouse would forbid them from seeing their children .
they look normal . they had normal heights .
well , i did something a little bit innovative , because i do know hormones , and that estrogen is much more potent in closing epiphyses , the growth plates , and stopping growth , than testosterone is .
he 's got a prominent adam 's apple .
i have always wanted to do that .
there have been a number of studies looking at how parents feel when they are spending time with their kids , and the answer often is , not so great .
the old arrangement might not have been particularly ethical , but it was reciprocal .
we teach our kids chess , thinking maybe they will need analytical skills .
guess what it was ?
happiness and self-confidence , teaching children that is not like teaching them how to plow a field .
i had had an unexpected c-section .
so i 've been thinking about that problem , and a thinker who has helped me think about it is a guy named joseph soloveitchik , who was a rabbi who wrote a book called " the lonely man of faith " in 1965 .
you have to surrender to something outside yourself to gain strength within yourself .
no virtuous act is quite as virtuous from the standpoint of our friend or foe as from our own standpoint .
pm : gabby , has your recovery been an effort to create a new gabby giffords or reclaim the old gabby giffords ?
it might be some of the most dangerous things i 've ever done .
she was a state senator at the time , and we met here , at the airport , before a trip to china .
pm : after you got married , however , you continued very independent lives .
months later , maybe about two months later , i started about getting my job back , which is something , when you become this primary caregiver person , which some people in the audience here have certainly been in that position , it 's a challenging role but at some point you 've got to figure out when you 're going to get your life back , and at the time , i couldn 't ask gabby if she wanted me to go fly in the space shuttle again .
pm : so gabby , what have you learned from your experiences the past few years ?
we 're trying to change that .
gg : yes .
they would , in fact , be part of a sierra leone where war and amputation were no longer a strategy for gaining power .
what is the intersection between technology , art and science ?
nobody knew the secret , can move all four wings in different directions at the same time .
some could one day patrol our body for all kinds of diseases and clean out clogged arteries along the way .
the folks who know the skills about how to teach and engage an audience don 't even know what teacher certification means .
now people oftentimes say , " well , magic is just magic . "
cities are fundamentally about people , and where people go and where people meet are at the core of what makes a city work .
so here you see a familiar sight .
so we came up with a radical , almost insane idea .
so that meant using one of our greatest assets : our transit system .
here you see what was two miles of abandoned , degraded waterfront in the neighborhoods of greenpoint and williamsburg in brooklyn , impossible to get to and impossible to use .
and i love when people come there and look up and they say , " wow , there 's brooklyn , and it 's so close . "
and when i saw it the first time , honestly , when i went up on that old viaduct , i fell in love the way you fall in love with a person , honestly .
if there is any one lesson that i have learned in my life as a city planner , it is that public spaces have power .
you 're familiar with his poetry .
it was just before i was going to give my first ted talk .
it was about six weeks before i gave my ted talk , and i was so grateful to chris that he asked me to give this ted talk , not because i had the chance to talk to you , although that was great , but because it pulled me out of an extraordinary depression .
now politicians and pundits tell you , there 's nothing we can do about this issue , americans don 't care about it , but the reason for that is that 91 percent of americans think there 's nothing that can be done about this issue .
and then finally number three , the hardest .
so facebook is not the only place you can do this , but it 's the biggest , and it serves to illustrate the numbers .
and again , it doesn 't come from what you might think of as obvious information .
how do you know that you 've liked something that indicates a trait for you that 's totally irrelevant to the content of what you 've liked ?
so i think the other path that we can go down that 's going to be more effective is one of more science .
we married a few months later , and this was the trip where we really went to see the animals and to see the savanna .
and so we picked those two things , and everything the foundation does is focused there .
this is the number of children who die before the age of five every year .
i mean , you 've used it in your letter this year , contrary to the current meme that aid is kind of worthless and broken , that actually it has been effective .
six years ago , i guess , bill came on full time , so moved from microsoft and became full time .
i can 't think of anything where one of us had a super strong opinion about one thing or another ? how about you , melinda , though ? can you ? mg : well , here 's the thing .
is anything , the story of what 's gone right there are there any failures that you can talk about ?
so she kept wanting to talk to me and jenn .
they need to have a sense that their own work is meaningful and important .
we need more experimentation .
well , i really think that most people here your lives have taken you have shaped the future .
say 99.999 percent of tweets pose no risk to anyone .
while this is a mockup i put together using my account , we see accounts doing this all the time .
i pause and i think , how could all of this go horribly wrong ?
in fact , this image also contains the equivalent of this , more specifically , this .
the tapeworm drains nutrients from artemia 's body , but it also does other things .
few topics in biology enthrall me more .
especially common were trematodes , tiny worms that specialize in castrating their hosts like this unfortunate snail .
they have as much control over their own fates as my car .
we don 't really know .
at the end of " on the origin of species , " charles darwin writes about the grandeur of life , and of endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful , and i like to think he could easily have been talking about a tapeworm that makes shrimp sociable or a wasp that takes cockroaches for walks .
my grandpa owned and operated a sheet metal kitchen cabinet factory in brooklyn .
i looked down and saw floor drains had been cut into the stone floor .
by miracles , i mean things that are technically barely possible , very high-risk , and might not be actually accomplishable at this moment in time , certainly not by you .
the problem is , no matter how talented , rich or smart you are , you only get one to one and a half miracles .
however , just as the technology of concrete was critical in realization of the pantheon , new designers will use the technologies of the internet to create novel concepts that will endure .
they will enable compelling new concepts in how we design cities , work , and the way we live .
five miracles , mostly delivered , and now you just need a clear vision of a better world filled with autonomous vehicles with seductively beautiful and new functional designs plus a lot of money and hard work to bring it home .
thank you , rick .
i mean , in that circumstance , couldn 't you argue that what he did was reasonable ?
they 're trying to hide from the government 's ability to isolate and interdict their actions , and so we have to swim in that same space .
i think it really is transparency and secrecy .
and we devote an inordinate amount of time and pressure , inordinate and appropriate , actually i should say , amount of time and effort in order to ensure that we protect that privacy .
with metadata , who knows what the conclusions are that are drawn ?
i think number two is cyber threat .
rl : well , i 'd say two things .
snowden said two days ago that terrorism has always been what is called in the intelligence world " a cover for action , " that it 's something that , because it invokes such a powerful emotional response in people , it allows the initiation of these programs to achieve powers that an organization like yours couldn 't otherwise have .
edward snowden , when , after his talk , was wandering the halls here in the bot , and i heard him say to a couple of people , they asked him about what he thought of the nsa overall , and he was very complimentary about the people who work with you , said that it 's a really impassioned group of employees who are seeking to do the right thing , and that the problems have come from just some badly conceived policies .
that 's not an nsa thing .
rl : thanks , chris .
but then suddenly we stopped and looked at each other and said , but why don 't we try and change this ?
now anonymous companies are great for sanctions busting too .
but don 't worry , it doesn 't have to be your name .
well , an example that really haunts me is one i came across recently .
my wish is for us to know who owns and controls companies so that they can no longer be used anonymously against the public good .
but it 's early days .
the crew is sitting in the astro van sort of hushed , almost holding hands , looking at that as it gets bigger and bigger .
but why would we take that risk ?
i thought , well maybe that 's why we have two eyes , so i kept working .
how do you change your behavior ?
and actually , if you keep on crying for a while , whatever that gunk was that 's in your eye starts to dilute and you can start to see again , and houston , if you negotiate with them , they will let you then keep working .
touchdown -- 3 : 14 and 48 seconds , a.m. central time .
that meant they were the most callous and the most aggressive of the entire prison population .
so , for example , when most of us look at a picture like this of somebody looking sad , we instantly have a slight , measurable physical response : increased heart rate , sweating of the skin .
at first , this isn 't perfect .
this naturally sociable animal will lose its ability to bond with other mice , even becoming aggressive when introduced to them .
such programs won 't work for everyone , but for many , it could be a way to break the frozen sea within .
i 'm going to talk about hackers .
so it 's no wonder that the values that underly a healthy democracy , like collaboration and empowerment and participation and enterprise , are the same values that underly the internet .
i authored this answer , and a few others .
so back to our friend ben franklin , who , one of his lesser-known accomplishments was that in 1736 he founded the first volunteer firefighting company in philadelphia , called a brigade . and it 's because he and his friends noticed that the city was having trouble keeping up with all the fires that were happening in the city , so in true civic hacker fashion , they built a solution .
it tells us that human beings make noise when they have sex , and it 's generally the woman who makes more noise .
now i 'm not saying that our ancestors were noble savages , and i 'm not saying modern day hunter-gatherers are noble savages either .
all right ? he was perplexed by the sexual swellings of certain primates , including chimps and bonobos , because these sexual swellings tend to provoke many males to mate with the females .
if you 're the kind of guy who has a beer fridge in the garage , you expect a party to happen at any moment , and you need to be ready .
now , why does this matter ?
everyone has to respond to the modern world .
resist this , if you can . don 't do this at home .
we virtualized our operating system environments , and we completed numerous automation projects .
now over almost eight years , they 've outperformed by about two thirds .
it 's eyes rolling , eyes rolling .
what if there isn 't enough clean air and fresh water ?
because it 's an important principle .
i kept thinking , can it really have taken us over 2,000 years to come to terms with that simple notion as being our minimum expectation of each other ?
the most ardent of libertarians might argue that donoghue v. stevenson should have been thrown out of court and that stevenson would eventually have gone out of business if he 'd continued to sell ginger beer with snails in it .
what is complex ?
in fact , it 's a little different , and to explain , i need to tell you a short story about myself .
so what we do is take all these data from all these different days and pool them together to extract a long-term association pattern by applying techniques with network analysis to get a complete picture of the social structure of the colony .
instead , it formed a single , cohesive social unit , which allowed the colony to survive that season and thrive again in the next two years .
moving meerkats are like random particles whose unique rule is one of alignment .
nicolas perony : i 'm okay , thanks .
what 's changed ?
we have to go to interactive virtual laboratories and gamification .
" hmm . "
so here 's what we can do .
what are some key ideas that makes all of this work ?
your computer is grading all the exercises .
fifth is peer learning .
finally , i would like to have you dream with me for a little bit .
the way we organize is based on two pillars .
for any new requirement , you have a dedicated function in charge of aligning engineers against the new requirement .
you know , the repairability issue is a cooperation problem .
improve interpersonal feelings , the more people like each other , the more they will cooperate .
when there are too many layers people are too far from the action , therefore they need kpis , metrics , they need poor proxies for reality .
it changes everything .
this is the modern middle east , where two millennia after the coming of christ , virgin births are still a fact of life .
shereen el feki : louder , i can 't hear you .
this is because honor killings are a real threat for untold numbers of women in the arab region .
double standards for men and women , sex as a source of shame , family control limiting individual choices , and a vast gulf between appearance and reality : what people are doing and what they 're willing to admit to , and a general reluctance to move beyond private whispers to a serious and sustained public discussion .
in the arab region , they brand these attempts as a western conspiracy to undermine traditional arab and islamic values .
thank you .
and so we look for a way out .
being lonely .
when we look back through history at all those who have sought an elixir in the past , the one thing they now have in common is that they 're all dead .
but again , there are skeptics who doubt whether legacy really is immortality .
long john silver is not afraid of you finishing your copy of " treasure island . "
well , those of you who have ever seen or touched snow , you know that it 's really light , because it 's just a bunch of tiny ice crystals clumped together , and it 's mostly air .
so how do you map a cave ?
brent named this cave pure imagination , i think because the beautiful sights we saw in there were beyond what we could have ever imagined .
and so this talk is going to be for him .
in fact , it is said that in the collective consciousness of africa , we get to experience the deepest parts of our own humanity through our interactions with others .
so we took them up to his house , and this visit of the philanthropist to his house coincided with a time when solly 's wife , who was learning english , was going through a phase where she would open the door by saying , " hello , i love you .
my foot goes down its throat . it spits me out .
in a more collective society , we realize from the inside that our own well-being is deeply tied to the well-being of others .
and i watched as the matriarch drank , and then she turned in that beautiful slow motion of elephants , looks like the arm in motion , and she began to make her way up the steep bank .
and so of course there 's the mixed emotions .
however , there is a problem with that , that market economy needs inequality of income in order to work .
they also have great capacity .
this is not a technological issue , and we should remember that in no constitution parking is a constitutional right when we make that distribution .
only in 1925 , almost 7,000 children were killed by cars in the united states .
in my country of colombia , almost half the homes in cities initially were illegal developments .
this video shows the actual hunting viewsheds of male lions on the left and females on the right .
this is what a rainforest might look like as you fly over it in a hot air balloon .
the colors are going to be going from red to blue .
the amazon was so dry in 2010 that even the main stem of the amazon river itself dried up partially , as you see in the photo in the lower portion of the slide .
so what we 've been doing is using the laser-guided spectroscopy from the cao to map for the first time the biodiversity of the amazon rainforest .
that 's giving park managers a very first opportunity to use tactical management strategies that are more nuanced and don 't lead to those extremes that i just showed you .
so eric , come on over .
so this is the kind of simple level , right ?
okay , on the count of three , you 're going to go .
i didn 't see anybody sending text messages or checking their email while we were playing , so you were totally content to be playing .
win one thumb once , you will become a grandmaster .
you 've got to date around .
so if i have two possible strategies at this point i 'm sort of figuring out .
these algorithms had a sea full of men that wanted to take me out on lots of dates -- what turned out to be truly awful dates .
there were just bad for me .
i also wanted somebody who would weigh 20 pounds more than me at all times , regardless of what i weighed .
she listed her job as teacher .
the other sort of hallmark of the people who do this well is that they 're using non-specific language .
how soon are you going out ? "
they should be fluffy , not hard . "
so finally , to break the deadlock , the philistines send their mightiest warrior down into the valley floor , and he calls out and he says to the israelites , " send your mightiest warrior down , and we 'll have this out , just the two of us . "
he issues this kind of taunt towards this person coming to fight him .
it 's in fact an incredibly devastating weapon .
so here he is , this shepherd , experienced in the use of a devastating weapon , up against this lumbering giant weighed down by a hundred pounds of armor and these incredibly heavy weapons that are useful only in short-range combat .
sticks ? david only has one stick .
because he can 't see him .
so the effect that this stroke could have on mario 's body could be the fact that he couldn 't be able to control the left side of his body .
so immediately , as francesca said , we changed our life .
but we want to share what was the key learning , the key learning that mario drove to us , and it is to consider what you have as a gift and not only what you miss , and to consider what you miss just as an opportunity .
several year later , i managed to successfully fail all of my exams and didn 't really leave school with much to show for at all , and my parents , maybe as a reward , bought me what turned out to be and i came back home about four years later .
and i was told that i wouldn 't be able to do this , that 's the thing that makes you do it .
so for example , we 've created a newspaper , a regular newspaper .
okay . thanks .
what happened , that is , on the night in the year 610 when muhammad received the first revelation of the koran on a mountain just outside mecca ?
and that panicked disorientation , that sundering of everything familiar , that daunting awareness of something beyond human comprehension , can only be called a terrible awe .
they found the perfect antidote to thought and the ideal refuge of the hard demands of real faith .
in fact , most of us do , whether we 're atheist or theist or anywhere in between or beyond , for that matter , what drives us is that , despite our doubts and even because of our doubts , we reject the nihilism of despair .
so the understanding of this great recession was that this was completely surprising , this came out of the blue , this was like the wrath of the gods .
from the dragon-king concept i propose , which is exactly the opposite , that most extreme events so we can be empowered and take responsibility and make predictions about them .
the biggest one was the " new economy " internet bubble in 2000 , crashing in 2000 , the real estate bubbles in many countries , financial derivative bubbles everywhere , stock market bubbles also everywhere , commodity and all bubbles , debt and credit bubbles -- bubbles , bubbles , bubbles .
the chinese market collapsed , but it rebounded .
but with modern encrypting techniques , we have a hash , we publish a public key , and six months later , we release the report , and there is authentication .
i will talk to you today about the failure of leadership in global politics and in our globalizing economy .
we really could sense that there was going to be a major progressive change in greece .
i said , " why ? these are important decisions .
and then we were surprised when every ad hoc new measure didn 't bring an end to the crisis , and of course that made it very easy to look for a whipping boy for our collective european failure , and of course that was greece .
let 's throw democracy at the problem .
europe , despite its recent failures , is the world 's most successful cross-border peace experiment .
and that hurt . that hurt because that , first of all , hurt the younger generation , and not only , many of them are demonstrating outside , but i think this is one of our problems .
so , how did it just do that ?
we added the mathematical model of the pole to that of the quad .
we 've all heard stories of athletes performing feats while physically injured .
the following calculations are made every 20 milliseconds , or 50 times per second .
take this quad , for example .
like all our past creations and innovations , they may be used to improve the human condition or they may be misused and abused .
the second aspect is love .
because , you know , he is everywhere and nowhere on the planet at the same time , and he 's an illuminated being in my mind , and he 's in between reality and virtual reality , so it would make perfect sense to turn this guy into a hologram . "
and , you know , i woke up one morning with a pretty good idea .
and there 's this guy in montreal , another quebecois called carlos monzon , and he 's a very good vfx artist .
they have social knits that are very close .
and using state-of-the-art clean room technology , we 've devised ways that we can actually pull these dnas away from all the rest of the gunk in there , and it 's not surprising to any of you sitting in the room that if i take a mammoth bone or a tooth and i extract its dna that i 'll get mammoth dna , but i 'll also get all the bacteria that once lived with the mammoth , and , more complicated , i 'll get all the dna that survived in that environment with it , so the bacteria , the fungi , and so on and so forth .
remember , this was a highly plastic animal that lived over tremendous climate variation .
and a lot of men literally don 't get beyond the first sentence as a result .
mary is the object . good sentence .
but 's let 's be clear : asking questions about mary is not going to get us anywhere in terms of preventing violence .
perpetrators are much more normal than that , so the question is , what are we doing here what are the roles of various institutions in helping to produce abusive men ?
and by the way , one of the things that really bothers me about some of the rhetoric against feminists and others who have built the battered women 's and rape crisis movements around the world is that somehow , like i said , that they 're anti-male .
now , when it comes to men and male culture , the goal is to get men who are not abusive to challenge men who are .
and all i 'm saying is that we need to break that silence , and we need more men to do that .
we know enough to know that we can easily do that .
i hope that , going forward , men and women , working together , can begin the change and the transformation that will happen so that future generations won 't have the level of tragedy that we deal with on a daily basis .
i think the challenge facing the next generation of architects is , how are we going to turn our client from the one percent to the 100 percent ?
so what you end up with are single , monolithic neighborhoods based on this kind of one-size-fits-all model .
and they 're distributing massively really complex manufacturing capabilities .
one of them is that it 's always incredibly sociable .
so if we 're serious about problems like climate change , urbanization and health , actually , our existing development models aren 't going to do it .
what stops us from making them ?
i 'm a good hippie dad , so i 'm like , " okay , you 're going to learn to love the moon .
you can make one of these brushes just on the fly .
you guys are facing that way , so i 'll hook it to this one .
and then 30 days later , 11,000 people had backed the project .
we didn 't plan for that at all .
and that leads to the suggestion , maybe economic growth is almost over .
this led to a fantasy .
we 've got problems all over our educational system despite race to the top .
central manhattan became possible .
and here 's an interesting ratio : starting from zero in 1900 , only 30 years later , the ratio of motor vehicles to the number of households in the united states reached 90 percent in just 30 years .
you have to choose either option a or option b.
so this was the thinking back then , and these individuals made these holes .
so this looks something like this when it 's in the brain .
so back in 1997 , i was asked to see this young boy , perfectly normal . he has this genetic form of dystonia .
so here you really have the blues , and the areas in blue are areas that are involved in motivation , in drive and decision-making , and indeed , if you 're severely depressed as these patients were , those are impaired . you lack motivation and drive .
now we 're not going to do this in normal people .
so this is now in clinical trials .
in fact , even if producing co2 was good for the environment , given that we 're going to run out of hydrocarbons , we need to find some sustainable means of operating .
so as a result , the energy usage is very low , and it has the most advanced battery pack , and that 's what gives it the range that 's competitive , so you can actually have on the order of a 250-mile range .
and our third generation car , which should hopefully be out in about three or four years will be a $ 30,000 car .
what 's unusual about that ?
em : zero . pay zero up front .
and you really picture a future where a majority of power in america , within a decade or two , or within your lifetime , it goes solar ?
would humanity become a space-faring civilization ?
obviously that doesn 't work very well for — what just happened there ? we just saw something land ?
we dressed a cowboy as johnny cash and bolted the mannequin to the rocket . all right , let 's see that video then , because this is actually amazing when you think about it .
generally i think there are -- what i mean by that is , boil things down to their fundamental truths and reason up from there , as opposed to reasoning by analogy .
what we have here is a painting of the great poet rabbie burns , and it 's just a normal image , but if we now switch inputs over to the phone , running our technology , you can see effectively what tamara 's seeing on the screen , and when she points at this image , something magical happens .
mm : awesome . thank you .
it 's available for everyone to do , and actually i 'm going to show you how easy it is to do by doing one right now .
mm : well done . we 've been aurasma . thank you .
those chips have never been broken , whatever you read in the paper .
and i love that picture .
and so the chatroom thing doesn 't work properly , and it 's a very bad way of thinking about identity .
so the girls just all logged into facebook on their phones , and deleted their profiles .
that gets you security theater , where there 's no actual security , but people are sort of playing parts in a play about security .
and of course , for all those reasons i 've just outlined , it doesn 't , and it might , actually , make some problems worse .
you see what you want to see .
if it means no special gadgets , it has to run on a mobile phone .
we know it works , there are a few examples of the technology being used in experimental places .
and you open the box and you 're like , wow , there 's my goo .
and i started thinking about it again .
wow , what if the products could walk and talk on their own ?
and we deliver them to the side of the building .
if the worker in station three decides to leave and go to the bathroom , it has no impact on the productivity of the other nine workers .
she puts out her hand . the product jumps into it .
well , i 'm not quite sure .
here 's the common-sense idea .
well , clearly there are memories , desires , intentions , sensations , and so forth .
now my science isn 't very good .
there are lots of different processes in the brain , all of which operate , in a way , quite independently .
for one thing , it 's always changing .
the true self , as it were then , is not something that is just there for you to discover , you don 't sort of look into your soul and find your true self , what you are partly doing , at least , is actually creating your true self .
does it come from earth 's natural replenishing resources , such as sun , wind and water ?
we also are using weeds and we are also using algae .
in our greenlab we have six primary ecosystems that range from freshwater all the way to saltwater .
what you see in the lower corner is a wastewater treatment plant experiment that we are growing , a macro-algae that i 'll talk about in a minute .
and so we do g.c. extraction , lipid optimization , so on and so forth , because our goal really is to come up with the next generation of aviation fuels , aviation specifics , so on and so forth .
there 's something missing to be complete .
however , grilled chicken poses a hidden danger .
most of the others either never responded back , said they didn 't have the time or didn 't have the equipment and couldn 't help me .
shree bose : hi everyone . i 'm shree bose .
in fact , one in 70 women will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer .
in fact , it means that if a patient comes in and they 're resistant to this drug , then if we give them a chemical to block this protein , then we can treat them again with the same drug .
but soon after , i developed a novel mathematical model that essentially quantifies the effect of these environmental pollutants on the lung health of asthmatic patients .
and this report really drives home the crux of my research .
thank you .
with my mom by my side and tears streaming down our faces , i strapped on these chunky legs and i stood up .
and this is when i learned that our borders and our obstacles can only do two things : one , stop us in our tracks or two , force us to get creative .
it 's about pushing off of them and seeing what amazing places they might bring us .
i was fascinated by the cold war , over intermediate-range nuclear missiles , the proxy war between the soviet union and the u.s.
it was really interesting .
and i decided to take some time out from work .
and it was like that for me . i love that movie .
it was anarchy .
they were not allowed a foreign office to help them deal with this immensely complicated process , which became known as the final status process of kosovo .
and one thing led to another , and i ended up having a desk in ? what if ! in new york , when i started independent diplomat .
us .
this is terrible that you don 't consult these people who are actually affected .
and my politics has changed fundamentally from when i was a diplomat to what i am today , and i think that outputs is what matters , not process , not technology , frankly , so much either .
a thousand years into this period , we abandon our hunting and gathering patterns .
you see , for the first time , an imprint on the global level .
in fact , you 're not even allowed to stand where this gentleman is standing , at the foaming , slippery waters at the threshold .
in the ' 60s already , through the green revolution and the haber-bosch process of fixing nitrogen from the atmosphere -- you know , human 's today take out more nitrogen from the atmosphere than the whole biosphere does naturally as a whole .
under the realization from tourist operators , fishermen , the australian great barrier reef authority and scientists that the great barrier reef is doomed under the current governance regime .
you get people out of poverty .
there is more information about what 's going on in kenya right now than any one person can manage .
the world has over a trillion hours a year of free time to commit to shared projects .
there is a spectrum between mediocre work and good work , and as anybody who 's worked as an artist or a creator knows , it 's a spectrum you 're constantly struggling to get on top of .
the white group there is the control group ; they change nothing .
this brings me back to the lolcats and to ushahidi .
we can use it to crack each other up , and we 're going to do that .
and we do this every time that a video is uploaded to youtube .
and the song , 18 months old , went back to number four on the itunes charts .
and think carefully about the policies that you attach to that content .
you see , he 's right .
it would be foolish for me to abandon this , because it speaks to my most authentic self . "
we don 't teach american history in britain .
great . now , those over 25 , could you put your hands up if you 're wearing your wristwatch ?
we create our lives symbiotically as we explore our talents in relation to the circumstances they help to create for us .
but it 's what i wanted , and as soon as i left school , i applied to the fire service and i was accepted . "
see , it 's outrageous as a conception , but it [ unclear ] .
and if you 're doing the thing that you love to do , that you 're good at , time takes a different course entirely .
that 's where children experience life .
it 's the same problems in the galapagos , except , obviously , it 's worse here , in some ways , than other places .
they 're comical , they walk upright , and , of course , they 're diligent .
and you can imagine sleeping on fernandina your first night there and you hear this lonesome , plaintful call .
so when i went to study the magellanic penguins , i didn 't have any problems .
why do they do that ? because it 's cheaper , because they don 't pay the real environmental costs .
and what the penguins show us -- and these are all the little dots from where the penguins ' positions were for penguins in incubation in 2003 -- and what you see is some of these individuals are going 800 kilometers away from their nests .
and i just wanted to show you what happened one day when turbo brought in a friend .
they 're all coming in at this time , walking across there , just kind of leisurely coming in .
then why is it that they seem to have something different ?
and by " why " i don 't mean " to make a profit . "
but it 's uninspiring .
nobody bought one .
you know , sometimes you can give somebody all the facts and figures , and they say , " i know what all the facts and details say , but it just doesn 't feel right . "
money was no problem .
he could have said , " that 's an amazing discovery , guys , and i will improve upon your technology , " but he didn 't .
they 're more comfortable making those intuitive decisions that are driven by what they believe about the world and not just what product is available .
they 've never made money .
" i believe , i believe , i believe , " he told people .
and it 's those who start with " why " that have the ability to inspire those around them or find others who inspire them .
however , this would mean having killed 26,267 birds , only in the state of são paulo , only in 2006 .
we 're testing these kinds of simple sensor-network technologies in the home so that any phone that a senior is already comfortable with can help them deal with their medications .
when you pick up the phone , how much tremor are you having , and what is that like , and what is that trend like over a period of time ?
so , we study the holistic health experience of 1,000 seniors over the last 10 years in 20 different countries .
the first boomer actually , we didn 't even wait till 2011 , next year .
we have to shift from this mainframe mentality of healthcare to a personal model of healthcare .
how do we get a personal baseline about what 's going to work for you ?
how do we actually prevent the vast majority of falls from ever occurring in the first place ?
this person on the right is actually living in an assisted living facility .
how do we set a going-to-the-moon goal of dealing with the y2k + 10 problem that 's coming ?
and the bus is taken with a cargo-scanning x-ray , which is the sort of machine you have on borders , which checks for contraband and drugs and bombs and things .
and should that pig have grown , unfortunately it was dead , it would have certainly been dead after i x-rayed it , with the amount of radiation i used anyway .
and i use that sort of technology to create things that are quite beautiful .
but this time i had to use a real body .
in my career i 've had two exposures to radiation , which is two too many , because it stays with you for life .
it 's so basic . it just grows wild .
unfortunately i haven 't got x-ray vision .
so , you 're calling for a global ethic .
but you 've got to realize that this world has changed fundamentally , and the problems that we have cannot be solved by one nation and one nation alone .
and so here is one that kind of goes -- i still just want to draw out on this issue .
gb : i think every religion , every faith , and i 'm not just talking here to people of faith or religion -- it has this global ethic at the center of its credo .
gb : followed my sword will swallow .
if you could get a deal at copenhagen , where people agreed , a , that there was a long-term target for carbon emission cuts , b , that there was short-range targets that had to be met so this wasn 't just abstract ; it was people actually making decisions now that would make a difference now , and if you could then find a financing mechanism that meant that the poorest countries that had been hurt by our inability to deal with climate change over many , many years and decades are given special help so that they can move to energy-efficient technologies , and they are in a position financially to be able to afford the long-term investment that is associated with cutting carbon emissions , then you are treating the world equally , by giving consideration to every part of the planet and the needs they have .
and that 's a big task : persuading all the different countries with the different voting shares in these institutions to do so .
so it allows it to roll .
and here is a similar sculpture .
it 's susceptible to motion by the air currents .
this has a diamond-bottomed lake .
so it can see its environment , and then it can mimic its environment and disappear .
it would also be able to be an open code , so people could interact with it .
who wants to be illogical ?
the difference between arts and sciences is not analytical versus intuitive , right ?
let me say it again another way : science provides an understanding of a universal experience , and arts provides a universal understanding of a personal experience .
where do we want the world to be ?
i want to tell you what i 've been doing a little bit since ... i feel this need to sort of integrate some of the ideas that i 've had and run across over time .
we need to revitalize the arts and sciences of today , we need to take responsibility for the future . we can 't hide behind saying it 's just for company profits , or it 's just a business , or i 'm an artist or an academician .
and so when the rest of the team advanced they found little left . and that night the unit 's commander did a sad duty , and he wrote a condolence letter back to the united states , and he talked about how hard the loss had been on his unit , about the fact that they had lost their bravest soldier , a soldier who had saved their lives many a time .
a robots revolution is upon us .
there 's already a jihadi website that you can go on and remotely detonate an ied in iraq while sitting at your home computer .
they call it war porn .
now , the psychological balancing of those experiences is incredibly tough , and in fact those drone pilots have higher rates of ptsd than many of the units physically in iraq .
they see an 80-year-old grandmother in a wheelchair the same way they see a t-80 tank : they 're both just a series of zeroes and ones .
i review gadgets and stuff .
but nonetheless , if you 're a college kid and you have no money , believe me , this is better than trying to use your cell phone .
but it 's actually really , really cool . you have a choice of phones , and we 're not talking smartphones -- ordinary phones , including a blackberry , that have wi-fi .
now , i 'm leaving the house . dp : i 'm going for a walk -- do you mind ?
i should know not to do technology demos in front of an audience . it 's just , like , absurd .
very , very customizable .
you can say " weather , " and the name of the city you 're going to travel to .
number two . number two . two .
they text me back this : " sean connery , george lazenby , roger moore , timothy dalton , pierce brosnan , daniel craig . "
when you have finished recording , you may hang up . " no !
i think basically it 's like these guys in india with headsets , you know , listening in .
well i guess that was the gist .
phone : yeah , well so when was the last time you used the photocopier ?
maybe we should let phone designers design the phones . "
right , of course . we shake it to erase , like this .
the iphone broke the dyke , the wall .
i want an iphone .
and warren buffet had recommended i do that -- being honest about what was going well , what wasn 't , and making it kind of an annual thing .
why ? well there 's only a few diseases that account for the vast majority of those deaths : diarrhea , pneumonia and malaria .
and more recently you can see it 's just around the equator .
but we have to be careful because malaria -- the parasite evolves and the mosquito evolves .
and so as these elements come together , i 'm quite optimistic that we will be able to eradicate malaria .
we have to change it so that people have equal opportunity .
and the answer is that these variations are absolutely unbelievable .
now , the way the pay system works is there 's two things that are rewarded .
they 're team teaching . they 're constantly improving their teachers .
for example , new york passed a law that said that the teacher improvement data could not be made available and used in the tenure decision for the teachers .
now , we put a lot of money into education , the house version actually had money in it for these data systems , and it was taken out in the senate because there are people who are threatened by these things .
he 's a wonderful humorist . and i 'm going to read you this essay , or an excerpt from it because it really hit home for me .
serious design , serious play , is something else .
now , when i was in my early 20s , i worked in the record business , designing record covers for cbs records , and i had no idea what a great job i had .
and there 's something wonderful about that form of youth , where you can let yourself grow and play , and be really a brat , and then accomplish things .
this is what was in the newspapers and in the new york times .
and what happened was that new york city , to a degree , ate my identity because people began to copy it .
this is the children 's museum in pittsburgh , pennsylvania , made out of completely inexpensive materials .
but it became the end of the seriousness of the play , and it started to , once again , become solemn .
so during this time i needed some kind of counterbalance for this crazy , crazy existence of going to these long , idiotic meetings .
i was actually in this solemn landscape of fulfilling an expectation for a show , which is not where i started with these things .
you know , this way you could go to the container store and buy one of those metal sheets that they hang on the back of your door , in your closet , and you could literally stick your shoes up instead of using a shelf .
this is the magnetically-levitating board that they mentioned in the commercial .
now , the interesting thing about this is , you don 't have to be an engineer to appreciate why a 10-foot pole that can fit in your pocket is so interesting .
so here , come on up to the front . all right , so now if you 'll see here -- no , no , it 's ok .
while he was doing this , he noticed an unexpected thing .
new milk carton : i 'm new milk .
so that was the six we had for you today , but i hope you 're starting to see why we find these things so fascinating .
the ammonia evaporates and it re-condenses in the other side .
and we think we can make refrigeration something that everybody can have .
i would say not just biological design , but all of the design that we think of as human design .
sb : no , not without .
it doesn 't care about the consequences because it can 't , because it 's just information being copied .
so , let 's see some memes .
sb : pardon ?
they 're using you and me as their propagating , copying machinery , and we are the meme machines .
and like most parasites , it can begin dangerous , but then it coevolves and adapts , and we end up with a symbiotic relationship with this new parasite .
we 'll think we 're choosing these things , but the temes are making us do it .
the fraction of those that get the third replicator .
the genes are forced into producing all this myelin , all the fat to myelinate the brain .
we are the old machines .
and will we get through this third danger point , like we got through the second and like we got through the first ?
and interestingly , as i think back , they were the first true environmentalists .
a very , very beautiful object .
but again , you can see detroit , in yellow at the top , extraordinary consumption , down below copenhagen .
and nature is part of the generator , the driver for this building .
notwithstanding the fact that the building , as a green building , is very much a pioneering building .
well , obviously the building still happened .
but meanwhile , as you know , wonderful protagonists like al gore are noting the inexorable rise in temperature , set in the context of that , interestingly , those buildings which are celebratory and very , very relevant to this place .
the grooves become the kind of green lungs which give views , which give light , ventilation , make the building fresher .
now what form do they take ?
i grew up to study the brain because i have a brother who has been diagnosed with a brain disorder : schizophrenia . and as a sister and later , as a scientist , i wanted to understand , why is it that i can take my dreams , i can connect them to my reality , and i can make my dreams come true ?
it 's all about " right here , right now . "
so i got up and i jumped onto my cardio glider , which is a full-body , full-exercise machine .
but then i immediately drifted right back out into the consciousness -- and i affectionately refer to this space as la la land .
i couldn 't remember the number at work , so i remembered , in my office i had a business card with my number on it . so i go into my business room , i pull out a three-inch stack of business cards .
and in that moment , i knew that i was no longer the choreographer of my life .
during the twentieth century , we witnessed the atrocities of stalin , hitler , mao , pol pot , rwanda and other genocides , and even though the twenty-first century is only seven years old , we have already witnessed an ongoing genocide in darfur and the daily horrors of iraq .
he plotted on a logarithmic scale , going from 100 deaths per 100,000 people per year , which was approximately the rate of homicide in the middle ages . and the figure plummets down to less than one homicide per 100,000 people per year in seven or eight european countries . then , there is a slight uptick in the 1960s . the people who said that rock ' n ' roll would lead to the decline of moral values actually had a grain of truth to that .
hunter-gatherer peoples explicitly go through this train of thought , and will often raid their neighbors out of fear of being raided first .
because we have been doing something right , and it sure would be good to find out what it is .
we heard the other day that everybody 's got a strong opinion about video games .
suzanne r. -- he 's off to the races .
this means that a lot of people are just left completely dissatisfied and incredulous when i attempt to explain consciousness .
he marvels at how he 'll do a magic show , and afterwards people will swear they saw him do x , y , and z. he never did those things .
that 's because the foveal part of your eye , which is the high-resolution part , is only about the size of your thumbnail held at arms length .
you will have seen something like this -- this is the reverse effect .
you don 't know how you do it .
but there 's still a sort of filling in , as we can tell if we look at this .
so now we 're going to be subjects in the experiment .
how many engines on the wing of that boeing ?
flight pilots practice in flight simulators so that they don 't make real mistakes in planes .
the research that my laboratory has been doing , that economists and psychologists around the country have been doing , have revealed something really quite startling to us , something we call the " impact bias , " which is the tendency for the simulator to work badly .
who are these characters who are so damn happy ?
it turns out people do eat hamburgers , and ray croc , for a while , became the richest man in america .
you bring in , say , six objects , and you ask a subject to rank them from the most to the least liked .
we took our monet prints to the hospital .
amnesiacs do exactly the same thing . think about this result .
" what are you doing ? "
the other half of the students are told exactly the opposite : " make your choice . and by the way , the mail is going out , gosh , in two minutes , to england .
hello ? 66 percent of the students choose to be in the course in which they will ultimately be deeply dissatisfied with the picture .
when i was about 24 years old , kate store and myself started an organization to get architects and designers involved in humanitarian work .
2005 mother nature kicked our arse .
so seven years later , we 've developed so that we 've got advocacy , instigation and implementation . we advocate for good design , not only through student workshops and lectures and public forums , but also disaster mitigation and dealing with public policy .
and we started engaging the medical community .
so it 's not an aids clinic . it 's a community center .
so when you come to tedglobal , you can check it out .
figuring out what fema regulations are , not waiting for them to dictate to us how you should rebuild .
more hemp houses -- it 's a theme in japan apparently .
how do we improve the living standards of five billion people ?
that 's too late . we need to do it now .
so it 's important to have these proven ideas put up there , easy to use , easy to get a hold of .
