people that have partnered with us have given us new eyes , not only on what exists -- the new landscapes at the bottom of the sea -- but also how we think about life on the planet itself .
you hear about giant squid and things like that , but some of these animals get up to be approximately 140 , 160 feet long .
the average depth at the top of it is about a mile and a half .
and then we had some hint that these things existed all along the axis of it , because if you 've got volcanism , water 's going to get down from the sea into cracks in the sea floor , come in contact with magma , and come shooting out hot .
he 's managed to grab a tip of these worms .
this is from the atlantic . even greater depth .
the vents are emitting a black body radiation -- an ir signature -- and so they 're able to find these vents at considerable distances .
this bacteria that we 've been talking about turns out to be the most simplest form of life found .
everything on this planet -- everything -- works by cycles and rhythms .
you know , i 'm sick and tired of us not living up to our potential .
last .
let 's go back to the same three areas .
i want to go back to work because i need to further my career or i just want to go have coffees .
what are qualities of a bulgarian work ?
nature isn 't stupid , and it selected for play .
really cool term : neoteny -- the retention of play and juvenile traits in adults .
we hold ourselves back .
for example , it stimulates creativity .
and you 're going to say , " gee , that can work for fedex out there in the united states , but it can 't work in bulgaria .
it does , and it can , work in bulgaria .
and we 're going to do things like eliminate restrictions .
because we can 't do it alone . we have to do it together , and together , if we do this and share these ideas on play , we can transform bulgaria for the better .
and we took a very special angle to this .
we all want to be there , in the upper right quadrant , where performance is strong and learning opportunities are equally distributed .
last but not least , koreans want their teachers not only to teach but also to develop .
and the bitter truth really is that , you know , not in many countries .
well , if you only focus on your brightest students , you know what happens is disparities grow , and you can see this bubble moving slightly to the other direction , but still , an impressive improvement .
those things really exist .
and they provide intelligent pathways for teachers to grow in their careers .
last but not least , those countries align policies across all areas of public policy .
they wrote almost a thousand pages on the topic .
and we perform dozens of integrations in order to understand what 's happening .
and as a body of knowledge builds up , it will form one subsection , or one sub-subsection of an assessment like the ipcc , although we have others .
we don 't have to inject anything . we don 't need radiation .
as they do it , in the upper left is a display that 's yoked to their brain activation of their own pain being controlled .
during the last decade we 've seen a vast integration of global media , now dominated by a culture of the hollywood blockbuster .
technology then meant we had to hire a viewing cinema , find and pay for the print and the projectionist .
by now , these thoughtful , opinionated , curious young people thought nothing of tackling films of all forms -- black and white , subtitled , documentary , non-narrative , fantasy -- and thought nothing of writing detailed reviews that competed to favor one film over another in passionate and increasingly sophisticated prose .
when the sailors mutinied at sea in a demand for humane conditions , it was these teenagers that fed the crew .
we guessed that film , whose stories are a meeting place of drama , music , literature and human experience , would engage and inspire the young people participating in filmclub .
the idea is that if you open up the science and you allow diverse groups to participate , it could really stimulate innovation .
we reverse engineer lab equipment .
i 've actually chosen to take a different kind of risk .
you can make a biocensor out of yeast to detect pollutants in water .
well actually , i 've [ been ] whistling since the age of four , about four .
she didn 't expect me to go there .
and then always the same thing happens : people are watching each other and think , " oh , my god .
okay , here it is .
did you guess the one that was dry ?
we 've certainly seen that today .
the nurses in my department thought that the right approach was the ripping one , so they would grab hold and they would rip , and they would grab hold and they would rip .
and then , like all good academic projects , i got more funding .
i would pass their sheet of paper .
you would expect that as the probability of being caught goes down , people would cheat more , but again , this was not the case .
so , all this was about decreasing the fudge factor .
people see each other behaving .
here is the thing .
of course they would .
so , if you think about all of your intuitions , it 's very hard to believe that your intuition is wrong .
they hand out all kinds of business tax breaks .
as another example , if we look at what determines an individual 's wages , and we do statistical exploration of that , what determines wages , we know that the individual 's wages will depend , in part , on that individual 's education , for example whether or not they have a college degree .
and so they 'll both underinvest because everyone 's going to move out .
so this is an investment that pays off in very concrete terms for a broad range of income groups in the state 's population and produces large and tangible benefits .
so , that 's my first idea . and we all know about the mozart effect -- the idea that 's been around for the last five to 10 years -- that just by listening to music or by playing music to your baby [ in utero ] , that it 'll raise our iq points 10 , 20 , 30 percent .
music can change your life , more than almost anything .
it 's a real experience , not only to learn how to play and listen to rhythms , but to train your musical memory and playing music in a group .
the largest set piece in the opera is called the system . it 's a series of books .
so we met dan about three years ago , three and a half years ago , when we started working at tewksbury . everybody we met there was fantastic , did fantastic music . dan had never made music before , and it turned out he was really fantastic at it . he 's a born composer .
and so that 's what we 'll do today .
tm : ok , now dan will play his piece " my eagle song " for you .
but i also noticed that sometimes the music that i had written , or was writing at the time , didn 't sound all that great in some of those halls .
he can , very innovatively , actually change keys without risking huge dissonances .
obviously , this kind of thing became popular .
so the bands started to improvise new melodies .
there 's live music , and there 's recorded music .
the car is a whole venue .
yeah . i think it 's evolutionary .
that 's the life everyone sees .
and so because we don 't see it , we don 't see the severity of it .
i thought about it every single day , and if i 'm being totally honest , standing here i 've thought about it again since , because that 's the sickness , that 's the struggle , that 's depression , and depression isn 't chicken pox .
i wish i did , but i don 't -- but i think , i think it has to start here .
so we need to stop the ignorance , stop the intolerance , stop the stigma , and stop the silence , and we need to take away the taboos , take a look at the truth , and start talking , because the only way we 're going to beat a problem that people are battling alone is by standing strong together , by standing strong together .
because you have to understand , in israel we don 't talk with people from iran .
it was a huge amount of pictures .
so she said , " everybody in palestine , in where ? israel ?
we 're showing a new reality by just making images because that 's how the world perceives us .
and it goes the other way around .
and maybe that image will help us change something .
a large , unruly fraction of our trash will flow downriver to the sea .
the retainer rings for the caps also have consequences for aquatic animals .
small bits of plastic concentrate persistent organic pollutants up to a million times their levels in the surrounding seawater .
how do you feed a city ?
we 're very hungry for fossil fuels too .
because it was the temples that organized the harvest , gathered in the grain , offered it to the gods , and then offered the grain that the gods didn 't eat back to the people .
fish was , of course , coming in by river as well . same thing .
this is an image of the great western in 1840 .
we just read the back of a label on a packet .
it can either mean a good place , or no place .
because without that , you can 't have this kind of place , food that is grown locally and also is part of the landscape , and is not just a zero-sum commodity off in some unseen hell-hole .
if the city looks after the country , the country will look after the city .
so i can be somebody that can look at this in a totally fresh perspective and see if i can optimize it in its most idealistic fashion .
that 's the trailer , pretty much finished .
all the casework is hand-scribed in , uniquely , so you can 't just cut 100 parts for 100 trailers , you have to cut them big , and every single one is hand-fit .
imagine i were to stroke your child 's arm with this feather , and their brain [ was ] telling them that they were feeling this hot torch .
and when you turn the switch on , the light goes on .
and most importantly , what we do is we use a rigorous , and often uncomfortable , process of physical therapy and occupational therapy to retrain the nerves in the nervous system to respond normally to the activities and sensory experiences that are part of everyday life .
and then finally , we 're going to try to develop and pioneer a new perspective on high seas governance that 's rooted in ocean-basin-wide conservation , but framed in an arena of global norms of precaution and respect .
instead of " go anywhere , do anything you want , " we actually created a regime that required prior assessment of where you 're going and a duty to prevent significant harm .
but what makes the ross sea important is the vast sea of pack ice that in the spring and summer provides a wealth of phytoplankton and krill that supports what , till recently , has been a virtually intact near-shore ecosystem .
but what we also know is that species like these sea turtles do not stay put in the eastern tropical pacific seascape .
we can also tag and track fishing vessels .
i want to share with you over the next 18 minutes a pretty incredible idea .
twenty years later , they succeeded and developed the polio vaccine .
and in one case , it originated on another continent .
now we don 't have a great track record when it comes to doing something like this , to eradicating diseases .
we 've had to create one of the largest social movements in history .
when we started , over 20 years ago , 1,000 children were being paralyzed every single day by this virus .
he lives in a family home there with his eight brothers and sisters .
and in afghanistan , we 're trying new approaches -- access negotiators .
and in the last six months , we 've had less places reinfected by polio than at any other time in history .
bill gates : well bruce , where do you think the toughest places are going to be ?
well , hopefully we 'll get the word out , and the governments will keep their generosity up .
they can be shocking or silly or soulful .
" inside this envelope is the ripped up remains of a suicide note i didn 't use .
and she turned to him and said , " is that our cat ? "
my son 's birth is on this camera .
i have one of my own secrets in every book .
i would give the boy probably about 30 seconds , which means , by the time he got to me , i was already saying things like , " why are you crying ?
my mother , my sister , my auntie , they all get out , but my father and i stayed in the limousine , and no sooner than the women got out , he burst out crying .
his father wasn 't on the set .
you only tell your dearest , closest friend , sworn to secrecy for life , the first time you had sex .
i stand with my back to the door so johnny can 't bust in the room and see that i 'm not doing anything , and i stand there long enough that i could have actually done something .
i need you working with me and me working with you on how we raise our sons and teach them to be men -- that it 's okay to not be dominating , that it 's okay to have feelings and emotions , that it 's okay to promote equality , that it 's okay to have women who are just friends and that 's it , that it 's okay to be whole , that my liberation as a man is tied to your liberation as a woman .
they give 20 minutes -- that 's a time warning .
you fall outside the door , you 're caught in the slipstream .
i always landed like a watermelon out of a third floor window .
one of my first battalion commanders , i worked in his battalion for 18 months and the only conversation he ever had with lt. mcchrystal was at mile 18 of a 25-mile road march , and he chewed my ass for about 40 seconds .
a 22-year-old individual operating alone , thousands of miles from me , has got to communicate to me with confidence .
i asked , " where were you on 9 / 11 ? "
think about knowing that over time .
that was my journey .
then i immediately asked her , why are you [ using ] that unhygienic method ?
" close your eyes . whatever i give , it will be not a diamond pendant not a diamond ring , even a chocolate , i will give you a surprise with a lot of tinsel paper rolled up with it .
that makes me to want to refuse to continue this research and research and research .
that makes me a visiting professor and guest lecturer in all iims .
mahalakshmi is chasing me , i am keeping in the back pocket .
if we extrapolate back , we find we must have all been on top of each other about 15 billion years ago .
but we don 't know how life first appeared .
our only chance of long-term survival is not to remain lurking on planet earth , but to spread out into space .
i sat down next to a stout , middle-aged man with owl glasses and a bow tie , and he turned out to be a fulbright scholar , there in china specifically to study sino-soviet relations .
and for years , it seemed like we were succeeding .
this time , there 's new treatments on the horizon .
it was the kind of fight and the kind of choices that everyone here agrees pump up the cost of end-of-life care , and of healthcare for all of us .
now , what do the experts call this ?
you just redefine denial and hope , and it becomes a feature of being human .
this is a poem about mark antony .
you know , there 's a small country nestled in the himalayan mountains , far from these beautiful mountains , where the people of the kingdom of bhutan have decided to do something different , which is to measure their gross national happiness rather than their gross national product .
there are eight times more tractors in latin america , and three times more tractors in asia , than in africa .
like its agriculture , africa 's markets are highly under-capitalized and inefficient .
that in turn , because of the weak marketing system , led to an 80 percent collapse in maize prices in the country .
in fact , in 1848 , 82 grain merchants and farmers got together in a small town at the crossroads of the illinois river and lake michigan to establish a way to trade better amongst themselves .
we 're creating a system that serves all market actors , that creates integrity , trust , efficiency , transparency and enables small farmers to manage the risks that i have described .
it will also transform the way traders do business .
when i was seven years old and my sister was just five years old , we were playing on top of a bunk bed .
and you could see how my poor , manipulated sister faced conflict , as her little brain attempted to devote resources to feeling the pain and suffering and surprise she just experienced , or contemplating her new-found identity as a unicorn .
scientists change the answer to " how fast does the average child learn how to read in that classroom ? "
see what we 're finding is it 's not necessarily the reality that shapes us , but the lens through which your brain views the world that shapes your reality .
and if we change it , if we change our formula for happiness and success , what we can do is change the way that we can then affect reality .
that undergirds most of our parenting styles , our managing styles , the way that we motivate our behavior .
in just a two-minute span of time done for 21 days in a row , we can actually rewire your brain , allowing your brain to actually work more optimistically and more successfully .
i 'll never do it again . "
so i started thinking about how do we experiment with this idea of the fruits of our labor .
so in the second condition of this experiment , that 's exactly what we did .
people who were just given the description of the experiment said that in the meaningful condition people would probably build one more bionicle .
and everybody raised their hand .
and we had three conditions .
would the ignored condition be more like the acknowledged or more like the shredder , or somewhere in the middle ?
people did not want them .
you worked for us , but i 'll tell you what , we 'll sell it to you .
when you looked at the hard instructions , the effect was larger .
which comes to tell you one more thing , which is , much like our builders , when they look at the creature of their creation , we don 't see that other people don 't see things our way .
because everyone these days wants to know how to slow down , but they want to know how to slow down really quickly . so ...
you know , a burnout , or eventually the body says , " i can 't take it anymore , " and throws in the towel .
you think of , you know , urbanization , consumerism , the workplace , technology .
started in italy , but has spread across the world , and now has 100,000 members in 50 countries .
you can get more bang for your buck , let 's say .
and in harvard , for instance , they send out a letter to undergraduates -- freshmen -- telling them that they 'll get more out of life , and more out of harvard , if they put on the brakes , if they do less , but give time to things , the time that things need , to enjoy them , to savor them .
you know , i got stuck on the m25 , which is a ring road around london , recently , and spent three-and-a-half hours there . and i can tell you , that 's really bad slow .
and the upshot of all of that is that i actually feel a lot happier , healthier , more productive than i ever have .
i am a reformed marketer , and i now work in international development .
and as a marketer , i found that curious .
it was a great place to grow up , but it 's one of the most vulnerable spots in the world .
but while there might be some short-term individual winners , our collective losses will far outweigh them .
farmers are facing challenges of drought from asia to africa , from australia to oklahoma , while heat waves linked with climate change have killed tens of thousands of people in western europe in 2003 , and again in russia in 2010 .
imagine the staggering cost of protecting this vital infrastructure with levees .
it 's up to us to look at our homes and our communities , our vulnerabilities and our exposures to risk , and to find ways to not just survive , but to thrive , and it 's up to us to plan and to prepare and to call on our government leaders and require them to do the same , even while they address the underlying causes of climate change .
turn your head this way ; shoot ; and you 're bound to kill something .
and , worse , not only did we see buildings that were very generic -- so , not only does the reading room look like the copy room look like the magazine area -- but it meant that whatever issue was troubling the library at that moment was starting to engulf every other activity that was happening in it .
the things on the -- on the left-hand side of the diagram , those are the boxes .
and i think what 's important is , when we first unveiled the building , the public thought -- saw it as being totally about our whim and ego .
so , it 's very indiscernible , but it 's actually a continuous stair stepping .
this is the theater up close .
and it also charged us with thinking about how to have something that was both a single building and a credible sort of sub-building .
so here you can see that these -- this -- sort of an x-ray -- the towers are totally developer-driven . they told us the dimensions , the sizes and so forth and we focused on taking all the public components -- the lobbies , the bars , everything that the different commercial elements would have -- and combined it in the center , in the sort of subway map , in the transfer zone that would also include the contemporary art museum .
i 'm going to talk about why we are so fatalistic about doing anything about aging .
it 's a traditional part of the way of life , and we should be allowed to carry on doing it .
and you know , a lot of people try to fudge this question , and give answers like this .
and the fundamental reason , i think , why we feel that aging is inevitable is summed up in a definition of aging that i 'm giving here .
before i tell you why it isn 't , i 'm going to go a little bit into what i 'm calling step two .
you can look at medical care . i mean , hygiene , vaccines , antibiotics -- you know , the same sort of time frame .
but irrespective of that age , i 'm claiming that the first person to live to 1,000 -- subject of course , to , you know , global catastrophes -- is actually , probably , only about 10 years younger than the first 150-year-old .
so , i say that we have a 50 / 50 chance of reaching this rhr milestone , robust human rejuvenation , within 15 years from the point that we get to robust mouse rejuvenation .
we can call it the " engineering approach , " and i claim that the engineering approach is within range .
what can damage accumulate in ?
there 's a proposal to actually put together an institute .
if i project that , that would make me think that i would live until 120 if i don 't crash on my motorbike .
and then a thought came across my mind : if things go pear-shaped on this swim , how long will it take for my frozen body to sink the four and a half kilometers to the bottom of the ocean ?
it 's very , very difficult to breath . you get altitude sickness .
i 've heard it said that drowning is the most peaceful death that you can have .
but i learned two very , very important lessons there on mt . everest , and i thank my team of sherpas who taught me this .
after all , the ancient astronauts who used it did not travel by jet very often , preferring instead to travel by feathered serpent powered by crystal skulls .
oh yes , that 's right , i remember those ; i had my whole bathroom tiles redone with those back in the good old days .
actually , it 's not about death .
i plan to publish my own notebook .
we can never seem to grasp it in its totality .
they say , " of course not , the internet doesn 't weigh anything . "
and the landscape is changing . three years ago , when i started thinking about this , there was one cable down the western coast of africa , represented in this map by steve song as that thin black line .
and then , once it was in the right place , he got back in the water holding a big knife , and he cut each buoy off , and the buoy popped up into the air , and the cable dropped to the sea floor , and he did that all the way out to the ship , and when he got there , they gave him a glass of juice and a cookie , and then he jumped back in , and he swam back to shore , and then he lit a cigarette .
it can 't afford to doubt the person who tends the child .
in a wimbledon final match , these two guys fight it out .
why ? because it is there in everybody .
you cannot be a part of wholeness and still be whole .
to discover compassion , you need to be compassionate .
if you know how to pray , pray .
but that could just be because the submersible has a wider field of view .
ew : the full monty .
okay , glass , record a video .
because we ultimately questioned whether this is the ultimate future of how you want to connect to other people in your life , how you want to connect to information .
so our first prototypes we built were huge .
now it 's evening , and my dinner first grew cold -- and then grew mold .
it may be good technology , but i feel like there 's not enough of a support structure .
with your voices on it !
but what 's the alternative ? microsoft actually did this experiment . they said , " well , wait a minute . everyone complains that we 're adding so many features .
it 's not like the rest of the screen is so full of other components that you need to collapse the choices .
so why is united states in the " u " s ?
you know , i don 't want to just stand here and make fun of microsoft ...
there 's the old one , responsible for windows and office .
don 't cry for me , cupertino . i 've still got the drive and vision .
will you be my power plug ?
and so that 's what they did . this cult of doing things right is starting to spread .
that scarcity led to a crisis in january of this year at the university of johannesburg .
so to put that number in perspective , for andrew to reach that same size audience by teaching a stanford class , he would have to do that for 250 years .
but it 's not just about the numbers , it 's also about the people .
students can traverse this material in different ways , depending on their background , their skills or their interests .
and of course these simple retrieval questions are not the end of the story .
what 's even more surprising is that self-grades , where the students grade their own work critically -- so long as you incentivize them properly so they can 't give themselves a perfect score -- are actually even better correlated with the teacher grades .
so you can turn the study of human learning from the hypothesis-driven mode to the data-driven mode , a transformation that , for example , has revolutionized biology .
in the individual tutoring instruction , 98 percent of the students are going to be above that threshold .
you can see , for example , that the achievement score almost doubles in this particular experiment .
and that when being vulnerable emerged from my data , as absolutely essential to whole-hearted living , i told these 500 people that i had a breakdown .
and i 'm thinking to myself , " brene , what are you doing ? what are you doing ?
i define vulnerability as emotional risk , exposure , uncertainty .
i 'm a fifth generation texan .
i learned about these things from studying shame .
so you know what i did ? i made it . "
and that 's what this conference , to me , is about .
shame : i 'm sorry . i am a mistake .
and it 's a straight-jacket .
very quickly , some research by mahalik at boston college .
well , in the mid- ' 70s , there were not great opportunities for a bioengineer like me , especially in italy , and so i decided , with some researchers from the united states and the university of florence , to start probing the murals decorated by vasari on the long walls of the hall of the 500 searching for the lost leonardo .
well , also , authenticity . just think for a moment if science really could move in the field of authenticity of works of art . there would be a cultural revolution to say the least , but also , i would say , a market revolution , let me add . take this example : otto marseus , nice painting , which is " still life " at the pitti gallery , and just have an infrared camera peering through , and luckily for art historians , it just was confirmed that there is a signature of otto marseus . it even says when it was made and also the location .
we definitely need a new breed of engineers that will go out and do this kind of work and rediscover for us these values , these cultural values that we badly need , especially today .
and with the help of skype , that is what we are going to attempt today .
so my question is , why don 't we ask for the things that we need ?
the guy said , " you know , when you true the wheels , it 's going to make the bike so much better . "
it wasn 't until we really left earth , got above the atmosphere and had seen the horizon bend back on itself , that we could understand our planet as a limited condition .
coming in closer , picking up earth , orbit of the moon , and we see the earth .
and to be able to see our context in this larger sense at all scales helps us all , i think , in understanding where we are and who we are in the universe .
but we also have an equally strong need -- men and women -- for adventure , for novelty , for mystery , for risk , for danger , for the unknown , for the unexpected , surprise -- you get the gist -- for journey , for travel .
but in desire , we tend to not really want to go back to the places we 've already gone .
because sometimes , as proust says , mystery is not about traveling to new places , but it 's about looking with new eyes .
is it a place for naughtiness and is it a place to be safely aggressive ?
and so i began to ask a different question .
they can go off in their imagination , off in their body , off in their playfulness , all the while knowing that there 's somebody when they come back .
on the other hand if you can 't go , you can 't have pleasure , you can 't culminate , you don 't have an orgasm , you don 't get excited because you spend your time in the body and the head of the other and not in your own .
and i decided to explore this movement by turning trees into artists .
we give science lectures , and the men here are choosing to come to our science lectures instead of watching television or weightlifting .
like he said , we 're three brothers from new jersey -- you know , the bluegrass capital of the world .
if we could free ourselves from our education ?
if we take its surfaces and fold them again and again and again and again , then after 16 iterations , 16 steps , we end up with 400,000 surfaces and a shape that looks , for instance , like this .
so , for instance , we can plot the length of the edges .
these forms are undrawable .
from this shape , we calculated a cutting line , and then we gave this cutting line to a laser cutter to produce -- and you 're seeing a segment of it here -- very many thin slices , individually cut , on top of each other .
thank you .
within a year , congress funded huge weapons increases , and we went from 1,200 nuclear weapons to 20,000 .
it 's 29,035 feet high .
and this is what they unloaded for me : i had four yak loads of medical supplies , which are dumped in a tent , and here i am trying to arrange things .
they 're on fixed ropes here .
this looks like a good chance to go for the summit .
so each person climbs individually .
our two strongest climbers , todd burleson and pete athans , decided to go up to try to rescue who they could even though there was a ferocious storm going .
while i was taking care of them , we got more news about rob hall .
this is some severe frostbite on the feet , severe frostbite on the nose .
after laying in the snow that long a time , he got up and found his way back to the camp .
he 's running out of energy .
and then , that energy is sort of spreading throughout his thought areas .
these sherpas believe that if you write prayers on these flags , the message will be carried up to the gods , and that year , beck 's message was answered .
interestingly , one of those birth defects has seen a 200 percent increase in the u.s.
but what atrazine does is it turns on an enzyme , the machinery if you will , aromatase , that converts testosterone into estrogen .
the baby bottle scenario proves that we can prevent unnecessary exposure .
in addition to that , after the baby 's born , our other unique invention as mammals is that we nourish our offspring after they 're born .
we are in effect polluting our children .
it shouldn 't come to any surprise that the things that happen in wildlife are also a warning to us , just like rachel carson and others have warned .
and companies that will thrive are those that will actually embrace the fourth g.
you know , i thought it was rather facetious .
and if we can convert all our users to using this , that 's 500 billion liters of water .
i was also hauling gallons of bottles of water up to the seventh floor every day .
discrete moments from our lives are its chapters .
we all know that the internet has shrunk space as well as time .
and therein lies its greatest convenience and horror .
we want to clutch , and we are left instead clutching at a series of static moments .
we 've seen again and again just how creative technology can be , and in our lives and in our actions , we can choose those solutions and those innovations and those moments that restore the flow of time instead of fragmenting it .
but the first time that i took my book out of my suitcase , the coolest girl in the bunk came up to me and she asked me , " why are you being so mellow ? " -- mellow , of course , being the exact opposite of r-o-w-d-i-e .
it 's different from being shy .
now in fact , some of our transformative leaders in history have been introverts .
steve wozniak invented the first apple computer sitting alone in his cubical in hewlett-packard where he was working at the time .
but in america 's early days , we lived in what historians call a culture of character , where we still , at that point , valued people for their inner selves and their moral rectitude .
i have a suitcase full of books .
but now all of a sudden my job is very different , and my job is to be out here talking about it , talking about introversion .
okay , number two : go to the wilderness .
and so , i fused together the two things i loved the most , which was skiing and windsurfing .
and then i saw this quote : " advertising is the price companies pay for being unoriginal . "
and it 's done in a very simple way : one just touches the base of the light , and on one side , you can mix the brightness , and on the other , the coloration of the light .
you know , there is some push and pull , but design is really helping define the whole experience from the inside out .
in nigeria , people carry their most precious belongings on their heads .
in fact , you can see each logo is a little bit different .
i was in these venues , and people were , you know , really into getting them . they were excited .
and so i was always hearing them talk about their lives and how inspiring they were , and they were really sort of the most hard-working and constantly inspiring people i knew .
so we thought , " we 'll have all these writers and editors and everybody -- sort of a writing community -- coming into the office every day anyway , why don 't we just open up the front of the building for students to come in there after school , get extra help on their written homework , so you have basically no border between these two communities ? "
so we opened this place . and this is a vat that we fill with treasures that students dig in .
she took over as executive director .
they 're seeing adults . they 're modeling their behavior .
so we started bringing in classes during the day .
the teacher tells them what to do , how to do it , what their training is , what their project is so far .
and this became an ongoing thing . more and more books .
and then right beyond -- there 's usually a little chain there -- right beyond , they would see the kids being tutored .
because they have to do it hand on heart and everything .
addicted to video games and tv . couldn 't concentrate at home .
all right , i 've got a minute . so , the ted wish : i wish that you -- you personally and every creative individual and organization you know -- will find a way to directly engage with a public school in your area and that you 'll then tell the story of how you got involved , so that within a year we have a thousand examples -- a thousand ! -- of transformative partnerships .
you can do and use the skills that you have .
and if you think of dogs for example , dogs are now intentionally-designed creatures .
none of this is photoshopped . these are real creatures .
these are zebra fish that have been genetically engineered to be yellow , green , red , and they are actually available now in certain states .
so with antithrombin in that goat -- that goat has been genetically modified so that the molecules of its milk actually include the molecule of antithrombin that gtc genetics wants to create .
they have a computer chip strapped to their backs , and they can fly these creatures around the lab .
the computer learned what the monkey brain did to move its arm in various ways .
this is a mouse created by charles vacanti of the university of massachusetts .
do we get to create organic robots , where we remove the autonomy from these animals and turn them just into our playthings ?
he then counteracts and avoids toppling over by turning the motors appropriately .
for now , it 's an experiment , but let me show you some possible future applications .
what i am is a doctor of internal medicine who became passionately interested in this topic about 10 years ago when a patient asked me a question .
two-thirds of women in their 40s have dense breast tissue , which is why mammography doesn 't work as well in them .
the u.s. has invested four billion dollars converting to digital mammography equipment , and what have we gained from that investment ?
and physicists have all kinds of solutions for things that they don 't realize are problems .
and you can see that it looks a lot different .
here 's an example from that screening study .
after achieving what we felt were remarkable results , our manuscript was rejected by four journals .
so it takes 10 or more years for any screening method to demonstrate a reduction in mortality from breast cancer .
so , i started this exploration around eight years back , and it literally started with a mouse on my desk .
among all these experiments , there was one thing in common : i was trying to bring a part of the physical world to the digital world .
whatever you 're doing with your hands , it 's understanding that gesture .
your newspaper will show you live weather information rather than having it updated -- like , you have to check your computer in order to do that , right ?
when i come back to my desk i can just pinch that information back to my desktop so i can use my full-size computer .
we will provide all the open source software for them , maybe starting next month .
nice show . man , that was good !
bf : ok . dh : oh ! all right .
dh : please stand up , richard .
ok , hold on .
bf : that 's cool . i always wanted to try that .
bf : he invented the pencil .
dh : then here we go .
wow , wow , ok , stop .
bf : richard you tell him , it 's your last year .
dh : where , barry ? where ? tell us , barry .
bf : thank you guys !
i 'm not ready for joint replacement . "
we 've now done that procedure , and it 's been done worldwide in over 4,000 cases , so it 's an fda-approved and worldwide-accepted way to regrow the meniscus .
we can harness those benefits .
there 's six million species of insects on this planet , six million species .
even larger animals eat insects .
and that 's your view of a tomato .
and if you look at the figures up there , it says that we have a third more mouths to feed , but we need an agricultural production increase of 70 percent .
that means that pigs also share diseases with us .
so that 's three points for insects .
it 's just very good food .
and maybe by 2020 , you 'll buy them just knowing that this is an insect that you 're going to eat .
md : thank you .
and ... wikipedia is fixed , finally .
they recognize : both of these things have to live together .
and then , of course , people from san fransisco saw it .
js : copyright policy isn 't just about how to incentivize the production of a certain kind of artistic commodity ; it 's about what level of control we 're going to permit to be exercised over our social realities -- social realities that are now inevitably permeated by pop culture .
this guy is no republican .
actually , it 's not a right-wing nonprofit , but of course -- let me just tie it here -- the creative commons , which is offering authors this simple way to mark their content with the freedoms they intended to carry .
and i felt like i was in third grade again .
it 's a value respecting the creator .
currently , right now , thousands of workers are abandoned .
there 's silence .
but if you 're a virus and you see this , you cross those little legs of yours and you think , " we rock . "
there are two ways : on the left is what we call the lytic way , where the viruses go right in and take over the cells .
but here 's the thing . there are plenty of people in science education who would look at this and say there 's no way that we could ever give that to students , because it contains some language that isn 't completely accurate .
but just as important is knowing which details we should leave out so that the main point still comes across .
how should you start ?
we don 't build this production equipment any longer in the u.s. , unfortunately .
don 't listen to the people who say you can 't do this , because anyone can .
in case you 're finished with toilet paper , you can tear off the inside of the wall .
those are invisible .
so i proposed my idea to improve the situation using these recycled paper tubes because this is so cheap and also so strong , but my budget is only 50 u.s. dollars per unit .
so we spent five weeks rebuilding the church .
so i proposed to the mayor , i 'd like to rebuild the temporary auditorium .
now i am working in new zealand , christchurch .
it 's in the northeastern part of ethiopia .
with the help of the locals and using just shovels and picks , i made my way .
let 's go somewhere else . "
you don 't see that in chimpanzees , and you don 't see this very projecting canine .
in chimps , by age three , the brain is formed over 90 percent .
to summarize the significance of this fossil , we can say the following .
that 's because we africans concentrate -- i am from ethiopia , by the way -- we concentrate too much on how we are seen from elsewhere , or from outside .
so we could show the firing rate of that neuron as a function of the animal 's location .
and then , if we put them back in the environment , generally they 're quite good at putting a marker down where they thought that flag or their car was .
he 's probably remembering where his car was in terms of the distances and directions to extended buildings and boundaries around the location where he parked .
blue curtain .
it was the advice that i decided to follow myself when i turned 40 .
now i 'm not talking here just about the bad companies -- the " abattoirs of the human soul , " as i call them .
meditate for half an hour .
lovely though physical exercise may be , there are other parts to life -- there 's the intellectual side ; there 's the emotional side ; there 's the spiritual side .
with the smallest investment in the right places , you can radically transform the quality of your relationships and the quality of your life .
and there 's no notion , no version of human morality and human values that i 've ever come across that is not at some point reducible to a concern about conscious experience and its possible changes .
and we can therefore visualize a space of possible changes in the experience of these beings .
well , consider by analogy , the concept of physical health .
now , if you 're going to play good chess , a principle like , " don 't lose your queen , " is very good to follow .
but if we are in a reflective mood , we can ask , " is this the perfect expression of psychological balance with respect to variables like youth and beauty and women 's bodies ? "
on the left you have edward witten .
it needs people like ourselves to admit that there are right and wrong answers to questions of human flourishing , and morality relates to that domain of facts .
but can you reconcile that ?
good morning .
i was born and raised here in india , and i learned from an early age to be deeply suspicious of the aunties and uncles who would bend down , pat us on the head and then say to my parents with no problem at all , " poor things . you only have three daughters .
by the time i got to beijing in 1995 , it was clear to me , the only way to achieve gender equality was to overturn centuries of oppressive tradition .
he began to come twice a week to my center because women could not go to the mosque .
i also like rock and roll .
we need peace , and we need our leaders to know we will not rest until there is peace .
he looks embarrassed . he backs away .
they have to subvert tradition that once silenced them in order to give voice to new aspirations .
and somewhere in the middle of south dakota , i turn to my friend and i ask her a question that 's been bothering me for 2,000 miles .
i think it 's a problem for each of us as individuals , in our personal and professional lives , and i think it 's a problem for all of us collectively as a culture .
that 's when he falls .
except that then we freak out at the possibility that we 've gotten something wrong .
it means that you think that your beliefs just perfectly reflect reality .
augustine understood that our capacity to screw up , it 's not some kind of embarrassing defect in the human system , something we can eradicate or overcome .
george bush thought he was going to invade iraq , find a bunch of weapons of mass destruction , liberate the people and bring democracy to the middle east .
the theme of this one , as you guys have now heard seven million times , is the rediscovery of wonder .
and all day she walked around only in her underwear .
2010 : a young woman stands before president sirleaf and gives her testimony of how she and her siblings live together , their father and mother died during the war .
it 's disheartening , it 's sad .
i wish that sexual abuse and exploitation in schools would stop . "
i don 't have much to ask of you .
but in the last year , where president sirleaf comes from , her village , we went there to work with these girls .
imagine the teenage farm girl who makes less than a dollar an hour stitching your running shoes , or the young chinese man who jumps off a rooftop after working overtime assembling your ipad .
certain subjects came up over and over : how much money they made , what kind of husband they hoped to marry , whether they should jump to another factory or stay where they were .
their calculations are different .
i looked in the zippered pocket of one , and i found a printed card in english , which read , " an american classic .
i keep it with me to remind me of the ties that tie me to the young women i wrote about , ties that are not economic but personal in nature , measured not in money but in memories .
thanks so much for your talk .
and the great gold vessels of the temple in jerusalem had been taken to babylon .
he 'll let them return to their countries .
this empire is , in fact , the middle east as we now know it , and it 's what shapes the middle east as we now know it .
after alexander , the other empires , babylon declines , falls into ruins , and all the traces of the great babylonian empire are lost -- until 1879 when the cylinder is discovered by a british museum exhibition digging in babylon .
it 's a remarkable example of two different priestly appropriations of the same event , two different religious takeovers of a political fact .
when he has his great celebrations in persepolis , he summons the cylinder and the cylinder is lent by the british museum , goes to tehran , and is part of those great celebrations of the pahlavi dynasty .
it became a great emblem , a great subject of debate about what iran is at home and abroad .
how many of you have seen the alfred hitchcock film " the birds " ?
and in doing so , we were breeding them for parasitism .
and these crows use sticks in the wild to get insects and whatnot out of pieces of wood .
on an entirely different tack , at university of washington , they , a few years ago , were doing an experiment where they captured some crows on campus .
and now , every crow within five kilometers is standing by a sidewalk , waiting to collect its lunch .
then you can come back anytime and get yourself a peanut .
and then , we 're off to the races .
and the reason that this date was so momentous is that what my colleagues , john king and halee fischer-wright , and i noticed as we began to debrief various super bowl parties , is that it seemed to us that across the united states , if you will , tribal councils had convened .
if you focus in on a group like this -- this happens to be a usc game -- and you zoom in with one of those super satellite cameras and do magnification factors so you could see individual people , you would in fact see not a single crowd , just like there is not a single crowd here , but you would see these tribes that are then coming together .
and i want to make the point that as members of society , we need to .
if that 's how you talked , imagine what kind of work would get done .
and the elevator door opened , and they all walked out .
but they value things like fun . and they value creativity .
that 's like , you know , " life sucks . " who wants to talk that way ?
about 25 percent are at stage two , saying , in effect , " my life sucks . "
so i 'm going to sit here in my chair and not do anything . "
" how could we , instead of just polling what asia thinks or what the united states thinks , or who thinks what about obama versus mccain or something like that , what does the entire world think ? "
this is the most devastating epidemic of our time .
this is a microfluidic chip that i developed .
evolution works that way .
and they get up to all sorts of tricks .
and this one is evolved to mimic a glossy metallic surface you see on some beetles .
i don 't know what a dead horse actually smells like , but this one probably smells pretty much like it .
not only will it raise itself to 115 fahrenheit , 43 or 44 degrees centigrade , for two days , but it keeps constant temperature .
and then i put some ultraviolet filters on my camera and took a very , very long exposure with the particular frequencies of ultraviolet light and this is what i got .
there are hundreds of reasons why we can 't be artists right now .
" now you 're showing your true colors , " mom says . she thinks , " why does he take after his dad ? "
that 's right -- a novel , basically , is writing one sentence , then , without violating the scope of the first one , writing the next sentence .
kids don 't do it because someone told them to .
of course , there were kids who had to .
none of my explanations or excuses were heard , and i really got it big time .
unfortunately , the little artists within us are choked to death before we get to fight against the oppressors of art .
so we start to envy them .
some major in art or music and think they can 't write .
sometimes they look like our spouses , but they are not your parents or spouses .
that 's the world i dream of .
so i thought that it will be good to start with it .
and you have a problem making ends meet .
to make a long story short , the gentleman comes into the office , great suit and tie .
so third meeting , arguments are pretty well exercised .
it 's a daily newspaper with a deadline of 4 p.m.
97 percent of all the scheduled repayments came back to us on time .
i will not run , but it 's very important for me who is going to succeed me .
because when you think about the importance , some of the issues that we were talking about last night -- this last session we had about africa and his hypothetical 50 billion dollars destined for africa .
and those can be environmental bonds .
so i really consider myself a storyteller .
and when it finds one of those phrases , it grabs the sentence up to the period , and then automatically tries to deduce the age , gender and geographical location of the person that wrote that sentence .
and then , one by one , in reverse chronological order , they excuse themselves , entering the scrolling list of feelings .
we see people in their twenties are the most prolific , followed by teenagers , and then people in their thirties , and it dies out very quickly from there .
but i 'll spare you that .
the ten themes radiate out and orbit the time capsule .
and it caused me to wonder specifically , if we could make new constellations today , what would those look like ? what would those be ?
the data from this is global news coverage from thousands of news sources around the world .
we can see the stories that bill clinton is taking part in right now .
and you 'll all be able to use it and kind of explore what your own personal mythology might be .
again , we can 't know , but we can be pretty sure that some form of symbolic communication must have been involved .
the prisoner 's dilemma is actually a story that 's overlaid on a mathematical matrix that came out of the game theory in the early years of thinking about nuclear war : two players who couldn 't trust each other .
so she went out and looked at what data she could find .
toyota , instead of treating its suppliers as a marketplace , treats them as a network and trains them to produce better , even though they are also training them to produce better for their competitors .
i believe that the payoff would be very big .
now , the anchor watches you with a strange gaze on his face , and then on the top of it you add , " and thousands of the young people from athens , madrid and new york will demonstrate for social justice , claiming that they are inspired with arabs . "
it seems that generation epsilon is coming .
that thing doesn 't exist in the world .
now there is also another very important dynamic , and this is a dynamic normally analytics don 't see .
now , everybody is talking about his majesty , the internet , and it is also a very useful skill , but don 't rush to label things like facebook revolution , twitter revolution .
my friend 's book , maria stephan 's book , talks a lot about violent and nonviolent struggle , and there are some shocking data .
the reply was , " no , mr president , he 's an anti-communist . "
or take burma and the monks that were blogging out , a country that nobody knew anything about that was happening , until these blogs told the world that there was a repression , meaning that lives were being lost and people were being persecuted and aung san suu kyi , who is one of the great prisoners of conscience of the world , had to be listened to .
combine the power of a global ethic with the power of our ability to communicate and organize globally , with the challenges that we now face , most of which are global in their nature .
or take the girl i met when i was in tanzania , a girl called miriam .
and that young boy believed our promises that we would help people in difficulty in rwanda , and we never did .
they told me that one of their residents , an old lady in her 90s , was seeing things , and they wondered if she 'd gone bonkers or , because she was an old lady , whether she 'd had a stroke , or whether she had alzheimer 's .
i said , " is this like a dream ? "
i said , " there is a special form of visual hallucination which may go with deteriorating vision or blindness .
he 'd had cataract surgery .
this repetition of perception is sometimes called palinopsia .
you know , i was wondering about freudian determinants .
you smell chestnuts roasting .
there is another part of the brain which is especially activated when one sees cartoons .
the mind does its best to organize and to give some sort of coherence to this , but not terribly successfully .
i 'm blind in one eye , and not terribly good in the other .
i became an industrial engineer , engineer in product development , and i focused on appropriate detection technologies , actually the first appropriate technologies for developing countries .
and that 's how it works .
maybe one slight difference : we can train rats at a fifth of the price of training the mining dog .
is " tering , " which , etymologically , refers to the smell of tar .
throughout last year , we 've been -- depending on which intervals you take -- we 've been consistently increasing case detection rates in five hospitals in dar es salaam between 30 and 40 percent .
and i 'm gonna try and do that within the 18-minute time span that we were told to stay within , and to follow the ted commandments : that is , actually , something that creates a near-death experience , but near-death is good for creativity .
and then , i also wasn 't really shining in a certain area that i wanted to be , and you know , you look at those scores , and it wasn 't bad , but it was not certainly predictive that i would one day make my living out of the artful arrangement of words .
and the one my mother asked : how do i make things happen ?
now , i don 't want to ignore the other side of what happens in our universe , like many of our scientists have .
and then we have intentions .
your brother , who 's fallen in trouble , do you take care of him ?
there are also things , quite uncanny , which bring me information that will help me in the writing of the book .
and he said , " well , i guess with everything in life , there 's a place of balance . "
it takes a while , but i have to let go of them and just go there , and be there .
and if there is a partial answer , a more complete answer from me , it is to simply imagine .
and of course , today , we have an entirely new medium to play with , which is this online world .
it was originally written specifically with twitter in mind .
i think that this kind of spontaneous creation of what was coming out of the characters ' voices really lent an authenticity to the characters themselves , but also to this format that she had created of multiple perspectives in a single story on twitter .
it ended , a true narrative conclusion .
rachelle garniez : quand il me prend dans ses bras il me parle tout bas , je vois la vie en rose . il me dit des mots d 'amour , des mots de tous les jours , et ca me fait quelque chose . il est entre dans mon coeur une part de bonheur dont je connais la cause . c 'est lui pour moi . moi pour lui dans la vie , il me l 'a dit , l 'a jure [ pour ] la vie . et des que je l 'apercois alors je sens en moi mon coeur qui bat
so here i was wallowing in a vortex of emotions and depression and what have you , with the enormity of the situation , wanting to go to a place of healing , health and happiness .
and slowly , i moved out of that miserable state of mind .
it 's the power of an image .
do we all share a common origin , in fact ?
if they were peering over your shoulder , you wouldn 't leap back , like that . what about our human ancestry ?
you think you 've got a tough job ?
but eventually , no matter how good you are at digging up the church records , and all that stuff , you hit what the genealogists call a brick wall .
same thing happens to our dna as it 's being passed on through the generations .
no , the dna tells a story that 's very clear .
new york city , chicago , seattle , all under a sheet of ice .
we are in a period of long cultural stasis from a million years ago until around 60,000 to 70,000 years ago .
and when they reached central asia , they reached what was effectively a steppe super-highway , a grassland super-highway .
the field research that we 're doing around the world with indigenous peoples .
we 've just awarded the first legacy grants totaling around 500,000 dollars .
i was basically concerned about what was going on in the world .
and if i took that journey , no matter whether it failed or succeeded , it would be completely irrelevant .
so he was like my hero .
there were 114 people there -- they were mostly my friends and family .
and i 've always spoken to women and children wherever i 've gone .
and thank you to all of them .
i was showing the film , and i remember being in israel and getting it absolutely slaughtered by some guys having watched the film -- that it 's just a day of peace , it doesn 't mean anything .
and i saw him because he was an actor , i was an actor , i had a connection to him , because we needed to get to the press , we needed this attraction , we needed the media to be involved .
and we did , and we traveled around , and we spoke to elders , we spoke to doctors , we spoke to nurses , we held press conferences , we went out with soldiers , we sat down with isaf , we sat down with nato , we sat down with the u.k. government .
but more importantly , we wanted to go back , because these people in afghanistan were the heroes .
and it 's in the six official languages of the united nations .
and i said to him , " mr. brahimi , is this nuts , going for a global truce ?
and when i meet the mothers in so many of these remote places , i 'm really struck by the things that we have in common .
and i think there are really three things we can take away from coca-cola .
they 're good at tapping into that local entrepreneurial talent .
health extension workers can help with so many things , whether it 's family planning , prenatal care , immunizations for the children , or advising the woman to get to the facility on time for an on-time delivery .
let 's listen to this song that coke created for it , " wavin ' flag " by a somali hip hop artist .
they sometimes store grain in it .
so if we can start to understand what people really want in health and development , we can change communities and we can change whole nations .
so what 's the endgame ?
and so if we can learn lessons from the innovators in every sector , then in the future we make together , that happiness can be just as ubiquitous as coca-cola .
you see 12 intelligent computer agents , the little rectangles that are flying in the brain with you .
we 've mapped them into the audio domain , so they 're singing to you .
we hope that all of you will come to see the allosphere .
we shall not bring back a single bit of gold or silver , and not a gem , nor any coal or iron .
beyond that , i didn 't see anyone for 10 weeks .
scott , as many of you will know , was beaten to it by roald amundsen and his norwegian team , who used dogs and dogsleds . scott 's team were on foot , all five of them wearing harnesses and dragging around sledges , and they arrived at the pole to find the norwegian flag already there , i 'd imagine pretty bitter and demoralized .
i certainly would implore you to open the door just a little bit and take a look at what 's outside .
storm trooper costumes . maps of middle earth -- that 's one i hand-drew myself . there 's the dodo skeleton folder .
and actually , by the end of the day , i had a reasonable skull , a moderately good vertebrae and half of a pelvis .
built out of words , it is the engine that drives the plot of his book and also the movie , in which another object is created : a prop that has to represent the thing that hammett created out of words , inspired by the kniphausen hawk , and this represents the falcon in the movie .
my preference is about 70 coats of this -- matte black auto primer .
it 's a group of prop crazies just like me called the replica props forum , and it 's people who trade , make and travel in information about movie props .
one , i can fire a freaking laser at it , which i have already done , to do a 3d scan -- there 's a 3d scan of this falcon .
the only real problem with the ascending aorta in people with marfan syndrome is it lacks some tensile strength .
when we produced that model we turn it into a solid plastic model , as you can see , using a rapid prototyping technique , another engineering technique .
likewise , if you have the artificial valve option , you 're committed to antibiotic therapy whenever you have any intrusive medical treatment at all .
and the very first cad model we made , the surgeons were playing with the plastic model , couldn 't quite figure it out .
we now have a great clinical guidance out on the net .
and still , there are people in the u.k. saying , " yeah , that external aortic root , yeah , it 'll never work , you know . "
i 'm so embarrassed at how cheap it was to get from my idea to me being implanted that i 'm not prepared to tell you what it cost .
when you 're looking around , what do you consider ?
so , keys provide an access to shelter and warmth -- transport as well , in the u.s. increasingly .
and it 's , quite simply , the point of reflection .
so this is -- probably the thing i 'm most passionate about is the research that we 've been doing on illiteracy and how people who are illiterate communicate .
so what i do is , i buy a prepaid card like this .
and this is where they take the stuff that breaks , and they fix it , and they put it back into circulation .
and i look at something like this and it makes me question , if we were to take all the functionality in things like this , and redistribute them around the body in some kind of personal area network , how would we prioritize where to put stuff ?
and i know ted is about big ideas , but actually , the benchmark for a big idea is changing .
but i still think that this -- -- may be this year 's version of this .
and that 's the direct result of eating a western diet .
we 're not born craving whoppers or skittles .
that 's our number . 10 billion .
in fact , when margarine was invented , several states passed laws declaring that it had to be dyed pink , so we 'd all know that it was a fake .
and again , everyone ate local .
new drugs kept them healthy .
we tended gardens , we became interested in organic food , we knew or we were vegetarians .
leading the way -- what 's leading the way ?
70 percent of the agricultural land on earth , 30 percent of the earth 's land surface is directly or indirectly devoted to raising the animals we 'll eat .
ann cooper 's right .
there he 's starting to walk .
character robotics could plant the seed for robots that actually have empathy .
for the last 20 years i 've been designing puzzles .
now , that was my first puzzle . i got hooked .
it 's a very small form , like a joke , a poem , a magic trick or a song , very compact form .
these sorts of designs now go by the word " ambigram . "
if you could pick up the white area , it would look like the figure on the bottom .
okay , so how would you solve this one ?
you know , he does a lot of research before he writes a cartoon .
which separations were mixed up to make those pictures ?
so , we got games like " brain age " coming out for the nintendo ds , huge hit .
that 's his hair . you get a lot of figure-ground problems .
we start from doodles and sketches .
so i think i 'm actually the first one here -- i lead .
techno-archaeology is digging back and finding past miracles that never happened -- for good reason , usually .
i think it adds a huge amount .
i did that as a quick back page -- i had like four hours to do a back page for an issue of the lampoon , and i did that , and i thought , " well , i 'm ashamed . i hope nobody knows it . "
this is a tiny joke -- e-zr pass . one letter makes an idea .
today , i 'd like to show you something which came out of these collaborations .
you heard her , go ahead .
and , in the fall , i 'm actually going to -- i exchange marriage vows with my beloved . thank you very much .
well , first of all , we 're all incredibly good-looking -- -- graduated high school , college , post-graduate degrees , traveled to interesting places , didn 't have kids in your early teens , financially stable , never been imprisoned . ok .
the south bronx , which lies in between , did not stand a chance .
think bike shops , juice stands .
anyway , i know chris told us not to do pitches up here , but since i have all of your attention : we need investors . end of pitch .
a parade of government subsidies is going to proposed big-box and stadium developments in the south bronx , but there is scant coordination between city agencies on how to deal with the cumulative effects of increased traffic , pollution , solid waste and the impacts on open space . and their approaches to local economic and job development are so lame it 's not even funny .
if you 're a mayor , you can do something about that .
his response was a grant program .
now , i was thinking about that and i said , you know , we 've got this immune response to this ridiculous molecule that we don 't make , and we see it a lot in other animals and stuff .
you can stick this to something called a dna aptamer .
in the developing world , she said , they had two billion people .
and the most successful of the developing countries , they have moved on , you know , and they have become emerging economies , we call them .
this is what we will find there .
but look , this is the world my teacher talked about in 1960 : one billion western world here -- high child-survival , small families -- and all the rest , the rainbow of developing countries , with very large families and poor child survival .
it can be done .
lothar meggendorfer put his foot down , and he said , " genug ist genug ! "
and they remembered a man , one amazing german , every time a new storytelling device popped up next .
you charge another inmate to clean his cell .
come on , raise your hands .
the bad news here is that , for every unit of energy we use , we waste nine .
in fact , it already is .
now thankfully , some of the world 's best material scientists are looking to replace coal with sustainable resources like these , and this is both fantastic and essential .
it told us we were using twice as much energy as our neighbors . "
and for them , autism was devastating .
and they learn soon enough , even before they can utter one word that they can take that attention and move somewhere in order to get things they want .
now remember that we learn a great deal by sharing experiences .
it 's not that that window closes . it doesn 't .
we can see moment by moment what children are engaging with .
it 's very much like they brought into this world the reflex that orients them to people , but it has no traction .
but this is a strength , if you 're working , for example , in technology .
that their parents be less tired and less stressed .
david said when they brought this system into their home , the family meetings in particular increased communication , decreased stress , and made everybody happier to be part of the family team .
inevitably , people began taking some of these techniques and applying it to their families .
everyone throws out suggestions and then we pick two to focus on .
so what did we learn ?
i 'm not home , can 't make family dinner ?
it 's easier , and frankly , we 're usually right .
to me that is a certified agile miracle .
what values do we most uphold ?
as the author of the study told me , children who have a sense of -- they 're part of a larger narrative have greater self-confidence .
greatness is not a matter of circumstance .
commodity prices are like this .
so if you look at this in the context of visualizing the bailout , what you can see is if you stack up dollar bills , first of all , 360,000 dollars is about the size of a five-foot-four guy .
dentists report molars , you know , people grinding their teeth , coming in and reporting the fact that they 've had stress .
so let 's look at some examples of this déclassé consumption that falls out of this value .
zynga has risen on the consumer 's desire to not want to be locked in to fixed-cost .
also a really interesting company is gore-tex .
we see that with the phenomenon of raising backyard hens and chickens and ducks . and when you work out the math , they say it doesn 't work , but the principle is there that it 's about being sustainable and taking care of yourself .
also this rise of local currencies .
so that becomes a very powerful force for them to make their brand more elastic .
so , when we look back and step out at this and see the beginning of these trends that we 're seeing in our data , we see a very hopeful picture for the future of america .
i played a lot of chess .
or paul baran , and his vision for packet switching .
and if you go on the diagonal , you get content and form -- and then beauty and truth .
what 's happening is , the art form is colliding with the given technology , whether it 's paint on stone , like the tomb of the scribe in ancient egypt , or a bas-relief sculpture rising up a stone column , or a 200-foot-long embroidery , or painted deerskin and tree bark running across 88 accordion-folded pages .
adjacent spaces were no longer adjacent moments , so the basic idea of comics was being broken again and again and again and again .
it will adapt . it will adapt to its environment : it 's a durable mutation .
so , basically we have public leaders , public officials who are out of control ; they are writing bills that are unintelligible , and out of these bills are going to come maybe 40,000 pages of regulations , total complexity , which has a dramatically negative impact on our life .
and one of the things i 'm most proud of is this agreement for ibm .
make clarity , transparency and simplicity a national priority .
and we can just ask : " what are the names of santa 's reindeer ? " and be told instantly -- or anything else we want to ask .
and it frees up the nurses and the nurse 's aides from doing that mundane work of just mechanically pushing stuff around to spend more time with patients .
so a person that 's interacting with the robot understands where it 's going to reach and isn 't surprised by its motions .
so as we continue here , i want to tell you about what this is like in factories .
there 's two great forces that are both volitional but inevitable .
and so i really think that we 're going to be spending more time with robots like baxter and working with robots like baxter in our daily lives . and that we will -- here , baxter , it 's good .
so it was pretty interesting stuff .
they keep doing it ; they just keep making these things .
well we tried and tried and we couldn 't really get anything else out of it .
and so here was the first soft tissue from a dinosaur .
so the non-avian dinosaurs are the big clunky ones that went extinct .
i mean , that 's -- that 's definitely genetic modification .
a fellow by the name of matthew harris at the university of wisconsin in madison actually figured out a way to stimulate the gene for teeth , and so was able to actually turn the tooth gene on and produce teeth in chickens .
and so what we 're looking for is that gene .
marco tempest : what i 'd like to show you today is something in the way of an experiment .
we willingly enter fictional worlds where we cheer our heroes and cry for friends we never had .
jokes lead us down a path to an expected destination .
our stories make us the people we are and , sometimes , the people we want to be .
but upon arrival there , in the fall of 1986 , and doing a lot of interviews , i found that the only thing i was offered was to be assistant to the art director at alfred a. knopf , a book publisher .
now the hepburn book was written in a very conversational style , it was like she was sitting across a table telling it all to you .
that was a relief to see that pour out of the machine .
and david especially loved this design because at book signings , which he does a lot of , he could take a magic marker and do this .
this particular story by osama tezuka is his epic life of the buddha , and it 's eight volumes in all . but the best thing is when it 's on your shelf , you get a shelf life of the buddha , moving from one age to the next .
then he 'd run his hand over the rag paper , and the pungent ink and the deckled edges of the pages .
so even though we love publishing as an art , we very much know it 's a business too , and that if we do our jobs right and get a little lucky , that great art can be great business .
isn 't that cool ?
now , i know why i 'm here .
i knew i would find her someday , or we would find each other .
my son , i don 't know where he is .
and aicha started , and she said , " i don 't know if my son is guilty or innocent , but i want to tell you how sorry i am for what happened to your families .
i started a site called treehugger -- i care about this stuff .
it 's called weekday veg .
and something festered inside me after this happened .
and so we just heard about the dna sequencing .
and fortunately , in the course of this project , the transplant surgeons and the other people decided , forget common practice . we have to switch .
and it may be that probiotics can help prevent the development of this horrible necrotizing enterocolitis in these premature infants .
we even went to the international society of endocrinology meeting as family in quebec .
and a sea that 's just filled and teeming with jellyfish isn 't very good for all the other creatures that live in the oceans , that is , unless you eat jellyfish .
and lots of generations , lots of tweaking and torquing , and we turn our puffer into the mola .
and in the mediterranean , in the swordfish net fisheries , they make up up to 90 percent .
we 're tagging on the california coast , and we 're tagging over in taiwan and japan .
and over in these places , the molas are caught in set nets that line these countries .
they 're super industrious .
and sure , it may be just one big old silly fish , but it 's helping .
and i found one section amongst all of these that actually resembled the outline of the united states of america , which you can see here .
and in this i really wanted it to resemble an early still-life painting , so i spent some time with the smells and items .
and the air armament center at eglin air force base in florida is responsible for the deployment and testing of all air-delivered weaponry coming from the united states .
it 's called the world church of god .
i 'll give you an example from a case .
larry mayes , i photographed at the scene of arrest , where he hid between two mattresses in gary , indiana , in this very room to hide from the police .
that 's it . thank you .
and this enabled us to do a really interesting kind of analysis , because it allowed us to compare the predictions of people , say , 18 years old , to the reports of people who were 28 , and to do that kind of analysis throughout the lifespan .
it bedevils our decision-making in important ways .
the one constant in our life is change .
every one of these cells is an incredible electrical device .
and it also will affect normal circuits as well as the abnormal ones that you want to fix .
when blue light hits it , it opens up a little hole and allows charged particles to enter the eye-spot , and that allows this eye-spot to have an electrical signal just like a solar cell charging up a battery .
now i want to tell you a couple of short stories about how we 're using this , both at the scientific , clinical and pre-clinical levels .
it 's called pavlovian fear conditioning -- where a tone ends with a brief shock .
and we 've now surveyed organisms from all over the tree of life -- every kingdom of life except for animals , we see slightly differently .
in its early days -- these have not been done on humans yet -- but we 're working on a variety of studies to try and examine this , and so far we haven 't seen overt reactions of any severity to these molecules or to the illumination of the brain with light .
he 's swimming down every avenue until he finally gets to the platform .
je : which makes every impulse going through the brain a binary code .
the one with the yellow-green suit , he 's flying head-down .
in 2008 i jumped the eiffel tower in paris .
because it looks like it might .
are you in a helmet ? are you in goggles ?
twenty-two people are graduating , and all 22 are going to college .
" yes , general . yes , general . "
" no excuse , sir . " " attaboy , you 're learning fast . "
that 's when love begins . that 's when structure begins .
i was a public school kid in new york city , and i didn 't do well at all .
give him to the army . we 'll never see him again . we 'll never see him again . "
i , so help me god , i grew up walking those streets , and they were always there .
it 's a country of such contrasts , but it 's a nation of nations .
you 're , well , you 're general powell . "
and i 'd be , like , " this is my job . "
and that night , her whole family took the couches and she slept together with her mom so that we could take their beds .
and meanwhile , my band is becoming bigger and bigger .
and you can see how many people it is .
should i ? show me .
and these are examples of the kinds of programs u.s. intelligence agencies are running right now , against the whole rest of the world .
in fact , 96 percent of the planet are foreigners .
even if they take every single computer on the planet just to decrypt that one file , it 's going to take millions of years .
instead , they 've been hacked .
all right , how many swedish decisionmakers and politicians and business leaders use , every day , u.s.-based services , like , you know , run windows or osx , or use facebook or linkedin , or store their data in clouds like icloud or skydrive or dropbox , or maybe use online services like amazon web services or sales support ?
are the americans ready to throw away the constituion and throw it in the trash just because there are terrorists ?
you show me your search history , and i 'll find something incriminating or something embarrassing there in five minutes .
what 's going to change the situation for the rest of the world is to try to steer away from systems built in the united states .
i grew up out west in the sierra nevada mountains , like you see here , in the red rock canyon .
what 's that palm tree doing there ?
here is times square , the two streams that came together to make a wetland in times square , as it was at the end of the american revolution .
and the old fields , the successional fields that go .
or the bobcat , needing rabbits and beavers and den sites .
so then we took the muir webs and we took them back to the maps .
this is the view over times square , with the beaver pond there , looking out toward the east .
what if we imagined the upper east side with green roofs , and streams winding through the city , and windmills supplying the power we need ?
one person 's not that unusual .
thank you .
this was completely unauthorized .
so again , this is 2005 .
that 's a cop wearing black right there , being filmed with a hidden camera .
he gave 2,000 high fives that day , and he washed his hands before and afterward and did not get sick .
in my previous life , i was an artist .
the pride of people about their own place of living , and there were feelings that had been buried deep for years under the fury of the illegal , barbaric constructions that sprang up in the public space .
and this was not a misplaced feeling .
we removed the kiosks .
when people say nothing can change , just stop and think what the world was like 10 , 20 , 50 , 100 years ago .
this is a new work , it 's a new program .
but here it is unwritten by law .
it can envy many municipalities , the color , the taste , the purity of this water .
this town was established 800 years ago .
this was for mass communication .
and where we have this gypsum strip they can harvest this water .
three sides , such steps , on the fourth side there is a four-story building where you can organize such ted conferences anytime .
these are the trees .
i sell a product to a market that doesn 't want it , but is forced by law to buy it .
this is really destructive .
so i can diagnose the problem a little more specifically in math .
but if you need to , your students can then develop those substeps together .
how long will it take it to fill it up ?
we 're no longer intimidated by math , because we 're slowly redefining what math is .
and she said , " oh no ! just dis everybody , except ralph nader . "
they say , " you know , the state , it 's necessary to fix these little market failures when you have public goods or different types of negative externalities like pollution , but you know what , what is the next big revolution going to be after the internet ?
now , you might be thinking , " well , she 's just said the word ' defense ' and ' military ' an awful lot , " but what 's really interesting is that this is actually true in sector after sector and department after department .
the private sector does a lot .
and the v.c. guys know this , and they 're able to actually fund the other losses from that one success .
it could happen perhaps through equity .
for example , i took a whole bunch of fortune cookies back to china , gave them to chinese to see how they would react .
so , the interesting question is , how do you go from fortune cookies being something that is japanese to being something that is chinese ?
believe it or not , these guys were actually crossing the road .
let 's go back to mid-1800s when the chinese first came to america .
so the thing is , this kind of idea of chinese-american food doesn 't exist only in america .
they actually did so through a centralized headquarters out of illinois , right ?
but at some point , all these people had a very similar experience that converged at a fortune cookie and at a chinese restaurant , and all these chinese restaurants were serving fortune cookies , which , of course we know aren 't even chinese to begin with .
so . thank you very much .
bioenergy isn 't global warming . bioenergy is something which seems counterintuitive . bioenergy is oil . it 's gas . it 's coal . and part of building that bridge to the future , to the point where we can actually see the oceans in a rational way , or put up these geo-spatial orbits that will twirl or do microwaves or stuff , is going to depend on how we understand bioenergy and manage it . and to do that , you really have to look first at agriculture .
this is how you farm oil . and as you think of farming oil and how oil has evolved , we started with this brute force approach . and then what did we learn ? then we learned we had to go bigger . and then what 'd we learn ? then we have to go even bigger . and we are getting really destructive as we 're going out and farming this bioenergy .
and as you think about this stuff and what the implications of this are , we 're going to start not just converting ethanol from corn with very high subsidies . we 're going to start thinking about biology entering energy . it is very expensive to process this stuff , both in economic terms and in energy terms .
but as far as we know , we 're the only upright-walking ape that exists on planet earth today , except for the bonobos .
and these things are so exciting . they are so often the only , or the very first time that anybody has ever seen the remains .
you can see some of the major fossil sites that we 've been working in the north . but , essentially , two million years ago , homo erectus , up in the far right corner , lived alongside three other species of human ancestor .
it 's actually this little piece up here on the top .
is this a good evolutionary adaptation , or is it going to lead us to being the shortest-lived hominid species on planet earth ?
we have a common past and we share a common future .
and they would be somethings like saws , knives , sickles and axes that i covered up with a piece of towel .
this is a picture of korean traditional bows taken from a museum , and see how my bow resembles them .
now , have any of y 'all ever looked up this word ?
and for another , deciding what words are good and what words are bad is actually not very easy .
the thing about computers is , i love computers .
and in fact , online dictionaries replicate almost all the problems of print , except for searchability .
so , if you have a ham butt problem , and you 're thinking about the ham butt problem , the conclusion that it leads you to is inexorable and counterintuitive : paper is the enemy of words .
they 're just the right tools for the job .
there 's a lot going on there .
so again , lexicography is not rocket science .
so there are a lot of really good word-collecting sites out there right now , but the problem with some of them is that they 're not scientific enough .
you see , what i 'm really hoping for is that my son , who turns seven this month -- i want him to barely remember that this is the form factor that dictionaries used to come in .
and so what if you could grow a battery in a petri dish ?
now if you look at biology , there 's many structures like dna and antibodies and proteins and ribosomes that you 've heard about that are already nano-structured .
and i know it says mit , and this is caltech , but i have a couple extra if people want it .
now if you take all billion viruses , and you can put them in one drop of liquid , you can force them to interact with anything you want on the periodic table .
this is the example of photocatalytic splitting of water .
so , upon landing -- this was still at the old hong kong airport that 's kai tak , when it was smack in the middle of the city -- i thought , " if i see something good , i 'm going to have a great time here in my two weeks . and if i see something negative , i 'm going to be miserable , indeed . "
and the police 's " synchronicity " cassette had just been released and there was no helmet law in my hometown of bregenz .
then , under " desire , " they showed these shunsho paintings -- also from the edo period -- ink on silk .
now , the way this works in the system is that nobody ever looks at these signs .
and he goes around new york and just puts them , empty as they are , on posters .
so it was : " everything i do always comes back to me . "
i first met him through the archon x prize for genomics .
and if it went really well , we might do three parabolas .
and we did a fourth , and a fifth and a sixth .
which leaves the question , what are the big causes of happiness ?
in other words , maybe the pleasures of the mind allow us to increase our happiness with mind-wandering .
we 're lucky in this data we have many responses from each person , and so we can look and see , does mind-wandering tend to precede unhappiness , or does unhappiness tend to precede mind-wandering , to get some insight into the causal direction .
we all saw the tragedy that happened in boston .
a doctor comes in from a block away , stop us , checks the kid , and tells us to stop cpr .
and we did turns , who 's going to listen to the radio scanners .
we 're not there to replace ambulances .
we started hand in hand saving jews and arabs .
it 's very easy to adopt .
the problem is , there aren 't enough eye care professionals in the world to use the model of the delivery of corrective eyewear that we have in the developed world .
in fact , this technology 's been evolving .
if you want to know more , just come have a look at our website . thank you .
why ?
for the last 8 years , i have dedicated my life to documenting the work of israelis and palestinians who are trying to end the conflict using peaceful means .
we saw the men trying to push the soldiers , but none of them could do that .
the residents , after 10 months of peaceful resistance , convinced the israeli government to move the route of the barrier off their lands and to the green line , which is the internationally recognized boundary between israel and the palestinian territories .
so they kept on going .
and the reason is that until wonder came along and figured out how to spread the idea of sliced bread , no one wanted it .
and the thing that 's happened is , they canceled the tv-industrial complex .
the world revolves around me . me , me , me , me , me . my favorite person -- me .
but the reason it 's number one is because that 's the week it came out .
what marketers used to do is make average products for average people .
krispy kreme has figured this whole thing out .
they got this way by being remarkable , sometimes a little too remarkable .
very good is boring . very good is average .
but they do have a lake .
this is a liter of oil .
no . but the thinking that we have to come up with has to be based on a realistic assessment of where we are .
and what are the stories that we tell ourselves now , as we look forward about where we 're going to go .
it 's open source . it 's something which everybody who 's involved with it develops and passes on as they work with it .
this is at a time when the city of bristol , which is quite close to here , was surrounded by commercial market gardens , which provided a significant amount of the food that was consumed in the town , and created a lot of employment for people , as well .
a lot of places now are starting to set up their own energy companies , community-owned energy companies , where the community can invest money into itself , to start putting in place the kind of renewable energy infrastructure that we need .
in scotland , the scottish government 's climate change fund has funded transition scotland as a national organization supporting the spread of this .
well , one or two brave souls .
so his choice was either to accept that dirty needle or not to get high .
so , in indonesia at this time , if you were carrying a needle and the cops rounded you up , they could put you into jail .
but in this country , where the government apparently does not feel compelled to provide health care for citizens , we 've taken a very different approach .
now , this makes people crazy because it means that you have to talk about some groups having more sexual partners in shorter spaces of time than other groups , and that 's considered stigmatizing .
so in the face of that , you really need quite a strong incentive to use condoms .
and the other thing is that people are simply not as scared of hiv as they were of aids , and rightly so .
ines is a a transgender hooker on the streets of jakarta ; she 's a chick with a dick .
we 're not all of them , of course , but ted is a community of opinion leaders .
and that rate has been escalating at the same rate as children not walking to school anymore , again , because of our development patterns .
so as a result of that , demographers predict that through 2025 , 75 to 85 percent of new households will not have kids in them .
this was a little grocery store , a food lion grocery store , that is now a public library .
when metrorail expanded transit into the suburbs and opened a station nearby to this site , the owners decided to build a new parking deck and then insert on top of their surface lots a new main street , several apartments and condo buildings , while keeping the existing office buildings .
they 're easy to be re-adapted .
so there 's a lot of great things , but i 'd love to see more corridors getting retrofitting .
and where should we be encouraging re-inhabitation ?
but we 've got to get the architecture better .
of these , two-thirds , 22 million are living in sub-saharan africa .
what does that mean ?
and so we need to find better ways of providing care .
take the same mother , and the nurse , after she gives her her test , takes her to a room .
so the mothers who work for us , they come from the communities in which they work .
the father and the mother , together , they get the results .
and then her oldest brother stood up and said , " i too have something to tell you .
and the issue in africa is that there are fewer nurses , really than doctors , and so we need to find new paradigm for health care .
and so in redefining the health care teams by bringing the mentor mothers in , we can do that .
the job of uncovering the global food waste scandal started for me when i was 15 years old .
there will always be waste . i 'm not that unrealistic that i think we can live in a waste-free world .
so i want you to imagine that these nine biscuits that i found in the bin represent the global food supply , okay ? we start out with nine .
i certainly haven 't .
he pointed at three grains of rice at the bottom of my bowl , and he said , " clean . "
at the same time we throw away millions of tons of food waste which we could and should be feeding them .
my task was , at least once a week , to visit mother lassiter who lived on east street , mother williamson who lived on bledsoe avenue , and mother lathers who lived on oberlin road .
this is our time . this is intimate time .
just a photograph .
we are so connected that we must treat each other as if an action toward you is an action toward myself .
and whatever else is needed , i will provide it and pay for it when i return . "
now , let me close my comments by telling you that whenever i feel something very deeply , it usually takes the form of verse .
i mean , look , it doesn 't take a double-blind , placebo-controlled study to figure out what makes a marriage not work .
for example , the happy wife .
do not win an oscar for best actress .
we 're healthier , physically and emotionally .
i understand we have over 80 countries here , so that 's a whole new paradigm for me to speak to all of these countries .
i 've turned the computer on , and these assistants are placing a giant floppy disk built out of cardboard , and it 's put into the computer .
you see this little pattern here ?
it 's just amazing , fear . but that 's form , content .
so i made this as a kind of an experiment at the time .
i don 't get it at all . " that means art is working , you know ?
a combination of the cloud and the dirt is where the action is at .
and this frame is important today , in this complex , ambiguous space , and artists and designers have a lot to teach us , i believe .
what is the tenor of their email ? how is it working out ?
it 's not necessary for understanding the importance of what i 'm going to say .
and now of the zetas and the traffickers and the criminals and the kidnappers ...
but , fear is better than apathy because fear makes us do something .
this shows that society is desperate and it 's taking the law into its own hands .
but julián le barón keeps working and he has been mobilizing communities in chihuahua for over a year .
our mother , mexico , is being violated before our very eyes .
are you awake ?
i 'm denied the right to speak my own language in my own country ?
mastery of the mother tongue is a prerequisite for creative expression in other languages .
they 'd go back to being consumers , clueless consumers , like we are most of the time .
he was puzzled by the thought : " how could anyone be this cruel ?
after that , we launched another campaign with scenes of letters on the ground .
let 's write a novel or produce a short film .
and in the supermarket , i promise my daughter noor , that if she says to me , " thanks , " i won 't say , " dis , ' merci , maman , ' " and hope no one has heard her .
snares on , snares off .
if i just simply let go and allow my hand , my arm , to be more of a support system , suddenly i have more dynamic with less effort . much more .
the room we happen to be in , the amplification , the quality of the instrument , the type of sticks ... etc . , etc .
so he would have a fullness of sound that those of you in the front few rows wouldn 't experience , those of you in the back few rows wouldn 't experience either .
and so therefore , acousticians are actually in conversation with people who are hearing impaired , and who are participators of sound .
now , i don 't mean just the sound ; i mean really listen to that thunder within yourselves .
please keep your back straight , etc . , etc . , etc . " -- where i was probably just going to end up absolutely rigid , frozen , and i would not be able to strike the drum , because i was thinking of so many other things -- he said , " evelyn , take this drum away for seven days , and i 'll see you next week . "
is it just literally for control , for hand-stick control ? why am i doing that ?
we 'll be showing the video at the end , but before we do , i want to talk a little bit about what it is that they wanted .
they wanted us to make use of the space .
we went to home depot well over a hundred times .
so also , put reliable stuff last , the stuff that 's going to run every time .
let me start again .
i was fortunate to join nasa and successfully propose an experiment to fly to venus .
i had the privilege to speak twice to the president 's climate task force .
now finally , we can measure earth 's energy imbalance precisely by measuring the heat content in earth 's heat reservoirs .
climate change deniers like to use this fact to confuse and trick the public by saying , " look , the temperature causes co2 to change , not vice versa . "
i think it will be more if we keep burning fossil fuels , perhaps even five meters , which is 18 feet , this century or shortly thereafter .
most people would get more in the monthly dividend than they 'd pay in increased prices .
clearly , i haven 't gotten this message across .
what were scientists called before ?
the problem was that an influential group at oxford began arguing that because it worked so well in economics , this deductive method ought to be applied to the natural sciences too .
this is the one now at the computer history museum in california , and it calculates accurately . it actually works .
there 's a flip side as well .
2.5 billion people worldwide have no adequate toilet .
diarrhea is the second biggest killer of children worldwide , and you 've probably been asked to care about things like hiv / aids or t.b. or measles , but diarrhea kills more children than all those three things put together .
think about it . that little boy who 's running back into his house , he may have a nice , clean fresh water supply , but he 's got dirty hands that he 's going to contaminate his water supply with .
there is now a new career path called stool donor .
i met her last october in india , and she grew up in a conservative environment .
so this woman , this boy 's mother installed this latrine in a few hours .
i 'm going to make your lives easy this afternoon and just ask you to do one thing , and that 's to go out , protest , speak about the unspeakable , and talk shit .
the building on the right at the top is now under construction .
and they started to have a life of their own and got bigger -- as the one glass at the walker .
but a friend of mine spent four hours wandering around here looking for this restaurant .
and so i set up this interior for jay 's offices and i made a pedestal for a sculpture .
i do it because it 's a curious thing in the culture , when things are made in such great quantities , absorbed in such great quantities , and there 's so much denial about them .
it made my building look sick .
it 's copper and galvanize .
and so then he put two bridges -- this all happened on the fax , going back and forth over a couple of weeks ' period .
in the curved part there 's all the mechanical equipment .
is it going to look like this beautiful estate is sub-divided ?
and this is our building , which is a corporate headquarters for an insurance company .
when you sleep in this bedroom , i hope -- i mean , i haven 't slept in it yet .
the material is lead copper , like in the building in boston .
this is in paris , along the seine .
and it faces into a park .
this is a shopping thing .
so it 's pretty quiet inside .
our client doesn 't want balconies , so -- and when we met our new acoustician , he told us this was the right shape or this was the right shape .
larry halprin is doing the stairs .
thank you very much .
before , they were closed off .
sometimes school is under a tree , or in many cases , the teacher has only a fifth-grade education , so you need a collaborative model of learning , not just building more schools and training more teachers , which you have to do anyway .
no big surprise , obama couldn 't do better than kerry there .
they asked this question .
which of these seem to drive this manifestation of racism in this big national experiment we had on november 4th ?
this was eight years ago , some people were more republican back then .
so we can think more about things like street grids .
this brief list includes human beings , natural landforms , works of art and skilled human actions .
i mean fossils , cave paintings and so forth .
i mean , you can 't expect to eat an adaptively beneficial landscape .
but the most intriguing prehistoric artifacts are older even than this .
stretching over a million years , the hand axe tradition is the longest artistic tradition in human and proto-human history .
there are two elections every election cycle in lesterland .
but you must do extremely well .
there are rich lesters , poor lesters , black lesters , white lesters , not many women lesters , but put that to the side for one second .
so the right wants smaller government .
these are the manageable problems , so you ignore — — so you ignore this corruption .
members and staffers and bureaucrats have an increasingly common business model in their head , a business model focused on their life after government , their life as lobbyists .
there 's nothing we can do . "
a government dependent upon the people alone .
each one is like a sun with a retinue of planets orbiting around it .
we know our universes are united though -- links between left and right .
and the most complex things are ourselves , midway between atoms and stars .
bio- and cybertechnologies are environmentally benign in that they offer marvelous prospects , while , nonetheless , reducing pressure on energy and resources .
and he sets an example of the concerned scientist .
what would they have seen ?
or will the biosphere stabilize ?
and it 's looking around , and when it finds something , and recognizes it being foreign , it will actually engulf it and eat it .
so that 's thousands of little grains of pollen there , and there 's the pistil there , and these are the little things called trichomes . and that 's what makes the flower give a fragrance , and plants actually communicate with one another through their fragrances .
so mountains are built up , and they erode away by water and rain and ice and so forth , and they become grains of sand .
now , the moon has no atmosphere , so micrometeorites come in continuously , and the whole surface of the moon is covered with powder now , because for four billion years it 's been bombarded by micrometeorites , and when micrometeorites come in at about 20 to 60,000 miles an hour , they vaporize on contact .
since my my first dive in a deep-diving submersible , when i went down and turned out the lights and saw the fireworks displays , i 've been a bioluminescence junky .
the flash is like a scream for help .
i just barely got the lights out in time for you to be able to see those gobs of light hitting the transect screen and then just glowing .
there are starfish that can make light .
and we view it with a camera system i developed called eye-in-the-sea that uses far red light that 's invisible to most animals , so it 's unobtrusive .
this is going to be a glowing source first , which is like bioluminescent bacteria .
and then he goes away for a few seconds to think about it some more , and thinks , " maybe if i come in from a different angle . "
if we just look at the single , biggest cause of death -- aging -- it accounts for roughly two-thirds of all human people who die .
so that 's the first big problem .
then , even a one percentage point reduction in the extinction risk could be equivalent to this astronomical number -- 10 to the power of 32 .
suppose we fixed these things -- we did something about all of these .
we have skin enhancements , clothing .
now , the human mind is not a single unitary information processor , but it has a lot of different , special , evolved modules that do specific things for us .
it 's been done in voles .
and the students wanted to speak to the government , and police answered with bullets .
road design makes a difference , particularly intersections , of which there are two types : signalized and unsignalized , which means stop signs .
that 's five cents each , and times 3,000 cars per day , that 's $ 51,000 per year .
so , it 's hard to create a new meaning for the existing sign .
there 's not a country in the world that now is not asking whether we can afford what doctors do .
if you had a prescription pad , if you had a nurse , if you had a hospital that would give you a place to convalesce , maybe some basic tools , you really could do it all .
we 're all specialists now , even the primary care physicians .
that would be really our only choice .
and he wanted to get the data .
and what they taught us was that designing a checklist to help people handle complexity actually involves more difficulty than i had understood .
there 's a deep resistance because using these tools forces us to confront that we 're not a system , forces us to behave with a different set of values .
so this is a computer program .
there 's the solar panels of the cell , some switches that turn your genes on and off , the girders of the cell , motors that move your muscles .
this is exactly analogous to the question , what 's the smallest program i can write that will act exactly like microsoft word ?
so , you can go to a natural source .
so i had the computer program design the short staples to do this .
so , you can put circuit components on the staples , like a light bulb and a light switch .
it was started by erik winfree , and what it does , it has tiles that are a hundredth the size of a dna origami .
so , what we 've done is we 've succeeded in making something much bigger than a dna origami by combining dna origami with tiles .
here is a dna origami rectangle , and here are some tiles growing from it .
my older sister was busy torturing my parents , and they were busy torturing her .
and so some of the things -- i mean , it was a long history of m & amp ; co , and clearly we also needed to make some money , so we decided we would create a series of products .
so , you know , and i have lots of wonderful-looking friends .
and from , you know , fattushis , to taxistan to , you know , for the fashtoonks , botoxia , pashmina , khlintunisia , you know , we were able to take the city and make fun of this completely foreign , who are -- what 's going on over here ?
and " would " is coco chanel 's lover , " should " is edith sitwell , and " could " is an august sander subject .
and then he breathed his last , with loved ones around him , and i know that he had chicken soup also , as his last meal . "
so , it 's a miracle that i 'm here today .
a quote by bertrand russell , " all the labor of all the ages , all the devotion , all the inspiration , all the noonday brightness of human genius are destined to extinction .
and i would like to run it for them .
so , how big ?
there are many basic properties about this plasma that still confuse us , still puzzle us , and still push our understanding of the physics of the very hot .
certainly what i 've said so far is crazy .
he had this to say : " if i had asked people what they wanted , they would have said faster horses . "
so i said , all right , let 's get out some supplies right now .
and so , of course , i decided to create an art installation called the dna vending machine .
we bled , we died , and we killed to stop that organization from the violence that they were putting largely against the iraqi people .
and he said , " well , you found them . " our command .
he also took a lot of documents that he didn 't have the knowledge to know the importance of , so i think we need to learn the facts about this case before we make snap judgments about edward snowden .
you 'd kind of depend on people to do that , and that was the building block .
so if somebody really wanted to attack the united states or western civilization these days , they 're not going to do it with tanks .
one of the reasons is a lot of their telephones use ip protocol and use things like skype and so on that go through the internet right now , and so in fact we 're becoming dependent on it for more and more different things , like when you take off from lax , you 're really not thinking you 're using the internet .
so what we need is something that doesn 't necessarily have to have the performance of the internet , but the police department has to be able to call up the fire department even without the internet , or the hospitals have to order fuel oil .
eighty-two dollars a night .
one of them has to do with inequality .
let 's see by a show of hands .
hm : to be frank , i just think this is , not to offend anyone , a very american way .
in fact , during the past three decades , when market reasoning and market thinking have gathered force and gained prestige , our public discourse during this time has become hollowed out , empty of larger moral meaning .
now , of course , not all deception hits the news .
let me tell you a little bit about a couple of new deceptions we 've been tracking and documenting .
here 's r.j. ellory , best-seller author in britain .
here 's a couple of studies . one of the studies we do are called diary studies , in which we ask people to record all of their conversations and all of their lies for seven days , and what we can do then is calculate how many lies took place per conversation within a medium , and the finding that we get that surprises people the most is that email is the most honest of those three media .
along the bottom is how tall they said they were in their profile .
and you 're not alone . around the world , almost every culture , one of the top cues is eyes . but the research over the last 50 years says there 's actually no reliable cue to deception , which blew me away , and it 's one of the hard lessons that i learned when i was customs officer .
what does that mean ? what 's the next big idea from that ?
well , what i can do now with my colleagues in computer science is we can create computer algorithms that can analyze the linguistic traces of deception .
but when it comes to lying and what we want to do with our lives , i think we can go back to diogenes and confucius . and they were less concerned about whether to lie or not to lie , and more concerned about being true to the self , and i think this is really important .
at bcg , we looked at this , and we asked ourselves , this can 't be the right way of managing healthcare .
nobody knows .
so the physicians get together , they agree on what quality is , they start measuring , they share the data , they find who 's best , and they learn from it .
physicians are , like most of you in the audience , very competitive .
next year , we 're planning to do eight diseases , the year after , 16 .
and one of the first victims of difficult economic times , i think , is public spending of any kind , but certainly in the firing line at the moment is public spending for science , and particularly curiosity-led science and exploration .
so it isn 't in the series .
and so this , again , a real picture of the ice fountains rising up into space , absolutely beautiful .
the reason many people think that about this picture , and al gore has said it many times , actually , on the stage at ted , is that this picture , arguably , was the beginning of the environmental movement .
i just wanted to show this picture because this is remarkable .
this is the picture of a galaxy , a common " our garden " galaxy with , what , 100 billion stars like our sun in it .
now , the explorers of the world of the atom did not intend to invent the transistor .
but it visited jupiter , saturn , uranus and neptune .
let me leave the last words to someone who 's rapidly becoming a hero of mine , humphrey davy , who did his science at the turn of the 19th century .
but in all cases , the water that 's released is perfectly adequate for growing microalgae .
and finally , we wanted to see where we could look at what the impact of this structure would be in the marine environment , and we set up a field site at a place called moss landing marine lab in monterey bay , where we worked in a harbor to see what impact this would have on marine organisms .
we did engineering to understand what we would need to be able to do to build this structure , not only on the small scale , but how we would build it on this enormous scale that will ultimately be required .
where else could we potentially put this system ?
jt : thank you .
so you could tune into poetry as you were flying .
and it uses the imagery of dollhouse furniture .
he lived , and still does , in rural vermont .
narration : " the dead . "
for some reason i keep remembering that lady jane grey was queen of england when she was only 15 .
so in this ambition to capture songs from the universe , we turn our focus to black holes and the promise they have , because black holes can bang on space-time like mallets on a drum and have a very characteristic song , which i 'd like to play for you -- some of our predictions for what that song will be like .
i like to imagine schwarzschild in the war in the trenches calculating ballistic trajectories for cannon fire , and then , in between , calculating einstein 's equations -- as you do in the trenches .
it might spill off into the hudson a little bit before it destroyed the earth .
now we 've never seen a shadow like this of a black hole , but black holes can be heard , even if they 're not seen .
imagine a lighter black hole falling into a very heavy black hole .
now that chirp is very characteristic of black holes merging -- that it chirps up at the end .
it might make a sound .
and if we pick it up , it will be music to our ears because it will be the quiet echo of that moment of our creation , of our observable universe .
ur : i 'd never learned it before , but he told me that we would be playing that on stage , so i was familiar with it , so that 's why i had so much more fun learning it .
but the more i wrote , and the more i practiced , the more i wanted to perform .
it was so bad .
except for when i was really nervous , like now .
what about athens ? mediterranean climate , but in the sun it was not comfortable . they didn 't perceive comfort .
so we need to do something active .
and i can do that in the first year and i can balance that in the next 10 , and the next 20 years , this energy , which is necessary to condition a world cup in qatar , the next 20 years , this energy goes into the grid of qatar .
and our friend , betty edwards , the " drawing on the right side of the brain " lady , shows these two tables to her drawing class and says , " the problem you have with learning to draw is not that you can 't move your hand , but that the way your brain perceives images is faulty .
and yet , it is not taught in any k through 12 curriculum in america that i 'm aware of .
and bingo . that is all you have to do .
and the mathematicians and scientists in the crowd will recognize these two progressions as a first-order discrete differential equation and a second-order discrete differential equation , derived by six-year-olds .
and it 's interesting .
teacher : drop . class : whoa !
yeah , there we go . yeah , ok ?
so i have had the good fortune for the past 20 years to study these fascinating and beautiful mammals .
however , there are a group that do not use echolocation .
without them , it 's going to be a problem .
again , what does it mean here ? what does this variation actually mean ? so if we are to capitalize on all of this new molecular data and personalized genomic information that is coming online that we will be able to have in the next few years , we have to be able to differentiate between the two . so how do we do this ?
so why should we be interested in aging at all ?
and hopefully in the next five years , i 'll be giving you a tedtalk on that .
their name in your inbox -- it 's all you wanted anyway .
it is not a question of if you can -- it 's : do ya ?
and you know why i understand that ?
i started off in scranton , pennsylvania .
no doctor , can i remember , ever asking me , " where have you lived ? "
if you really studied that you might have some clues as to what paul likes to do .
but it will also be useful for us .
and i want to talk today about one of the things that we decided to do , which was to think about a new way of approaching healthcare .
and here he is , paralyzed completely , unable to breathe and move , over this time journey .
look at this hiv patient down here , zinny .
all open , all available .
i don 't want to just look at this cool device , i want to take this data and make something even better .
you 've seen multiple of these today , when everyone 's bragging about the amazing things they 've done .
and we went around and we talked to people , and they said , " you can 't run a clinical trial like this . you know ?
so , we couldn 't run a clinical trial , we couldn 't figure it out .
i never really knew whether it worked .
and her husband had come in and entered her last functional scores , because he knew how much she cared .
we 'll do some side-by-side comparisons here .
now , american copyright and patent laws run counter to this notion that we build on the work of others .
so it 's not multi-touch as a whole that 's patented .
we have no such aversion towards copying what other people have , because we do that nonstop .
my heart rate was 61 beats per minute -- my blood pressure , 127 over 74 .
it 's really just a pressure sensor like the kind that 's in a doorbell .
and the self isn 't the only thing ; it 's not even most things .
i started when i was 15 years old .
a large wave of riots had broken into the first projects of paris .
a year later , i was listening to all the noise about the middle east conflict .
and so palestinians guys say , " calm down . no wait . i 'm going to find you a solution . "
but exactly four years after , the photos , most of them are still there .
i heard it was one of the most violent favelas , because the largest drug cartel controls it .
you see that enough in the media .
they kept asking me , " what is the purpose of your project ?
you know what i love is , for example , when you see the biggest eye there , there are so [ many ] houses inside .
so we didn 't get caught this time .
and that is for me one of the more important things in the work .
i use man ray , helen levitt , giacomelli , other people 's artwork .
so a subject you 're passionate about , a person who you want to tell their story or even your own photos -- tell me what you stand for .
we need to maintain an optimum temperature for the growth .
and then you can either cut that out and sew it conventionally , or you can use the wet material to form it around a three-dimensional shape .
but with synthetic biology , we can actually imagine engineering this bacterium to produce something that gives us the quality , quantity and shape of material that we desire .
it 's a simple idea about nature .
because , of course , the bee thinks he 's in charge or she 's in charge , but we know better .
that a certain kind of potato , a certain kind of drug , a sativa-indica cannabis cross has something to say about us .
i 'll give you two examples , also from the garden : lima beans . you know what a lima bean does when it 's attacked by spider mites ?
this is a farm in the shenandoah valley of virginia .
but he waits that long to grow them as big and juicy and tasty as he can because they are the chickens ' favorite form of protein .
this is how soil is created .
the first number is three : three billion people .
other companies have sustainability strategies .
they were mis-sold for more than a hundred years .
cotton 's brilliant . probably many people are wearing cotton right now .
that 's about the size of germany .
many businesses now , fortunately , have codes of conduct and audit their supply chains , but not every business . far from it .
so we 've launched a women 's open network this week in ikea , and we 'll do whatever it takes to lead the change .
when i was in elementary school , my next door neighbor , he gave me a book for my birthday .
it 's actually pretty busy .
it 's actually running at real rate right now , one second per second , and in fact , voyager 1 here is flying by titan at i think it 's 38,000 miles per hour .
you can manipulate it yourself .
i think we should say it all together .
what 's in that information ?
and still , you may not see the branches .
you guys are laughing , but you know , this book changed my life .
i feel curiosity , and i feel wonder , but at times i have also felt despair .
well , it 's true .
and as i told you just now , neural activity can change the connectome .
i hope not .
we know that damage to the brain occurs after death and during freezing .
so we saw this and we thought , can there be a better way ?
let 's look at each one of those technologies in a bit more detail .
and i want to show you what one of those vehicles looks like up close .
it can be used perhaps in other places in the world .
so for those that still believe that this is science fiction , i firmly say to you that it is not .
that when it comes to the rich , we 'll bail out and we 'll hand a lot of aid , but when it comes to our poor brethren , we want little to do with it .
i want to share one story about an innovation called drip irrigation .
and when he had a prototype and had a better understanding of how to market to farmers , that 's when patient capital could come in .
he recently authorized the creation of a social innovation fund to focus on what works in this country , and look at how we can scale it .
and we drove for eight hours along this moonscape-like landscape with very little color , lots of heat , very little discussion , because we were exhausted .
for that is what we 'll need , as we move forward to dream and imagine what it will really take to build a global economy that includes all of us , and to finally extend that fundamental proposition that all men are created equal to every human being on the planet .
at the end of my first year in school , in the summer of that year , i discovered a couple hummingbirds that were caught in a shed near my home .
another difference , and i have to describe this , because it 's very personal , another great difference between the helicopter and the volantor -- in my case the skycar volantor -- is the experience that i 've had in flying both of those .
and where is that going to lead you to ?
go to a local vertiport , plug in your destination , delivered almost like a passenger .
and the adage that i 'm referring to , that applied at that time , was that nothing comes down faster than a vtol aircraft upside down .
and then you have three -- you still have the triple redundancy .
twenty-three percent said , " as soon as it 's proven safe . "
i didn 't know that ; that 's pretty cool .
it mentioned leopards and ring-tailed coatis and poison dart frogs and boa constrictors and then coleoptera , which turn out to be beetles .
but as the article mentions , because of enzyme breakdown , it 's unlikely that phenethylamine will reach your brain if taken orally .
he doesn 't .
and for me , i quickly landed on this one : the earth has a tolerance of about .17 percent from the reference spheroid , which is less than the .22 percent allowed in billiard balls .
how have we not made the connection ?
the adoption process took , like , a matter of months , so it was a closed shop , you know , sealed deal , an industrious , utilitarian solution : the government , the farmer , the adopting parents , the consumer , the mother , the earth , and the child , the crop .
and then i was supposed to determine whether that was the voice of god or it was the voice of the devil .
it 's not that i 'd had the rug pulled from beneath me as much as the entire floor had been taken away .
it gives you reference points .
in fact there is little evidence that there is any cognitive ability in a very young infant .
and if you did he 'd probably be from sao paulo .
the sound doesn 't have to be valuable to the animal : i could raise the animal in something that could be hypothetically valuable , like the sounds that simulate the sounds of a native language of a child .
this is actually very powerful .
now this is a map , down in the surface of the brain , in which , in a very elaborate experiment we 've reconstructed the responses , location by location , in a highly detailed response mapping of the responses of its neurons .
this is constructed by physical change .
it 's constructed . it 's created in your brain .
we don 't hear about that anymore . where did it go ?
and you can look in the brain of such a child and record those time constants .
this is in a broad assessment of their language abilities .
these are 80- to 90-year-olds .
i 'm thrilled to be here .
so the insight is how do you actually reverse engineer this and go from cocoon to gland and get water and protein that is your starting material .
so as you see the film go in transparently through there , and then ...
and so you have here a little example of a small skull -- what we call mini yorick .
silk , during its self-assembly process , acts like a cocoon for biological matter .
now i eat whenever i 'm hungry , and i 've lost 10 pounds .
your brain works exactly the same way , responding to weight loss by using powerful tools to push your body back to what it considers normal .
let 's call them intuitive eaters and controlled eaters .
diets don 't have very much reliability .
why do we keep doing the same thing and expecting different results ?
this is what a five-meter rise in sea levels would look like .
all right , now what you might notice is that these two graphs are actually identical , not in terms of the x- and y-axes , or in terms of the data they present , but in terms of their moral and political implications , they say the same thing .
this is a reconstruction of ancient babylon , and this is tenochtitlan .
this was a golden age of bipartisanship , at least in terms of the parties ' ability to work together and solve grand national problems .
but when you look at cross-party ratings , you find , well , that it 's lower , but actually , when i first saw this data , i was surprised .
but the problem isn 't primarily that we 're electing bad people to congress .
sometimes a single threat can polarize us , as we saw .
as i know from working with street children in brazil , mom 's boyfriend is often a really , really dangerous person for kids .
please raise your hands .
let us therefore go to battle stations , not to fight each other , but to begin deflecting these incoming asteroids .
you don 't need to go to the chemist anymore .
so i first noticed this in a place i spend a lot of time -- my facebook page .
scott 's results were full of them .
what they discovered was that in our netflix queues there 's this epic struggle going on between our future aspirational selves and our more impulsive present selves .
and so now , we 're kind of back in 1915 on the web .
it helps him when he is overwhelmed with grief and despair .
he said , " well what are you doing ? "
some of it is like gangrenous , and there are maggots in the flesh . and it 's terrible .
and then , suddenly , there 's a pfft , a noise like that .
maitreya then took him to a certain heaven , which is the typical way a buddhist myth unfolds .
so , my mother in this life is really great . but all of you in a way are part of the eternal mother .
he has his little ears and he smiles and he rocks you in his arms .
and so you see beings in their potential happiness .
but actually they are cruel to themselves .
and that means whatever happens to other beings is happening to us : we are responsible for that , and we should take it and do whatever we can at whatever little level and small level that we can do it .
this was an issue from 2002 that they published with a lot of different articles on the bionic human .
one of the challenges is that the richer we are , the longer we live .
there are very few things , very few things that you can really do that will change the way that you can treat these kinds of diseases and experience what i would call healthy aging .
but what we 're talking about in regenerative medicine is doing this in every organ system of the body , for tissues and for organs themselves .
i 'm going to give you an example of three of these tools through which to converse with the body .
so i 'm going to put the slide up now . it won 't be up for long .
remember that i mentioned before the children who lose their fingertips .
and if you look really carefully , it 's going to be right around this point you 'll actually see a back-flush .
out comes the liposuction fluid , and in this case , the stem cells are isolated and turned into neurons .
it 's very powerful work .
myself and jay vacanti from harvard went to visit with him and a number of his directors of his institute just a few months ago , to try and convince him that it was time to take just a little piece of that 27.5 billion dollars that he 's going to get next year and focus it , in a strategic way , to make sure we can accelerate the pace at which these things get to patients .
also , those very sounds tend not to be represented by the characters that are available in european languages .
how did look at the stuff in your life ?
and the metals , we typically get from ore that we mine in ever widening mines and ever deepening mines around the world .
and any plastic can be any color , as you probably well know .
so about 20 years ago , i literally started in my garage tinkering around , trying to figure out how to separate these very similar materials from each other , and eventually enlisted a lot of my friends , in the mining world actually , and in the plastics world , and we started going around to mining laboratories around the world .
they get to close the loop with their products .
this is the same material that you would get from oil .
google mapmaker is a technology that empowers each of us to map what we know locally .
and it 's largely what you would find in these books .
and this magic view allows you to see all of what 's happening while the broccoli steams .
one of our philosophies in the book is that no dish is really intrinsically any better than any other dish .
and so it showed up , we used it a little while , we cut it in half .
we 've got lots of little tidbits in the book .
and it 's really simple , as you can see here .
the other amazing thing is , when this ballistics gelatin comes down , it falls back down as a nice block .
okay , part one starts back in 1929 when the great astronomer edwin hubble realized that the distant galaxies were all rushing away from us , establishing that space itself is stretching , it 's expanding .
but i promised you a mystery here in part one .
but there 's a cost to this elegant unification , because years of research have shown that the math of string theory doesn 't quite work .
maybe each of these shapes is on an equal footing with every other .
kepler was asking the wrong question .
the fuel is based on something called a quantum field , but the only detail that matters for us is that this fuel proves to be so efficient that it 's virtually impossible to use it all up , which means in the inflationary theory , the big bang giving rise to our universe is likely not a one-time event .
and they will conclude that the universe is static and unchanging and populated by a single central oasis of matter that they inhabit -- a picture of the cosmos that we definitively know to be wrong .
we can understand how to understand the data from the microwave background radiation that was set down 13.72 billion years ago -- and yet , we can do calculations today to predict how it will look and it matches .
and i think inspired by that memory , it 's been my desire to try and bring it to as many other people as i can , sort of pass it on through whatever means .
yet , of course , like all music , it 's essentially not about anything .
well notation not only passed the music on , notating and encoding the music changed its priorities entirely , because it enabled the musicians to imagine music on a much vaster scale .
the what now was not to mirror the mind of god , but to follow the emotion turbulence of man .
but whatever direction the music took , one thing until recently was always the same , and that was when the musicians stopped playing , the music stopped .
the question remains : what happens when the music stops ?
and it excites me now to meet people who are hikers , chefs , code writers , taxi drivers , people i never would have guessed who loved the music and who are passing it on .
maybe it would inform clinicians around the world on how to improve on the clinical management of hiv patients .
for example , it is counterintuitive to have an illiterate study participant , like celine , sign a lengthy consent form that they are unable to read , let alone understand .
if , for any reason , they feel that this might not be possible , then i think they should have to ethically justify why the clinical trial should be conducted in the first place .
tribal societies shouldn 't be scorned as primitive and miserable , but also they shouldn 't be romanticized as happy and peaceful .
one use of older people in traditional societies is that they often are still effective at producing food .
still a third reason is our american cult of youth , which shows up even in our advertisements .
today , though , those skills are utterly useless because any idiot can now multiply eight-digit numbers accurately and instantly with a pocket calculator .
younger people don 't .
they almost never die of diabetes , heart disease , stroke , and the other noncommunicable diseases that will be the causes of death of almost all of us in this room today .
the short answer is : they return to the environment in one way or another , continuing the cycle of toxicity .
just a little .
the decompiculture society shares a vision of a cultural shift , from our current culture of death denial and body preservation to one of decompiculture , a radical acceptance of death and decomposition .
forty years later , this group , more than most , are well aware of the destructive power that our species can wield over our environment .
she , better than most , knew the power of an image .
and thank you to all the photographers .
literature allowed him to transcend his surroundings .
he then ran twice for the senate , lost twice .
and he , pointing to the proclamation , said , " i believe , in this measure , my fondest hopes will be realized . "
so as for that second sphere , not of work , but of love -- encompassing family , friends and colleagues -- it , too , takes work and commitment .
so i think that part of his attraction for me was that i loved listening to his tall tales .
as his spirits sagged , his body deteriorated until , i believe , he slowly brought about his own death .
and so they said , " well , did you see george washington in there ? "
when you are brought up as a catholic , you think that if you ever set foot in a protestant church , you 'll be struck dead at the threshold .
" oh yes , " i said .
her name is pam moran in albemarle county , virginia , the foothills of the blue ridge mountains .
and so they pleaded with me to get a degree in something .
this film is called " world peace and other 4th grade achievements . "
i didn 't use that stare very often , but i do have it in my repertoire .
so i thought , well they like to play games .
there 's oil spills , environmental disasters , water rights disputes , breakaway republics , famine , endangered species and global warming .
and i admit the truth to them right up front : i don 't know .
we were all upset with her , " why are you doing this ?
you have to write a letter to their parents -- the fictional parents of your fictional troops -- explaining what happened and offering your condolences .
and so i 've been winning battles , so i 'm going into battles , more battles .
i should have gotten it so they could have won .
spontaneous compassion that could not be planned for , that was unexpected and unpredictable .
so , that 's what i want to talk about today .
and it 's -- in the most schematic possible view , it 's a coordination problem , right ?
right ? we 've created a professional class of photographers whose goal is to go out and photograph the mermaid parade , or whatever else they 're sent out to photograph .
it 's mathematically true , but it doesn 't really talk about anything important -- because in these systems , the average isn 't really what matters .
and that sounds strange to our ears , but what ends up happening is that 80 percent of the contributors have contributed a below-average amount .
when you 're dealing with the left-hand edge of one of these distributions , when you 're dealing with the people who spend a lot of time producing a lot of the material you want , that 's an institution-as-enabler world .
we hired this programmer , he came in , he drank our cokes and played foosball for three years and he had one idea .
and i use that word advisedly .
pro-ana , the pro-ana groups .
the printing press precipitated 200 years of chaos , moving from a world where the catholic church was the sort of organizing political force to the treaty of westphalia , when we finally knew what the new unit was : the nation state .
we have focused on the problems .
and so our national accounting system became fixated on what we can produce .
why don 't we create a measure of progress that shows that ?
to the top right of the graph , are countries which are doing reasonably well and producing well-being , but they 're using a lot of planet to get there .
what 's happening in costa rica ?
and the point really is , is that i think , probably everybody in this room would like society to get to 2050 without an apocalyptic something happening .
and this is where i think we can take a leaf out of systems theory , systems engineers , where they create feedback loops , put the right information at the right point of time .
and the first of these is to connect , is that your social relationships are the most important cornerstones of your life .
you tell one of them to spend it on themselves and one on other people .
if you 're living in iran , you 're facing censorship , harassment , arrest , torture -- at times , execution .
but also , i worry about the west , because often in this country , in this western world that we have , culture risks being a form of entertainment .
i am a nomadic artist .
being a visual artist , indeed , i am foremost interested to make art -- to make art that transcends politics , religion , the question of feminism , and become an important , timeless , universal work of art .
thank you so much .
and yet , even at this most fundamental level , context is everything .
identical in shape , size , spectral content .
there is no a priori reason why an " h " has to go between that " w " and " a. "
i take it from your response they don 't look the same anymore . right ?
if they are under the same light , reflecting the same amount of light to your eye , then they must be equally reflective .
keep blinking . every time you blink it will switch . alright ?
and they land on the flower . they stick their tongue in there , called a proboscis , and they drink sugar water .
well , one of the ways we do in my lab and studio is we translate the light into sound and we enable people to hear their visual world .
we are not defined by our central properties , by the bits that make us up .
the question is , " is that an illusion ? "
they do exist . here 's how they work .
but is there more that could be done for this corner of the labor market ?
so why do we have this disparity between these incredibly sophisticated markets at the top of the economy that are increasingly sucking more and more activity and resource out of the main economy into this rarefied level of trading , and what the rest of us have ?
let 's take britain as an example .
so , taxi journeys might be one example .
should they be moving to another part of the country where there 's a shortage of babysitters ?
so i said , " well , how many words do i get ? "
and now , when i tell people what i do , they move toward me .
and the third problem about the disease model is , in our rush to do something about people in trouble , in our rush to do something about repairing damage , it never occurred to us to develop interventions to make people happier , positive interventions .
they don 't spend time alone .
the first drawback is that it turns out the pleasant life , your experience of positive emotion , is heritable , about 50 percent heritable , and , in fact , not very modifiable .
he 's not consigned to the hell of unhappiness and that 's because len , like most of you , is enormously capable of flow .
you don 't look like debbie reynolds .
i hope all of you have such a person .
conversely , if you have none of the three , the empty life , the sum is less than the parts .
and if technology can , in the next decade or two , increase the pleasant life , the good life and the meaningful life , it will be good enough .
so what does that mean ?
it 'll dim .
i was to address a conference at a hotel .
we 've had others .
how do we solve it ?
the british philosopher bertrand russell was not a religious man , but he said , " it 's in our hearts that the evil lies , and it 's from our hearts that it must be plucked out . "
i find [ that ] young people all over the world are searching for something .
yes , to be sure , science has done much to push back certain types of human suffering .
many commentators have said that death is the forbidden subject of our generation .
i 've stood at the deathbed of several famous people , whom you would know .
i 've done a lot of speaking in germany and in france , and in different parts of the world -- 105 countries it 's been my privilege to speak in .
he experienced it in a way that went beyond scientific observation and reason .
i 'm the embodiment of all truth . "
well actually , i hope for a while longer yet .
but nevertheless , i was recruited by the british council , along with about 25 other teachers .
but indeed , that is exactly what we do .
we need more than that . where do we draw the line ?
they were doing an experiment to do with genetics and the forelimbs and the hind limbs of animals .
let us not keep them and ourselves in the dark .
so if we 're seriously talking about tackling climate change on an urbanizing planet , we need to look somewhere else for the solution .
now we may find that there are places that are really , really dense and still hold onto their cars , but the reality is that , by and large , what we see when we get a lot of people together with the right conditions is a threshold effect , where people simply stop driving as much , and increasingly , more and more people , if they 're surrounded by places that make them feel at home , give up their cars altogether .
okay . i do too .
we have visions like this . we have visions like this .
so i asked the girls , " how can we help other girls develop healthy relationships with their fathers ? "
so i asked , " what do you think we should do about this ?
so we needed to create something that they could take with them .
and below , you can see all these out yards , or temporary yards , where the colonies are brought in until february , and then they 're shipped out to the almonds .
if you don 't just want a queen , you can buy , actually , a three-pound package of bees , which comes in the mail , and of course , the postal office is always very concerned when they get , you know , your three-pound packages of bees .
and a lot of people talk about trucks and moving bees , and that being bad , but we 've done that for thousands of years .
but we estimate that about one in three bites of food we eat is directly or indirectly pollinated by honeybees .
and bumblebees are what we call eusocial : they 're not truly social , because only the queen is , over winter .
and i think if we reconnect to nature , we 'll be able to have the resources and that interest to solve these problems .
now , not all of us have meadows , or lawns that we can convert , and so you can always , of course , grow a meadow in a pot .
and that of all the technologies that were exploited to make that carnage come into being , probably the single group of technologies that cost the most lives were those that enable 50,000 people to live in two buildings 110 stories above the ground .
if they did , it probably was right there at ground zero .
it 's some guy , it 's a geocities homepage of some guy that i found online who 's interested , if you look at the bottom , in soccer and jesus and garth brooks and clint beckham and " my hometown " -- those are his links .
and so at any given time , on any given page on the web , actually , you can say , what does the weblog community think about this page ?
the columbia blows up , suddenly there are a lot of searches on columbia .
so gary bauer is not too far behind -- has slightly different theories about evolution and natural selection .
and i think what happens there will also happen in the wider system .
so the most amazing thing about this -- and i 'll end on this note -- is , most emergent systems , most self-organizing systems are not made up of component parts that are capable of looking at the overall pattern and changing their behavior based on whether they like the pattern or not .
to be a man means not to be a girl .
their stories were so horrific , and so mind-blowing and so on the other side of human existence , that to be perfectly honest with you , i was shattered .
on my way here on the airplane , i was walking up and down the aisle of the plane .
girls are trained to please .
there is a girl named dorcas , and i just met her in kenya .
when we were there she was doing a ritual where she reconciles girls , who have run away , with their families .
we will not cut you .
i am an emotional creature .
i know we have pushed the earth too far .
i love , i love , love , love being a girl !
i figured , surely some of the most creative artistic minds in the world , really , aren 't all defaulting back to this one easy trope like they invented it , right ?
on that very day , december 10 , 1996 while mr. four in the morning , faron young , was giving up the ghost in nashville , tennessee , ms. four in the morning -- or one of them anyway -- wislawa szymborska was in stockholm , sweden , accepting the nobel prize for literature .
parse it cover to cover for whatever hidden references you want .
the year , let 's remember , that this voice , now departed , first came a-cryin ' into this big old crazy world of ours .
here , we have all the binary arithmetic and logic that drove the computer revolution .
the guy who was supposed to build this machine was the guy in the middle , vladimir zworykin , from rca .
these were not theoretical physicists .
and that 's what i 've been doing , this last six months , is going through the logs .
" everything up to this point is wasted time . " " what 's the use ? good night . "
" only happens when the machine is running . "
when the bomb people went home , he was allowed in there .
and there 's really no difference between what he was doing in the computer and what nature did billions of years ago .
it 's a world that von neumann himself envisioned .
and so this is a philippe starck juicer , produced by alessi .
yeah ! yeah .
and if you look at the inside of the car -- i mean , i loved it , i wanted to see it , i rented it , this is me taking a picture while my son is driving -- and the inside of the car , the whole design is fun .
and she 'd bring them in , and she 'd say , " this is an iq test and it determines how well you do in life .
biology -- we have co-adapted through biology to like bright colors .
automatic behavior -- skilled behavior -- is subconscious , controlled by the behavioral side .
cognition is about understanding the world , emotion is about interpreting it -- saying good , bad , safe , dangerous , and getting us ready to act , which is why the muscles tense or relax .
this is a clear don norman watch .
and if you 've ever been in a meeting where you play sort of meeting " chicken , " you 're sitting there , looking at the person , waiting for them to look away , and then quickly checking the device .
this is the sound of one hand clapping .
it should be noted , of course , that the united states and the u.k. are the next in line .
why ? because i have to consider that and i have to modify what i 'm saying to say , " it will rain , " or " it 's going to rain . "
now this is a fanciful theory .
" excuse me , would you mind if i peruse your stock portfolio ?
yes , futureless language speakers , even after this level of control , are 30 percent more likely to report having saved in any given year .
so first of all , what is a tasmanian devil ?
and the next image i 'm going to show is quite gruesome .
cancer occurs when a single cell in your body acquires a set of random mutations in important genes that cause that cell to start to produce more and more and more copies of itself .
and when i looked at the sequence of the dna , and compared the sequence of jonas ' tumor to that of the rest of his body , i discovered that they had a completely different genetic profile .
he 's a dog that belongs to a family in mombasa in kenya .
but a small number of them did , and they were mostly people who were otherwise ill -- whose immune systems were probably compromised .
here 's a little picture of derek going up now , when you were with your nanny .
but after a while , i thought , well , the only way is to just pick you up , shove derek over to the other side of the room , and in the 10 seconds that i got before derek came back , i could just play something very quickly for him to learn .
and it 's that ability , that ability to hear simultaneous sounds , not only just single sounds , but when a whole orchestra is playing , derek , you can hear every note , and instantly , through all those hours and hours of practice , reproduce those on the keyboard , that makes you , i think , is the basis of all your ability .
in fact , the first time , derek , you played that with an orchestra , you 'd learned the version that you 'd learned , and then the orchestra , in fact , did have a different version , so while we were waiting in the two hours before the rehearsal and the concert , derek listened to the different version and learned it quickly and then was able to play it with the orchestra .
ao : i should really get derek 's manager to come and play it .
bottom line is , there is a lot of problems out there in the world .
but of course , there 's a problem in asking people to focus on problems .
but every organization would also hate to be not on the top of the list .
what should we do about it , and what will be the outcome ?
i 'm going to go from backwards so that we end up with the best projects .
we could give clean drinking water , sanitation , basic healthcare and education to every single human being on the planet .
again , the point is to say that we could actually pull two to three hundred million people out of poverty , very radically fast , in about two to five years .
well , of course , one of the things is climate change again .
of course , that 's mainly because climate change has good pictures .
you know , when you ask the world 's best economists , you inevitably end up asking old , white american men .
thank you .
our humming will be drumming .
you don 't need to say her name out loud , you can just hold her .
i think now i never was pure .
faced with absence .
and you realize that there is incredible power in the wind , and it can do amazing things .
wind is the second-largest renewable resource after solar : 3600 terawatts , more than enough to supply humanity 200 times over .
and the spruce goose would be a 15-megawatt wing .
" upwake " tells the story of zero , a modern-day business man , going to work with his life in a suitcase , stuck between dream and reality and not able to decipher the two .
i didn 't use it as a special effect , but as a partner on stage .
it 's as though the mystery of the person they 're interacting with and connecting allows them to be themselves just a bit more .
there is a revolution in the way that we think , in the way that we share , and the way that we express our stories , our evolution .
what we saw very quickly is the world of both medical research , but also developing drugs and treatments , is dominated by , as you would expect , large organizations , but in a new field , sometimes large organizations really have trouble getting out of their own way , and sometimes they can 't ask the right questions , and there is an enormous gap that 's just gotten larger between academic research on the one hand and pharmaceutical companies and biotechs that are responsible for delivering all of our drugs and many of our treatments , and so we knew that to really accelerate cures and therapies , we were going to have to address this with two things : new technologies and also a new research model .
you can 't imagine other businesses that you would think of going into that have these kind of numbers .
this is not scalable , and also when you do things by hand , even in the best laboratories , you have variations in techniques , and you need to know , if you 're making a drug , that the aspirin you 're going to take out of the bottle on monday is the same as the aspirin that 's going to come out of the bottle on wednesday .
buzzcar lets people rent out their own cars to their friends and neighbors .
this is all happening with excess capacity .
so i actually know a lot about building a peer platform now , and a peers , inc. company , because i 've spent the last two years doing that in paris .
and zipcar provides a very nice , consistent service that works fabulously .
all we have to do is create a fabulous platform for participation -- nontrivial .
so now , we are going to speak of happiness .
although we want to avoid suffering , it seems we are running somewhat towards it .
can we have this kind of well-being while being sad ? in a way , why not ?
and isn 't that stronger ?
so is that possible , to change our way of being , to transform one 's mind ?
benevolence , loving kindness against hatred .
now , recently , it has been found that it can change a lot .
it 's the opposite on the left side : more tendency to altruism , to happiness , to express , and curiosity and so forth .
we do all kinds of things to remain beautiful .
this fascination led me to submerge myself in art , study neuroscience and later to become a psychotherapist .
so when you think about it , we 're almost like a tourist visiting ourselves over there .
the shape on the right over here has become an indicator of what 's going on in my head .
so controlling stuff with your mind is pretty cool .
in the original zen bound game , you play it by scrolling your fingers over the pad .
this can be as effective as ritalin .
and with this , we can get the skinny on our psychological happenings and build a story of our behaviors over time .
but before i do that , let me tell you a couple of things that made this possible .
well , you can 't compare oranges to windshields .
you can cover up one of her eyes , and you can still read something in the other eye , and i see sort of curiosity in one eye , i see maybe a little bit of surprise in the other .
so a rational choice economist would say , well , you should take all non-zero offers .
so we realized we could exploit this , and in fact , as we 've done that , and we 've done this now in many thousands of people , i think on the order of five or six thousand . we actually , to make this a biological probe , need bigger numbers than that , remarkably so . but anyway , patterns have emerged , and we 've been able to take those patterns , convert them into mathematical models , and use those mathematical models to gain new insights into these exchanges . okay , so what ?
thanks for having me .
i wanted it all -- home office , sit down dinner for 10 , room for guests , and all my kite surfing gear .
why have a six burner stove when you rarely use three ?
what 's in yours ?
the exhibition was meant to be a way to have children think of doing ...
but design , for some reason , is still misunderstood for decoration .
and then , for instance , this other exhibition that was entitled workspheres in 2001 , where i asked different designers to come up with ideas for the new type of work styles that were happening in the world at that time .
it 's a long story because it started before 2001 and it was called emergency .
i was recently at a conference on luxury organized by the herald tribune in istanbul .
the rhythm of the sinusoids has changed tremendously , just like the rhythm of our life in the past 25 years , so i 'm not sure anymore what the wavelength is .
you see , i was a study nerd .
1858 was a year of great technological advancement in the west .
and on that axis i have life expectancy , the health of people .
and then after the first world war , they continue up .
and they were catching up indeed .
you see this enormous inequity in china , in the midst of fast economic growth .
we have an enormous disparity in the world .
so they doesn 't seem to go this way , these countries .
will the former rich countries really accept a completely changed world economy , and a shift of power away from where it has been the last 50 to 100 to 150 years , back to asia ?
nobody had had a glimpse of the brain 's wiring .
because if you can get the gene for green fluorescent protein and deliver it to a cell , that cell will glow green -- or any of the many variants now of green fluorescent protein , you get a cell to glow many different colors .
when we think of nepal , we tend to think of the snow-capped mountains of the himalayas , the crystal-clear still waters of its alpine lakes , or the huge expanse of its grasslands .
those missions could be as simple as just a few way points , or they could be slightly longer and more complicated , to fly along a river system .
now oil palm is a major driver of deforestation in that part of the world , so we wanted to use this new drone technology to keep track of the spread of these plantations in southeast asia .
now a drone could be designed to perform the task much more efficiently .
we 've had our fair share of skeptics and critics who thought that we were just fooling around with toy planes .
it 's titled " the culture of organs . "
this is actually like a cotton candy machine .
so you see the leaflets opening and closing -- of this heart valve that 's currently being used experimentally to try to get it to further studies .
and you can actually see here the printhead going through and printing this structure , and it takes about 40 minutes to print this structure .
because in reality , our biggest challenge are the solid organs .
this is dr. kang who 's been working with us on this project , and part of our team .
juan enriquez : these experiments sometimes work , and it 's very cool when they do .
i pulled them aside .
ts : those are permanent magnets , yeah .
i sort of think about it as the dna -- these colors , the red , blue , yellow , the primary colors and white and black .
you can always be changing colors , put aluminum paint , or i could put anything into this .
there 's something very appealing about the exactitude of science that i really enjoy .
i 'm left-handed , and so i draw .
and i wore it whenever i could , thinking it was the most fabulous thing i owned .
but at the same time , i started a micro-finance bank , and tomorrow iqbal quadir is going to talk about grameen , which is the grandfather of all micro-finance banks , which now is a worldwide movement -- you talk about a meme -- but then it was quite new , especially in an economy that was moving from barter into trade .
on a macro level , four billion people on earth make less than four dollars a day .
after one harvest , they had increased their income enough to buy a second system to do their full quarter-acre .
it contributes about 600,000 dollars in wages to the economy of tanzania .
and we 've started making curtains , and not only is it beautiful , but people can see status -- that you care about your children .
maybe we 'll go into the next tune , because i totally lost where this is going .
you just have to always adjust to what 's happening and realize you 'll have bummer notes come here and there and listen to it , adjust it , and just move on , or else you 'll get too tied up and go crazy . like me .
so i looked at all of his drawings , more than 700 , and looked for male portraits .
there is no reason why these portraits should look alike .
the first observation is something that you might think is quite obvious , and that 's that our species , homo sapiens , is actually really , really smart -- like , ridiculously smart -- like you 're all doing things that no other species on the planet does right now .
in some sense , where do our mistakes really come from ?
these are one of the guys i work with . this is a brown capuchin monkey .
but this is why , you know , they 're not in the queue behind you at the grocery store or the atm -- you know , they don 't do this stuff .
so here 's just a quick video of what this looks like .
and you can see that each of the experimenters is actually holding up a little , yellow food dish .
the monkeys entered the market , spent their entire budget and then went back to everyone else .
you can stick it in your wallet and use it immediately .
but people 's intuitions about how much risk to take varies depending on where they started with .
and then we gave them options that were bonuses -- like you guys did in the first scenario -- so they actually have a chance more , or pieces where they were experiencing losses -- they actually thought they were going to get more than they really got .
so they look like they 're starting out with a big amount .
a little bad for monkey investors .
this means that the biases that lead investors to do badly , that lead to the foreclosure crisis are going to be really hard to overcome .
and i 'm sitting in a waiting room some time later for an ultrasound , and all six of these doctors actually show up in the room at once , and i 'm like , " uh oh , this is bad news . "
so we 're going to actually do a live exam to sort of see how libby 's doing .
tb : okay . well let 's scan around a little bit here , give me a lay of the land .
so let 's start with care anywhere .
uncoordinated care today is expensive at best , and it is deadly at worst .
that 's the only way that the model works .
and at the end of all of that , they said , " yes , those diagnoses of that clash of medical titans all of those years ago were wrong , and we have a better path forward . "
but have you seen anything in nature , an animal that has three legs ?
this is just to show you that if you have cameras or different types of sensors -- because it is tall , it 's 1.8 meters tall -- you can see over obstacles like bushes and those kinds of things .
this is a very high mobility robot that we developed called impass .
and they already had a six legged robot called lemur .
there are a lot of really neat , very good robotic hands out there in the market .
now , this robot is currently our star robot .
i don 't know how many of you have heard about robocup .
and again , you 'll be able to see it in the lobby .
every day in the morning , the first thing i do before my first cup of coffee , before i brush my teeth , i open my notebook .
he gave a talk about how education and school kills creativity .
it 's true .
now it 's 2011 .
so let me just show you a couple of examples of what they used to look like .
and if we just scroll around , it 's just massive .
once you gain access to other people 's credit card information , you can just go online and buy whatever you want with this information .
so the internet is as if someone would have given free plane tickets to all the online criminals of the world .
it 's not used for anything .
and if you actually take a look at the scene picture , you can see that the plate of the mercedes is o600ko78rus .
everything is being run by computers .
i 'm extremely excited to be given the opportunity to come and speak to you today about what i consider to be the biggest stunt on earth .
he worked with john wayne and most of those old punch-ups you see in the westerns . yakima was either there or he stunt coordinated .
which i 'm sure you wouldn 't want .
we can flip lorries , coaches , buses , anything over with a nitrogen cannon with enough power .
it 's a bouncy castle with slats in the side to allow the air to escape .
and again , technology meant that i could do the fastest abseil over 100 meters , and stop within a couple of feet of the ground without melting the rope with the friction , because of the alloys i used in the descender device .
so it 's an extremely hostile place to be .
and it 's made of polyethylene , so it 's very thin .
this is morocco last year in the atlas mountains , training in preparation for some high altitude jumps .
we expect , and others expect , that perhaps the faa , the caa might say , " you need to put someone in a suit that 's not inflated , that 's connected to the aircraft . "
thank you very much for your time .
and what they did is they created an integral building element to improve the quality of the space that surrounds the visitors of the museum .
and he coined three terms , which are " focal glow , " " ambient luminescence " and " play of the brilliants " -- three very distinctly different ideas about light in architecture that all together make up this beautiful experience .
you can see here a photo from the united states library of medicine , where people are put in the sun to get better .
so at a global scale , it looks like this .
so here it is .
can we engage people more in the lighting projects that we create , so they really want to connect with it , like here ?
so i give you this wonderful , informative image of the sky , ranging from the inner city , where you may see one or two stars and nothing else , all the way to the rural environments , where you can enjoy this great and gorgeous and beautiful performance of the constellations and the stars .
i 'm going to argue tonight that compassion and the golden rule are , in a certain sense , built into human nature .
it 's not consciously self-serving , but to a biologist , that 's the logic .
none of us really extends the golden rule in truly diffuse and universal fashion .
if you ask what kind of a situation is conducive to people becoming friends and allies , the technical answer is a non-zero-sum situation .
and now i can admit that it might not too , now that i 've held your attention for three minutes of technical stuff .
so , there 's plenty of non-zero-sumness .
has there ever been somebody who disrespected you so much that you kind of hated them briefly " ?
i have my file which is called to do . i have my plans .
i have so much to say . i have to think what i am going to say .
and then finally it was prepared for the throwing .
and i got several answers , and i accepted the one which was farthest from home and practically , i thought , halfway to america .
this was a very dangerous accusation .
you have about 30,000 genes .
we just took the picture by turning the lights off in the room , and this is what we see .
then it has detectors on its back so it can sense how much starlight or moonlight is hitting its back .
but the one that 's probably the most important to you is virulence .
so this is just a picture -- a micrograph of your skin .
we thought , what if we made these bacteria so they can 't talk or they can 't hear ?
it recognizes when it has enough bacteria that now they 're going to launch their attack , and the animal dies .
but then , to finish with a plug for all the good and miraculous bacteria that live on the earth , we 've also made pro-quorum sensing molecules .
and i think it was best witnessed when thomas was playing the music as we came in the room today .
so , liberating these pages and imagine digitizing them and then storing them in a vast , interconnected , global repository .
a team of volunteers at the university of texas el paso , graduate students translating this engineering super textbook ideas and within about a week , having this be some of our most popular material in widespread use all over latin america and in particular in mexico , because of the open extensible nature of this .
it 's about 300 pages long , hardbound .
it 's semantic representation of comment , content , and what you can really think of xml in this case , is it 's the packaging that we 're putting around these pages .
it 's no wonder that everybody 's getting into it , right ?
not just text , but music , images , video , and there 's actually a tremendous uptake of the number of people that are actually licensing music to make it free for people who do this whole idea of re-sampling , rip , mixing , burning and sharing .
so , i am indeed going to talk about the spaces men create for themselves , but first i want to tell you why i 'm here .
it has neon concert posters , a bar and , of course , the leg lamp , which is very important .
here is another pretty typical scene . this is a suburban las vegas neighborhood .
i won 't be able to tell you what it is until it happens .
so if christian played a note -- like play an f.
it got a little bit more rhythmic , a little bit more intense in response to how i responded to it .
it has far more to do with what i can perceive than what it is that i can do .
in the case of the gastric brooding frog , we may have " fungicided " it to death .
he was the last person who had this frog , a colony of these things , in his lab .
and then again . and pretty soon , we had early stage embryos with hundreds of cells forming those .
it 's not what you usually think about as a kangaroo , but these are meat-eating kangaroos .
that was not what happened , actually .
we went into that pup to see what was in there , and we did find thylacine dna . it was a eureka moment .
that tasmanian devil 's not even going to know it gave birth .
i 've even spoken to people , like peter carter here , who when i spoke to him was 90 years old , but in 1926 , this man and his father and his brother caught thylacines . they trapped them .
is that all we would do ? and this is an interesting question .
his land was no longer registered in his name .
it 's a space that 's more intuitive in which i present fragments of the story , beginnings of other stories , photographic evidence .
as a result of these transactions , jura has nine wives , 32 children and 63 grandchildren .
now this was done to counter the annual celebration of rabbits and presumably make the public more comfortable with the killing of rabbits and promote an animal that 's native to australia , and actually an animal that is threatened by the european rabbit .
everyone showed up .
so this is the ferraz family and the novaes family .
children bathe infrequently because the hot water isn 't turned on until october .
in most of my work , what i do is i seal the edges of a book with a thick varnish so it 's creating sort of a skin on the outside of the book so it becomes a solid material , but then the pages inside are still loose , and then i carve into the surface of the book , and i 'm not moving or adding anything .
so there 's sort of a yin-yang that happens , sort of a flip flop .
instead , i 'll be talking about the main cause at the root of this issue , which i will be referring to as the phosphorus crisis .
i 'd like everyone to understand precisely what the phosphorus issue is .
so , in order to understand these issues , where do we find our phosphorus ?
so , we get phosphorus from mines .
remember that 80 percent is destined to be lost .
and it is through this structure that mutual exchanges will occur .
this is an example of soy production in canada .
it doesn 't divide by three .
there 's a lot of conflict , and the question is , how do we deal with our differences ?
well that system is , i think , probably the system that kept us alive to this point , given our human tendencies .
and my mind started racing , " puerto rico ? what do i know about puerto rico ? "
whether we 're christians , muslims or jews , religious or non-religious , we feel we have a personal stake in it .
he 's the one who reminds us that we 're all part of a greater whole .
now if i were to come to you face-to-face and come this close to you , you would feel threatened .
how many of you have ever had that experience ?
it brought us hope .
the path right now is like an acorn ; it 's still in its early phase .
so let me just leave you with three things .
i put half the lab up in my house .
it fed the slaves brought to the antilles , the song " jamaica farewell " -- " ackee rice salt fish are nice " -- is an emblem of the importance of salt cod from northeastern canada .
and the habitat destruction is unbelievable .
it runs down the rivers , and it feeds the plankton , the little microscopic plant cells in the coastal water .
it was when i was on holiday last early autumn in france .
they kick them out , and then they die .
we say it becomes more strongly stratified .
a hundred years ago we were looking at coal , of course , and we were looking at whale oil and we were looking at crude oil .
raise your hand if you think you know .
and when you look at what we 're using the oil for , 70 percent of it is used for transportation fuel .
so where are we headed from here ?
how does that translate to barrels of oil equivalent ?
so i think i 've made my point that we have to get on our own resources in america .
we found out that we could go to the source rock , which were the carboniferous shales in the basins .
no , no . the argument that it 's a bridge fuel makes sense , because the amount of co2 per unit of energy is lower than oil and coal , correct ?
i mean , that was told to be a bad idea 10 times , they went ahead and did it anyway .
i witnessed my first frack job at border texas in 1953 .
and if you look at california , they use 2,500 buses .
human beings start putting each other into boxes the second that they see each other -- is that person dangerous ? are they attractive ?
and this can get really dangerous .
kids would often come up to me in class and grab me by the throat to check for an adam 's apple or grab my crotch to check what i was working with .
and i remember watching the discussion on television and thinking how interesting it was that the separation of church and state was essentially drawing geographical boundaries throughout this country , between places where people believed in it and places where people didn 't .
life magazine introduced generations of people to distant , far-off cultures they never knew existed through pictures .
so far we 've shot 300 faces in new york city .
in fact , on the contrary , it highlights them .
or is it over here by the people who have only had one or two homosexual experiences thus far ?
twenty or 30 years ago , if a bank in north america lent too much money to some people who couldn 't afford to pay it back and the bank went bust , that was bad for the lender and bad for the borrower , but we didn 't imagine it would bring the global economic system to its knees for nearly a decade .
they don 't have minds that telescope .
but actually , aren 't most of us not really so very good at empathy ?
and one of the exceptions , the interesting exception , is when you can show to people that there might be some self-interest in them making that leap of faith and changing a little bit .
we primarily admire countries that are good .
this is a country which simply gives more to humanity than any other country .
countries like china and russia and india , which is down in the same part of the index , well , in some ways , it 's not surprising .
that 's what i would like you to do , and i 'd like you to use it as a stick with which to beat your politicians .
ok . so i mean , this is the kind of status quo interface , right ?
so it 's cute , but it 's also like a subtle channel of conveying information , right ?
he 's about my age , and he 's in san quentin state prison .
how do we know that it 's wrong ? maybe you and i disagree .
that 's plato , descartes , nietzsche and bill clinton .
but i can surely tell you that in my country , much like on wall street and the city of london and elsewhere , men were at the helm of the game of the financial sector , and that kind of lack of diversity and sameness leads to disastrous problems .
so while we want to make economic profit for ourselves and our customers , we are willing to do it with a long-term view , and we like to have a wider definition of profits than just the economic profit in the next quarter .
and i want to tell you when i first realized that women matter to the economy and to the society , i was seven -- it happened to be my mother 's birthday -- october 24 , 1975 .
my job is to design , build and study robots that communicate with people .
and i still had this dream to make an actual , physical luxo jr. lamp .
and in that situation we can easily imagine robots in the near future being there with us .
and this book shows actors how to move every muscle in the body to match every kind of emotion that they want to express .
you can see when i psych it out , it gets fooled .
whereas the people with the calculated brain said it was just like a lazy apprentice .
and at some point can even be surprised by what the robot came up with .
and at some point , we are in atlanta , so obviously some rapper will come into our lab at some point .
and it 's not just fun and games .
i can guarantee , everyone in this room , all of you over there , the people in the cushy seats , the people up top with the laptops -- we all have bodies .
and how are they transformed by wearing it ?
so when a plant is thirsty , it can actually make a phone call or post a message to a service like twitter .
and so since we use devices to figure out how to relate to the world these days , i actually made a device called the glacier embracing suit .
and we 're going to do it very specifically planned to not learn anything new .
but , you know , nasa screwed that up because they 've sent these robots and they 've landed it only in the deserts .
these two new airplanes are the same speed as the dc8 that was done in 1958 .
that 's -- you don 't want to run a business with that kind of a safety record .
there 's a group of people that have come forward -- and you don 't know all of them -- but the ones that have come forward were inspired as young children , this little three- to 15-year-old age , by us going to orbit and going to the moon here , right in this time period .
but america lost . we lost . and because of that , we made a big jump to recover it .
but nasa is developing the space liner , always has , and runs the only space line , ok . and we 've shied away from it because we 're afraid of it . but starting back in june of 2004 , when i showed that a little group out there actually can do it , can get a start with it , everything changed after that time .
this huge mass of all these stars keeps stars in circular orbits in the galaxy .
or if we look in other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum , we see that there 's a lot of gas in this cluster , as well .
we extrapolate backwards and say the galaxy is up here .
so it 's got the right shape to produce the lensing .
so this is the closest you can get to kind of seeing at least the effects of the dark matter with your naked eye .
by how much less is it expanding today , compared to , say , a couple of billion years ago ?
we have well-motivated candidates for the dark matter .
so in terms of the big questions : what is dark matter ? what is dark energy ?
this is what happens when you route these electrical storms to a loudspeaker and you listen to a hundred brain cells firing , your brain will sound like this -- my brain , any brain .
and to our shock , that 's exactly what aurora did .
and the feedback that comes from the avatar is being processed directly by the brain without the interference of the skin .
our violins , our cars , our bicycles , our soccer balls , our clothing -- they all become assimilated by this voracious , amazing , dynamic system called the brain .
so i was told about 10 years ago that this would never happen , that this was close to impossible .
oil is a stew of hydrocarbon molecules .
when the chemistry of the oil and water also hits our politics , it 's absolutely explosive .
well , the reason is , is because , when we 're buying gas , we 're very invested in this sort of cognitive dissonance .
it was terrifying ; you think walmart is a terrifying business model now , imagine what this looked like in the 1860s or 1870s .
they really influence people .
we only have two percent of the world 's oil reserves ; 65 percent of them are in the persian gulf .
this is 1988 -- we actually bombed two iranian oil platforms that year .
the moratoriums are fine , but we do need to focus on the molecules on the oil .
i actually -- i agree that a dollar a gallon on oil is probably too much , but i think that if we started this year with three cents a gallon on gasoline , and upped it to six cents next year , nine cents the following year , all the way up to 30 cents by 2020 , that we could actually significantly reduce our gasoline consumption , and at the same time we would give people time to prepare , time to respond , and we would be raising money and raising consciousness at the same time .
so going back to 1989 , i wrote a memo suggesting the global hypertext system .
it 's difficult to explain to people now that it was difficult then .
turns out that there is still huge unlocked potential .
we 're using them for people , we 're using them for places , we 're using them for your products , we 're using them for events .
the meme went out there .
it 's actual useful . it 's got value .
and it 's not just america . it 's all over the world .
bing ! relationship . data .
you may not have lots of data which you have yourself to put on there but you know to demand it .
four hundred and fifty million of them are in africa , and five million of them are in south africa .
at least once a week .
and we all know people who have lots of misfortune , misfortune that we ourselves would not want to have , and they are deeply happy .
that 's how gratefulness happens .
does that mean that we can be grateful for everything ?
how can each one of us find a method for living gratefully , not just once in a while being grateful , but moment by moment to be grateful .
you look . you open your eyes .
what we need is a networking of smaller groups , smaller and smaller groups who know one another , who interact with one another , and that is a grateful world .
the smallest sound you can perceive moves your eardrum just four atomic diameters .
two percent of the population of europe -- that 's 16 million people -- are having their sleep devastated by noise like that .
the third problem with headphones is this : deafness -- noise-induced hearing disorder .
sound design is the future , and i think it 's the way we 're going to change the way the world sounds .
and let 's take a stewarding role for the sound around us .
and that 's not the only place it 's found .
this is crazy .
if you 're in china , you might use a rice husk or a cottonseed hull .
but it 's much faster than conventional farming .
over the last two decades , india has become a global hub for software development and offshoring of back office services , as we call it , and what we were interested in finding out was that because of this huge industry that has started over the last two decades in india , offshoring software development and back office services , there 's been a flight of white collar jobs from the developed world to india .
you must have gotten your education here . "
what he did was he looked at those companies that had an r & amp ; amp ; d center in usa and in india , and then he looked at a patent that was filed out of the u.s. and a similar patent filed out of the same company 's subsidiary in india , so he 's now comparing the patents of r & amp ; amp ; d centers in the u.s. with r & amp ; amp ; d centers in india of the same company to find out what is the quality of the patents filed out of the indian centers and how do they compare with the quality of the patents filed out of the u.s. centers ?
what the global delivery model allows is , it allows you to take previously geographically core-located tasks , break them up into parts , send them around the world where the expertise and the cost structure exists , and then specify the means for reintegrating them .
in fact , if you look at the number of patents filed over history , i think they are in the top or the top two or three companies in the world of all patents filed in the usa as a private company .
and i am not a complete pacifist like some of my really , really heavy-duty , non-violent friends , like mairead mcguire .
it is all of those things .
she is already out in the streets , working with the party to try to rebuild it .
people could not gather without getting busted and taken to jail .
that 's what i got stuck doing -- the landmine campaign .
but i 'm also smiling because i thought it represented a sense of hopefulness that our profession could play a role in helping the city to think about how it would recover from its severe crisis .
citywide , there are 80,000 vacant homes .
so 2010 , we started this process , and by 2013 , we released detroit future city , which was our strategic plan to guide the city into a better and more prosperous and more sustainable existence -- not what it was , but what it could be , looking at new ways of economic growth , new forms of land use , more sustainable and denser neighborhoods , a reconfigured infrastructure and city service system , and a heightened capacity for civic leaders to take action and implement change .
and as it happened , i read it from midnight to five in the morning in one shot .
and today , you would see this inside the mine , half a mile underground .
so they wait until winter -- the lake is completely frozen over -- and they use this meter-thick ice as a platform on which to establish their ice camp and do their work .
and the more you understand that , the better you would understand what this dark energy that the universe is made of is all about .
and you barely might be able to make out this hut here .
in order to minimize the weight , it 's very thin , it 's as thin as a sandwich wrapper .
and it was very obvious that , if we destroy these silent places on earth , we will be stuck on a planet without the ability to look outwards , because we will not be able to understand the signals that come from outer space .
and i can 't see myself going into a state prison in new jersey and making such a proposition , but this being israel , the warden somehow made it happen .
i 've had it . "
and he ended up in south tel aviv and did not have the good luck to be picked up by a [ unclear ] and roamed the streets and became a prominent gang member .
so these are words like " teamwork " or " endurance " or even complicated concepts like " resource allocation " or " perspective , " a word that they don 't understand .
we walked 120 kilometers until we reached sudan .
and you should be really afraid , but not for the reasons why you think you should be .
we can date it to 700 years ago .
and by now you should be getting a hint as to how diverse and how important and how interesting this journey into life is , and how many different life forms there are , and how there can be different life forms living in very different places , maybe even outside of this planet .
conservation group gets together , tries to figure out how to breed an animal that 's almost extinct .
and it will be really boring . it will read like this .
the reason why he 's reprogramming that animal to have more wings is because when you used to play with lizards as a little child , and you picked up the lizard , sometimes the tail fell off , but it regrew .
mice and men are the same . wives know that , but anyway .
so , all of you know that the price of computers halves every 18 months and the power doubles , right ?
same thing in massachusetts . looks more spread out but -- oh , by the way , the ones that are the same color are contiguous .
you can take a harvard-educated ivy league economist , stick him in charge of argentina . he still crashes the country because he doesn 't understand how the rules have changed .
but thank you very much .
what are the environments that lead to unusual levels of innovation , unusual levels of creativity ?
these are standard in all the industrialized worlds .
another is newton and the apple , when newton was at cambridge .
they want to say , " there i was , i was standing there and i had it all suddenly clear in my head . "
now a couple of companies -- like google -- they have innovation time off , 20 percent time , where , in a sense , those are hunch-cultivating mechanisms in an organization .
and after a couple of hours , they actually start picking up the signal , because the soviets made sputnik very easy to track .
could you figure out an unknown location on the ground , if you knew the location of the satellite ? "
and some of you may argue , well , don 't today 's cell phones do that already ?
but the difference here is that you can use any surface , you can walk to up to any surface , including your hand if nothing else is available and interact with this projected data .
and , if you need to know what the current time is it 's as simple as drawing a watch -- on your arm .
and radio waves are limited .
you don 't want to get close to gamma rays , it could be dangerous .
look at the ceiling , you see all these light bulbs .
but not only that .
this is a smart academic doing a little bit of tricks here . "
i don 't mention the high energy efficiency of these led light bulbs .
and you only have to notice , where we have light , there is a potential way to transmit data .
and in the future , you would not only have 14 billion light bulbs , you may have 14 billion li-fis deployed worldwide -- for a cleaner , a greener , and even a brighter future .
we 've talked earlier -- this wonderful talk by wade davis about the different cultures of the humans around the world -- but the world is not composed only of human beings ; there are also other animal beings .
if she has a bad run , and her score isn 't good , she 'll come and reach up and tap on the glass -- because she can 't see the experimenter -- which is asking to have another go .
the long-term affectionate supportive bonds that develop throughout this long childhood with the mother , with the brothers and sisters , and which can last through a lifetime , which may be up to 60 years .
and this has led in congo basin , and other parts of the world , to what is known as the bush-meat trade .
we can do it by talking to each other ; we can do it through video ; we can do it through the written word .
and i looked in the eyes of my little grandchildren , and think how much we 've harmed this planet since i was their age .
it 's going to depend which part , say , of america they 're in .
that 's not the way to solve problems .
and we 've talked a lot about that .
so i am a pediatric cancer doctor and stem-cell researcher at stanford university where my clinical focus has been bone marrow transplantation .
instead of entering the bone dozens of times , we enter just once , into the front of the hip or the back of the hip .
in the last decade there 's been an explosion of use of bone marrow stem cells to treat the patient 's other diseases such as heart disease , vascular disease , orthopedics , tissue engineering , even in neurology to treat parkinson 's and diabetes .
but the thing that struck me is , one guy said in exasperation , a very famous neurobiologist , he said , " look , in my discipline it 's okay to be interested in consciousness , but get tenure first . get tenure first . "
okay , now i promised you to tell you some of the outrageous things said about consciousness .
i think it 's rather easy to define if you 're not trying to give a scientific definition .
you can 't get rid of it .
okay , the next feature of consciousness , after this marvelous unified conscious field , is that it functions causally in our behavior .
but we know that that 's purely syntactical . that 's symbolic .
i spent a lot of money on this hardware .
it 's new technology . you look through them and the world you see is augmented with data : names of places , monuments , buildings , maybe one day even the names of the strangers that pass you on the street .
there is the color red and the color black , representing the constant change from day to night .
whoa .
the average teenager sends 3,339 text messages a month , unless she 's a girl , then it 's closer to 4,000 .
that last one 's an actual text message that we received .
and so they started following and watching petty thefts , summonses , all kinds of things -- charting the future essentially .
and eventually these dots went from being perfectly round to looking more like tadpoles , because of the shake .
and then when i got home , i sat down and i set myself to task to really try to create something just completely outside of the box .
i slept on the floor and i ate takeout , and i asked people to call me and share a story with me about a life-changing moment .
when i think back to my three years away from art , away from my dream , just going through the motions , instead of trying to find a different way to continue that dream , i just quit , i gave up .
so today i 'm here to argue that this is not at all an esoteric ivory tower activity that we find at our universities , but that broad study across species , tissue types and organ systems can produce insights that have direct implications for human health .
before it can be used for internal fertilization , its mechanical behavior has to change in a really dramatic fashion .
because there was no mechanism in this explanation for making this structure hard to bend .
so you can see that the fibers wrap in helices , and those fibers can reorient as the skeleton moves , which means the skeleton 's flexible .
i 'm going to show a model made out of exactly the same materials .
who has experienced a lot of stress ?
now , if that estimate is correct , that would make believing stress is bad for you the 15th largest cause of death in the united states last year , killing more people than skin cancer , hiv / aids and homicide .
that guy made a mistake .
over a lifetime of stressful experiences , this one biological change could be the difference between a stress-induced heart attack at age 50 and living well into your 90s .
but here 's what most people don 't understand about oxytocin .
they also asked , " how much time have you spent helping out friends , neighbors , people in your community ? "
and so i would say that 's really the best way to make decisions , is go after what it is that creates meaning in your life and then trust yourself to handle the stress that follows .
the reason , i think , is that the pensioners believe they 've chosen to be pensioners , whereas the young unemployed feel it 's been thrust upon them .
pay 20,000 pounds to endow a hospital ward and you 're called a philanthropist .
for 0.01 percent of this money you could have put wifi on the trains , which wouldn 't have reduced the duration of the journey , but would have improved its enjoyment and its usefullness far more .
which isn 't a great idea .
i propose that we can use psychology to solve problems that we didn 't even realize were problems at all .
so where economists make the fundamental mistake is they think that money is money .
and he used this following analogy .
that 's pretty good .
i will do so with the help of words , of course , but also a geometrical shape , the circle , so throughout my talk , you will come across several circles .
we all do .
and thus began my life-long passion for writing fiction .
i lived in a very vibrant , diverse neighborhood where i wrote several of my novels .
and this is what i discovered in boston -- that frustration was very stimulating .
you 're expected to write informative , poignant and characteristic stories and leave the experimental and avant-garde to your western colleagues .
some people criticized , others praised me for writing about the turkish-armenian conflict .
today , stories continue to transcend borders .
we see them as the domain of supernatural creatures like the djinn , who are made of smokeless fire and are the symbol of elusiveness .
when i 'm walking around an art gallery , rooms and rooms full of paintings , after about 15 or 20 minutes , i realize i 'm not thinking about the paintings .
i don 't even know why they make me slow down , but something pulls me like a magnet and then i ignore all the others , and i just go to that painting .
now i began to think of it as a portrait of a relationship .
it would have been a chaotic , noisy household .
they would have spent the time alone , all that time .
and he never does .
i kept thinking of beds and red cheeks , and of course i kept thinking of sex when i looked at him , and i thought , is that what he 's thinking about ?
when i made the announcement , george did not turn rosy , but went pale as my doublet .
thank you .
anyway , as i plunged through my 20s ever more aware of how unobtainable the first part of my childhood ambition was , it was that second part , being able to successfully communicate to others whatever knowledge i was gaining , where the futility of my quest really set in .
they were lifted verbatim from palin 's own remarks .
and the comedy comes along , dealing with a lot of the same areas where our defenses are the strongest -- race , religion , politics , sexuality -- only by approaching them through humor instead of adrenalin , we get endorphins and the alchemy of laughter turns our walls into windows , revealing a fresh and unexpected point of view .
and this isn 't some new phenomenon of our wired world .
cartoon : " what if it 's a big hoax and we create a better world for nothing ? "
her answer was quite the contrary .
and i think a lot of people in this room , i can see a lot of you are in the same position as myself .
ask me .
we will open the museum in a few days , and i welcome all of you to get on qatar airways and come and join us .
play by yourself then .
familiarity destroys and trumps fear . try it .
what the site 's known for , because it has this environment , is it 's fostered the creation of a lot of internet phenomena , viral videos and whatnot , known as " memes . "
and / b / is known for , more than anything , not just the memes they 've created , but the exploits .
dusty is the name that we 've given to this cat .
don 't tell .
99 percent of it is just , would have been , you know , bleeped out .
that 's very cool .
now the remarkable thing about blood vessels is that they have this ability to adapt to whatever environment they 're growing in .
and under the microscope , you can see hundreds of these brown staining blood vessels , capillaries that are feeding cancer cells , bringing oxygen and nutrients .
and we can do this because tumor blood vessels are unlike normal , healthy vessels we see in other places of the body : they 're abnormal ; they 're very poorly constructed ; and , because of that , they 're highly vulnerable to treatments that target them .
it had already spread to his lymph nodes , so we used an antiangiogenic skin cream for the lip and an oral cocktail , so we could treat from the inside as well as the outside .
but i actually took a completely opposite approach and began asking : what could we be adding to our diet that 's naturally antiangiogenic , that could boost the body 's defense system and beat back those blood vessels that are feeding cancers ?
here 's some more data from our testing .
check out this ad from blue cross blue shield of minnesota .
i have a quick question for you . so these drugs aren 't exactly ...
the acid rain was falling on the forests .
and that 's because they 're both designed to fit the human hand .
but if you have a sexual species , then it 's possible for an individual to inherit both mutations from different lineages .
adam takes four hours to make a spear and three hours to make an axe .
and back in 1880 , it would have been 15 minutes to earn that amount of light on the average wage .
but a modern tourist going around the palace of versailles and looking at louis xiv 's pictures , he has 498 people doing his dinner tonight too .
it isn 't always quite that simple , but there 's a distinction between specialized roles for males and females .
they 're always made from local chert .
how many of the things in our pockets could we continue to make after 10,000 years ?
and by the way , that 's one of the reasons that i 'm not interested in the debate about i.q. , about whether some groups have higher i.q.s than other groups .
how many of you here could describe the sound of a single planet or star ?
now you have to remember , this is 10 years before heinrich hertz proved the existence of radio waves -- 15 years before nikola tesla 's four-tuned circuit -- nearly 20 years before marconi 's first broadcast .
now any astronomer will tell you , this is the telltale sign of something that doesn 't originate from earth .
this is the noise that penzias and wilson heard -- the oldest sound that you 're ever going to hear , the cosmic microwave background radiation left over from the big bang .
it was hunted to death for its feathers .
well , you 'd start by finding out if the biotech is really there .
there 's just some bits that are band-tailed pigeon .
the aurochs is the ancestor of all domestic cattle , and so basically its genome is alive , it 's just unevenly distributed .
you get a male and a female each of those , and out of them comes falcons .
everybody thought is was finished .
tinker bell is going to come fluttering down .
stewart brand : well , the earlier point is we interfered in a big way by making these animals go extinct , and many of them were keystone species , and we changed the whole ecosystem they were in by letting them go .
so i quit my dream job , and i moved to new orleans , and i kept on studying how the oil spill was happening .
this is low speed , low wind speed , and the maneuverability is very increased , and here i 'm going to do a small jibe , and look at the position of the sail .
an airplane , when you 're moving in this direction , starts to lift , and that 's how it takes off .
we were peer-learning , we were engineering , we were making things , prototyping , but most importantly we were trying our prototypes in the water as often as possible , to fail as quickly as possible , to learn from .
you are laying down in a flexible torpedo , sailing at high speed , controlling the shape of the hull with your legs and controlling the sail with your arms .
so even though a signal may come from the same functional part of the brain , by the time the structure has been folded , its physical location is very different between individuals , even identical twins .
so the first thing we need to do with the cognitive suite is to start with training a neutral signal .
so what you want to do -- at least with movement-based actions , we do that all the time , so you can visualize it .
the technology can also be applied to real world applications -- in this example , a smart home .
i didn 't see abed coming .
i said i wanted to meet .
were all of us the results of things done to us , done for us , the infidelity of a parent or spouse , money inherited ?
i listened to her words . i suppose they were true .
it was this youth who on may 16 , 1990 , had broken two necks including mine , and bruised one brain and taken one life .
some , as had abed , would forget the date .
with a nod to jewish custom , he told me that i should live to be 120 years old .
i told him only that he had killed one man , not two .
so i went out and i bought a lot of pins that would , in fact , reflect what i thought we were going to do on any given day .
well the interesting part was i was asked what it was like to be the first woman secretary of state a few minutes after i 'd been named .
and so what i have felt -- and i have looked at this from a national security issue -- when i was secretary of state , i decided that women 's issues had to be central to american foreign policy , not just because i 'm a feminist , but because i believe that societies are better off when women are politically and economically empowered , that values are passed down , the health situation is better , education is better , there is greater economic prosperity .
pm : is that " girl 7 ? " girl 7 .
and so then tarja was sitting across the table from me .
thank you all . thanks pat .
and they really , really do .
and those two coils of wire are really , really close to each other , and actually do transfer power magnetically and wirelessly , only over a very short distance .
they 've pretty much set field exposure limits , which all of the things in the stuff i 'll show you today sort of sit underneath those guidelines .
it will cause one to get created on the other side .
this a google g1 .
so i think in closing , sort of in the immortal visions of the new yorker magazine , i thought i 'd put up one more slide .
because apparently you can 't have this fragile isotope of lithium-6 in the atmospheres of sun-like stars .
a hot gas is producing emission lines only , no continuum .
we have been dealing with a similarly very weak feature , which belongs to osmium .
and later we went to study the spectral stars to see is there anything strange with these objects .
and this is going to be an instrument to detect earth-like planets around sun-like stars .
and then you have to convince the whole world that you have actually detected something like this in the atmosphere of an extrasolar planet host star somewhere in 100 parsec away from here .
they want to actually signal their presence through these spectral lines , in the spectrum of a star , in different ways .
thank you very much .
until , in may 2008 , a routine visit to my doctor and a routine blood test produced evidence in the form of an alkaline phosphatase number that something might be wrong with my bones .
a few days later , i woke with an idea of how i might give them that voice .
because you don 't need the get-to-know-you session at that point .
and jeff came up beside me and said , " so , have you ever been cow tipping ? "
you can bend over and look at your reflection in the mirror and maybe run your finger and make a small ripple , or you can jump in and thrash around and see what it feels like , what it smells like . "
and one night i had a nightmare that i was walking through my house , sat at my desk and saw photographs of someone else 's children sitting on my desk .
and when people came to me , rather than being incredibly turned off by what they saw -- i was like a living ghost -- they were incredibly moved to talk about what was going on in their own lives .
he gives boring speeches about obscure bottles of wine , and on his 50th birthday he bought a convertible sports car -- although , like a lot of men , he 's impatient ; he bought it on his 49th .
and yet , for the four million years humans have been walking upright , the act is essentially unchanged .
by laying fallow , i planted the seeds for a healthier future and was reunited with the ones i love .
and we encourage anybody to join this effort .
and by this weird quirk of alphabetical order of the nations , a lot of the low-lying states , like kiribati and nauru , they were seated at the very end of these immensely long rows .
there 's air-sea interactions .
this is the ship that i spent the last three months on in the antarctic .
so that ice sheet is partly floating , and it 's exposed to the ocean , to the ocean heat .
and these plants need sunlight , so we know when we find that sediment there 's no ice overhead .
this is from champion island .
and we started working on it , and we figured out we could tell the temperature of the ancient ocean from analyzing a coral like this .
and we just count on down to the bottom .
and i chose this one because it 's complicated and messy looking , right .
so , you cannot argue with that .
now , what that means is that all of the organisms that live in the sea have evolved in this chemostatted ocean , with co2 levels lower than they are today .
it 's like the land and the king they 're inseparable , they are one .
so what happens if you start to explain space to them ?
here , the real world merges with the simulation .
and the great thing about it was that alex was so dedicated to the idea of verisimilitude , the idea that the putative 2054 that we were painting in the film be believable , that he allowed us to take on that design work as if it were an r & amp ; d effort .
so if we don 't like stuff , or we 're intensely curious about ernst haeckel 's scientific falsifications , we can pull them out like that .
that 's the old way , that 's the old mantra : one machine , one human , one mouse , one screen .
we at oblong believe that media should be accessible in much more fine-grained form .
when real ? when for us , not just in a lab and on a stage ?
so , whether it 's logistics and supply chain management or natural gas and resource extraction , financial services , pharmaceuticals , bioinformatics , those are the topics right now , but that 's not a killer app .
and then there was a silence -- one of those awful silences when you know something 's wrong .
no special needs schools .
and then i managed a restaurant , and then i slipped on things .
and it 's frightening , isn 't it ?
why are you fighting so hard not to be yourself ?
really not a very sensible thing to do .
i was crumpled .
i know how to be mowgli .
i left , and i became a social entrepreneur , and i set up an organization with mark shand called elephant family , which deals with asian elephant conservation .
i simply needed vision and belief .
and they got fabulously wealthy in doing so .
and the chinese respond in a very ugly way .
that 's what you want .
and back home , what do you see ?
there are a lot of countries , oil-producing countries , that aren 't very democratic , but supported by the united states .
well , obviously , when people die in the war , they are muslims , they are iraqis -- they 're not americans .
you know what it means .
you 've got to see this -- bible boot camp .
that 's what they are to you .
she 's my sister , my wife , my cousin , my neighbor .
and maybe they succeeded . maybe they succeeded .
now , you might ask , " okay , sam , so why do you do this sort of thing ?
and now perhaps -- perhaps -- you do too .
so when netra and i sat down to make our first plan 10 years ago , we said we want the focus of this plan to go way beyond ourselves .
anyway , you know , i really make decisions all the time about how i want to remember myself , and that 's the most important kind of decisions i make .
i can actually visualize my future approaching .
history as an imaging tool ?
good morning .
now , each year we perform about 300,000 surgeries .
if you think about it , i think the eyeball is the same , as american or african , the problem is the same , the treatment is the same .
so i think we have a process by which we can really penetrate into the market and reach everyone who needs it , and in this process of using technology , make sure that most don 't need to come to the base hospital .
i think that has been a big savior , even now .
we looked at cost .
i do a radio show .
this is a wonderful thing .
unlike the occupants of the universe , the universe itself is not wasteful .
you may well have your own children and think , " oh no , my child 's best . "
if you actually think , you remove the myth and there is still something wonderful .
i have chosen to make silly jokes about quantum mechanics and the copenhagen interpretation .
and that 's not a good experience when you 're used to experiences like this .
each one of them found this .
so let 's look at the concept of traditional anthropology .
so , in the same way that you wake up , take a shower and get dressed , you have to learn to do that for your digital self .
it gets adopted because people use it and it 's made for humans .
one i 'm really worried about is that people aren 't taking time for mental reflection anymore , and that they aren 't slowing down and stopping , being around all those people in the room all the time that are trying to compete for their attention on the simultaneous time interfaces , paleontology and panic architecture .
and i started grappling with this existential angst of what little i had done with my life .
as a matter of fact , this picture is supposed to be me during training .
and there are all kinds of problems .
is this an envelope we 're living inside of , or no , does it go onto infinity in both time and space ?
the most venomous animal that lives in the ocean is the box jellyfish .
i didn 't get out , but was in the water taking prednisone shots , taking xanax , oxygen to the face .
we 've got benadryl on board . if i get stung , i 'll just grin and bear it .
i finished the swim like this .
thank you .
and if you read the press , it actually last week said i quit the media lab .
steve jobs had given us some laptops ; we were in senegal .
it 's a nonprofit association ; it raised about 20 million dollars to do the engineering to just get this built , and then have it produced afterwards .
well , no , it 's not a laptop project . it 's an education project .
and we 've been going steadily downhill .
now , i 'm going to pass this around .
it 's kind of agonizing , because a lot of people say , " well , let 's do it at the state level , " because , of course , states are more nimble than the feds , just because of size .
it looks like a post office truck .
well , on december 12 , a company called quanta agreed to build it , and since they make about one-third of all the laptops on the planet today , that question disappeared .
we 're told what shape we 're supposed to be in .
my parents got divorced , and my sister was arrested .
and i think , i truly believe , that we can change this thing one laugh at a time .
and when we heard a lot of the presentations over the last couple of days , ed wilson and the pictures of james nachtwey , i think we all realized how far we have to go to get to this new version of humanity that i like to call " humanity 2.0 . "
i started a couple of businesses that i thought would be the ticket to financial freedom .
these leading , innovative , nonprofit folks , who are using business skills in a very leveraged way to solve social problems .
so , in 2003 , i started to make my way around los angeles to talk about the idea of a pro-social media company and i was met with a lot of encouragement .
and then the movie about this person doing these things , then led to this greater renewal .
and it 's the true story of congressman charlie wilson , and how he funded the taliban to fight the russians in afghanistan .
and i guess many of you here think that this is quite fantastic -- except for me . i don 't agree with this .
i actually like that one .
i would cut my costs by 90 percent .
actually it sounded nice in the beginning , but when you look at 600 summaries , it 's quite a lot .
so here it is , a crowd-sourced , six-word summary of a thousand tedtalks at the value of $ 99.50 : " why the worry ? i 'd rather wonder . "
the great majority of organisms on earth remain unknown to science .
at this point i think we have a little impressionistic film that was made especially for this occasion .
each has persisted for thousands to millions of years .
only about 15 percent of the known species have been studied well enough to evaluate their status .
technology has moved forward .
just absolutely amazing , every single dive .
here we 're going to see one backing into a crevice , and watch his tentacles -- he just pulls them in , makes them look just like algae .
just an amazing animal , it can change color and texture to match the surroundings . watch him blend right into this algae .
and now it goes from -- yes , now it goes from left to right .
can i have the feeler here ?
the wind may turn , but the animal will turn always its nose into the wind .
but after having lost a beloved teacher in 2006 and a good friend last year to suicide , and sitting last year at tedactive , i knew that i needed to step out of my silence and past my taboos to talk about an idea worth spreading -- and that is that people who have made the difficult choice to come back to life need more resources and need our help .
the answer turns out to be two percent .
first of all , there is a suggestion of some error .
he really has no idea as to what 's actually going on in the world .
i 'm obviously not going to be able to do that for you today , so let me just present to you two headlines as an illustration of what i have in mind .
but i will first teach you a method , how you can do it without moving the wrist , and then the shortcut .
i talked to a nice girl before , zoe .
and here , i had a mat here to make it a little -- the critical moment is -- sorry .
now , if you are interested , i will demonstrate some underground techniques .
shuffle tracking means i keep track of the cards , even if another person shuffles .
right ?
the new chaos theory is already old , right ?
ok . another person . oh , i forgot , i shouldn 't shuffle but i think -- -- actually , my technique is to peek , all the time .
maybe you will cut ? lift .
and now , when i lift this card , it shall be your card . what was your card ?
right , sorry , my -- i should have mentioned that , yeah .
so here , here i have to peek , lots of cards .
there was the place . and here is king of spades , correct ?
we try . yeah . you help me .
i look -- shake the cards , so i don 't .
so now i have to improvise again .
lg : yeah . also listen .
eight .
touch me , feel -- ah , ah , you know !
rob legato : i pretend they 're clapping for me .
so i showed him this , and this is actual footage that he was on . this is apollo 15 . this was his mission .
so here 's the behind the scenes , a couple of little shots here .
now , " hugo " was another interesting movie , because the movie itself is about film illusions .
what do you think was the reason ? "
so i thought , forget the rock opera , forget the bombast , my usual tricks .
and this great news gives birth to even more great news , because the historic trend is this .
there are all kinds of benefits to this .
you can tell politicians that these cuts [ can cost ] lives .
so i 'm here to -- i guess we 're here to try and infect you with this virtuous , data-based virus , the one we call factivism .
so i 'm going to talk about work , specifically why people can 't seem to get work done at work , which is a problem we all kind of have .
i 'll hear things like an extra room in the house , the basement , the coffee shop , the library .
i went to these meetings i was asked to go to .
so sleep is about sleep phases , or stages -- some people call them different things .
i understand . i know how this goes .
the real problems are what i like to call the m & amp ; ms , the managers and the meetings .
i mean , what are the chances that all 10 people are ready to stop ?
so i have some suggestions to remedy the situation .
and maybe , hopefully you can do it more often .
and i hope that some of these ideas were at least provocative enough for managers and bosses and business owners and organizers and people who are in charge of other people to think about laying off a little bit and giving people some more time to get some work done .
this is just a road . and it 's not very big : it 's about 250 meters on one side , 400 on the other .
there 's the nest entrance , there 's a pencil for scale .
when extra food becomes available -- and this is what everybody knows about picnics -- then extra ants are allocated to collect the food .
i don 't think that chamber has evolved because of me and my backhoe and my crew of students with pickaxes , but instead because when there 's flooding , occasionally the colony has to go down deep .
they have eyes , they can distinguish between light and dark , but they mostly work by smell .
so , if i change the numbers performing one task , it changes the numbers performing another .
and the amazing thing about this is that an ant lives only a year .
and we 've learned that , in this species -- and i suspect in others as well -- these hydrocarbons , this layer of grease on the outside of ants , is different as ants perform different tasks .
so , we do a lot of simulation and modeling , and also experimental work , to try to figure out how those two kinds of noise combine to , in the aggregate , produce the predictable behavior of ant colonies .
upon educating myself a little further about plastics , i actually realized this was a bad thing .
it 's plastic pollution .
let 's start with beatle mania : hysterical teenagers , crying , screaming , pandemonium .
students : a t-shirt . a dress .
is english a tsunami , washing away other languages ? not likely .
" they know . "
no . there 's serious issues in the region .
so with iranians , you can tell whose side the person is on based on the number of kisses they give you .
but now apparently we can 't even talk about the safest place to sit on an airplane .
so , i said , " no , no , really -- it 's penguin shit . "
and recently , i was in easter island , which is an incredibly beautiful place , and an incredibly mysterious place , because no matter where you go in easter island , you 're struck by these statues , called the moai .
but after 1,000 years out in the weather , they look like this .
so , our reactor eliminates these steps , which , if we can actually make it work , is a really cool thing .
while i was at microsoft , i took a leave of absence and went to a chef school in france .
so , the jodie foster character here is actually this woman , jill tarter , and jill has dedicated her life to this .
it 's horrible conditions , because wherever you have nice weather , plants grow , and you don 't get any erosion , and you don 't see any dinosaurs .
it 's something that can inform all sorts of science in unexpected ways .
so , there 's more and more activity near the boat , and all of a sudden somebody shouts , " what 's that in the water ? "
okay , we 'll do something with it .
bj : okay so .
the horse is sold to the first world war , and he joins up to find his horse .
we were going to test-drive it on the street outside of our house in cape town , and it got to midnight and we hadn 't done that yet .
but because they have to be light and flexible , and each one of them is different , they can 't be mass-produced , unfortunately .
or , when he 's more relaxed , the head comes down and the ears listen , either side .
you 'll notice , of course , that the puppet is made out of cane lines .
mikey brett , craig , leo , zem joaquin and basil and me .
these doctrines seemed unproven , abstract .
and it was -- the golden rule would bring them to the transcendent value that he called " ren , " human-heartedness , which was a transcendent experience in itself .
the causes of our present woes are political .
and these -- whatever our wretched beliefs -- is a religious matter , it 's a spiritual matter .
and it is often , perhaps , the very otherness of our enemies which can give us intimations of that utterly mysterious transcendence which is god .
now i 'm not in the least bit religious , neither was my father , but at that point , i noticed something happening here .
and the first was , i 'd ask other people : " do you like it ? " " yes . "
because the people i speak to in the northern hemisphere that used to go in the cinema get this .
there 's some rather bored-looking gentlemen and some slightly engaged-looking ladies who are picking up something off that .
it 's not a " this is wonderful ! "
it 's mediated by information before the comprehension .
it is really -- i mean , i can 't express to you how exquisite this object is .
and then i can 't tell you how hard it is to do that radiator , which is curved .
but then , of course , the consumer says that doesn 't really matter .
and part of the joy of it is , you know the difficulty .
we are slaves to the first few fractions of a second -- and that 's where much of my work has to win or lose , on a shelf in a shop .
and so i 've stopped using words like " form , " and i 've stopped using words like " function " as a designer .
because it is a bit of a niche market , and there 's not much work going on , especially where i 'm from .
so with all that in mind , ladies and gentlemen , i would like to take you on a journey to a completely separate part of earth as i transform the sydney opera house into a smoky downtown jazz bar .
i knew enough , that is , to know that i 'd be a tourist in the koran -- an informed one , an experienced one even , but still an outsider , an agnostic jew reading some else 's holy book .
or take the infamous verse about killing the unbelievers .
paradise is quite the opposite .
could we do something for these 93 countries ?
in burundi i walked into a prison and it wasn 't a 12-year-old boy , it was an 8-year-old boy for stealing a mobile phone .
it had everything in it . lawyers can come at the police station . it was perfect .
but the third and most important thing is that we make a commitment to this .
thank you .
and it 's not just stewardship and dominion debate , because really , dominion is implicit in stewardship -- because how could you dominate something you had killed ?
and so we call it " cradle to cradle , " and our goal is very simple .
we see that companies acting ethically in this world are outperforming those that don 't .
i went to yale for graduate school , studied in a building of this style by le corbusier , affectionately known in our business as brutalism .
because in poetics , as margaret atwood pointed out , " we write our history on the skin of fish with the blood of bears . "
so we 're asking for human artifice to become a living thing , and we want growth , we want free energy from sunlight and we want an open metabolism for chemicals .
biotechnical nutrients -- the model u for ford motor , a cradle to cradle car -- concept car .
our assignment is to develop protocols for the housing for 400 million people in 12 years .
the transportation is all very simple , everybody 's within a five-minute walk of mobility .
in the united states over the past hundred years , incomes have increased 30 times , and hundreds of thousands of people have been moved out of poverty .
instead of liberal democracy , they have de-prioritized the democratic system .
if you travel to mogadishu , mexico city or mumbai , you find that dilapidated infrastructure and logistics continue to be a stumbling block to the delivery of medicine and healthcare in the rural areas .
well , the world could look like more state involvement and state capitalism ; greater protectionisms of nation-states ; but also , as i just pointed out a moment ago , ever-declining political rights and individual rights .
today , generations are looking at china and saying , " china can produce infrastructure , china can produce economic growth , and we like that . "
but i did go on to be a reasonably astute , arguably world-class worrier .
let 's take a look .
because i know our brains are resilient .
my little boy 's right there , and he 's like , " she 's not kidding .
ask about what kind of protective equipment is available .
it was ultimately a test of our political ability to halt environmental destruction .
sometimes these carcasses also wash up on beaches and provide a meal to a number of predatory species on land .
and i 've always been nervous about the term " futurist , " because you seem doomed to failure because you can 't really predict it .
i work with a fabulous illustrator called nick dragotta .
and this is sort of babbage 's revenge .
and the whole point of going with the extremely simple rules here , and the incredibly simple state machines in the previous design , was that you don 't need digital logic to do computation .
you then put a membrane on that and you apply pressure -- so that 's part of the extra program .
i guess i 'm just going to casually tell you the types of things that i think about with this .
so maybe i 'll do that with this short video .
one is a lab that is actually a fairly high-end laboratory in africa .
so , this is an example of a device made from a simple piece of paper .
it 's something called a lateral flow immunoassay .
that takes about two seconds to make .
he was telling the truth . because in a different culture , the dog is a surrogate for you , you know , " today , " " this month , " " since the rainy season " -- there are lots of opportunities for misunderstanding , and so an issue here is to , in some cases , to figure out how to deal with matters that seem uninteresting , like compliance .
also , a fact which you may not know is that the compute capability of this thing is not so different from the compute capability of your desktop computer .
it distributes itself out into these various wells or holes , and turns color , and all done with paper and carpet tape .
it costs 50 dollars . we can probably make it for 50 cents , if we put our mind to it .
so there was a bit of a conflict there .
never has this number been so high , but actually this is good news , because what it means is people stop dying .
so you can imagine that if you are a generic company about to decide whether to invest in the development of this product , unless you know that the licenses to these patents are actually going to be available , you will probably choose to do something else .
and this is no longer fantasy .
as stephen hawking famously said , we 're just a chemical scum on the surface of a typical planet that 's in orbit around a typical star , which is on the outskirts of a typical galaxy , and so on .
and yet from intergalactic space , it 's so far away you wouldn 't even see it .
that physical objects , as unlike each other as they could possibly be , can nevertheless embody the same mathematical and causal structure and to do it more and more so over time .
in other words , it 's a matter of knowledge , not resources .
the danger is not at all unprecedented . species go extinct all the time .
and with problems that we are not aware of yet , the ability to put right -- not the sheer good luck of avoiding indefinitely -- is our only hope , not just of solving problems , but of survival .
in afghanistan , people go to extraordinary lengths to be able to watch this program .
so just by presenting herself and being in competition with men -- this shows the voting on the program -- it sets a very important example for young women -- these are young women in the audience of the program -- in abu dhabi , but also people in the viewing audience .
so , technology was sort of absent from everybody 's thinking until 1952 , which happened to be the year of my birth .
there are very few young infants because they die -- high mortality rate -- and there 's very few old people .
and fire was used to clear out , and again , affected the ecology of grass and whole continents , and was used in cooking .
it 's a very , very strong force .
and the energy density that we see in the greatest of anywhere in the universe is actually in a pc chip .
and that 's the thing that bothers most people , is that progress is really real , but we wonder and question : what are the environmental costs of it ?
when we have a bad idea , the response to a bad idea is not no ideas , it 's not to stop thinking .
so that i think technology loves biology , if we allow it to .
probably somewhere around 1,500 .
and i think we have a caller coming in here .
here 's a song we like to think of as the future anthem of ted .
so that 's why it looks maybe a little bit weird , especially to the people who deal with structures in general .
and then we are talking also about materials , synthetic biology , for example .
so imagine you have carbon nanotubes growing inside a 3d printer , and they are embedded inside a matrix of plastic , and follow the forces which occur in your component .
and a few more beers , i said , " there has to be some stuff that hasn 't come back . "
and i didn 't want to share with him the idea over the phone , so i convinced him to meet with me for coffee in melbourne in 2004 .
we 're going to have a lot of fun doing it , and it taught us the importance of taking risks and really smart risks .
and that is an amazing achievement when you think about us growing mustaches .
your mom would be so proud . "
so now we 're funding them to the tune of about five or six million dollars to collaborate and bringing them together , and that 's a unique thing in the cancer world , and we know , through that collaboration , it will accelerate outcomes .
and donors are supposed to bring peace by building schools and roads .
" because you have felt me , i can feel myself again . "
and they are working with me up to today .
and now you are helping me to regain some confidence in the future . "
and this is when the americans beat the russians , and this was -- yes , it was technically a game .
so you can look at this , and maybe you 've even seen things like this . this is an expression of culture , right ?
" can i play a game , mommy ? "
and she was fascinated by this , and she started to cry , and i started to cry , and her father started to cry , and now we 're all crying . he didn 't expect to come home from work to the middle passage , but there it goes .
and originally it was a math problem more or less .
and i 'll tell you why we need to change it , but we absolutely have to change it .
you know , it doesn 't work .
it 's consuming food in a way in which we 'll still have a planet , in which kids will grow up to be healthy , and which really tries to mitigate all the negative impacts we 're seeing .
and it 's because of what we feed them .
the only kitchen tools my staff had was a box cutter .
you know , we have to change the way we teach kids about these things .
those are the recipes that the kids learn in my cooking classes .
and we have to pull it all together . we have composting in all of our schools .
you know , if you have kids coming into lunch and all they 're going to do when they get out of lunch is go to have recess , you see them just throw away their lunch so they can run outside .
okay , finance 101 on this , and this -- i 'm sort of wrapping it up with this finance piece , because i think this is something we all have to understand .
it 's the kids who have parents and grandparents and uncles and aunts that can 't even afford to pay for school lunch that gets this food .
now as you may know , sound travels in waves , so if you have a speaker , a speaker actually does nothing else than taking the audio signal , transform it into a vibration , which is then transported through the air , is captured by our ear , and transformed into an audio signal again .
it 's got an oily consistency .
did he drink half a bottle of whiskey and then draw the hallucination he got from being drunk onto paper ?
so that 's how those images were made .
because 70 is normally the score for mental retardation .
they 'd only had , as people had in 1900 , about four years of schooling .
wherever there is always snow , the bears are white .
they were things like , why is the largest city of a state rarely the capital ?
they had to get complicated cdo-squared in order to bundle debt together and make debt look as if it were actually a profitable asset .
they would not take the hypothetical seriously , and without the hypothetical , it 's very difficult to get moral argument off the ground .
that 's what initially got me going on cognitive history .
they don 't know the korean war from the war in vietnam .
here 's an example : if i were to tell you , let 's play a little coin toss game , and i 'm going to flip a coin , and if it comes up heads , i 'm going to pay you 10 dollars , but you have to pay four dollars for the privilege of playing with me , most of you would say , sure , i 'll take that bet . because you know that the odds of you winning are one half , the gain if you do is 10 dollars , that multiplies to five , and that 's more than i 'm charging you to play . so , the answer is , yes .
the reason words with r in the third place come slowly to your mind isn 't because they 're improbable , unlikely or infrequent .
well , there are many answers , but one answer surely is , we see a lot of winners . right ? when this couple wins the lottery , or ed mcmahon shows up at your door with this giant check -- how the hell do you cash things that size , i don 't know .
i want to talk now about errors in value .
why ? because it used to cost 700 , and there 's no way i 'm paying 1,500 for something that was 700 last week .
what the hell difference should it make ?
i have to show you something from my own lab , so let me sneak this in .
it doesn 't know what you saved it on .
this is what we call a one-item iq test , ok ?
they are going to recede towards the vanishing point in the horizon , and i want you to notice two things .
well , the question with which i 'd like to end is this : if we 're so damn stupid , how did we get to the moon ?
surely that causes people to overestimate the likelihood that they 'll be hurt in these various ways , and gives power to the very people who want to frighten us .
yes , of course . so , if we knew that this was the worst attack there would ever be , there might be more and more buses of 30 people -- we would probably not be nearly so frightened .
well , you know , the people who are most skeptical about leaping to evolutionary explanations for everything are the evolutionary psychologists themselves .
but certainly i see your point : that there can be some utility to buying a lottery ticket other than winning .
i was one of the fortunate few that really did get to know him and enjoyed his presence .
how can somebody like that make you feel smart ?
when he finished the story , i said to him , " dick , i wonder what would be the difference between a feynman sandwich and a susskind sandwich . "
and this was a very , very dangerous thing to do around dick feynman .
i think the only point of similarity between us is we both like to talk about ourselves .
in fact , he had been convinced at one time that , to be a good physicist , that it was very important to have had that kind of relationship with your father .
but he also deeply believed , he truly believed , that if you couldn 't explain something simply you didn 't understand it .
it was so simple , in fact , that i suspect a really smart high school student , who didn 't even have calculus , could understand what he wrote down .
you could do a one loop diagram . don 't worry about one loop .
but how should we honor feynman ?
the explanation of that paradox is that , within our societies , we 're looking at relative income or social position , social status -- where we are in relation to each other and the size of the gaps between us .
it has 40 different components put together by other people .
so here is trust from a general social survey of the federal government related to inequality .
and the more unequal societies are more likely also to retain the death penalty .
the other really important point i want to make on this graph is that , if you look at the bottom , sweden and japan , they 're very different countries in all sorts of ways .
it goes through towards the skilled manual occupations in the middle , then the junior non-manual , going up high to the professional occupations -- doctors , lawyers , directors of larger companies .
we have an absolute rule that if our data source has data for one of the countries we 're looking at , it goes into the analysis .
suddenly we have a handle on the psychosocial well-being of whole societies , and that 's exciting .
and we should begin by reimagining leather .
and finally , we take this multilayered skin and through a shorter and much less chemical tanning process , we create leather .
imagine that in this facility , instead of brewing beer , we were brewing leather or meat .
but as this ring rotates at about 1,700 rpm -- that 's 28 times per second .
but this piece is due out in may .
now , there was a big effort to solve this problem , and there was actually a big solution .
that 's been the discoveries of the last 2,000 years , that 's mankind moving forward .
we think there 's an income problem , so we create new ways of farming that increase income .
should you increase , maintain or decrease the number of fluids ? "
and that , to me , is the fundamental challenge of the last mile .
so , let 's dial this back . that 's what ? fifth grade ? fourth grade ?
i suspect most of you -- i hope that 's true for the rest of you -- actually do pretty well with addition and subtraction in the real world .
another person walks into the lot , and they 're about to buy a hummer , nine miles per gallon , fully loaded , luxury .
bwm realizes safety , in people 's minds , has two components .
but the pain , the discomfort , you know , paying attention , remembering to put it in your purse when you go on a long trip : these are the day-to-day of life , and they do pose problems .
so , how do we tackle the last mile ?
so , this whole area is so fascinating .
the one thing that all of them have in common is that they 're going to die .
ao : yeah .
i think that 's going to become completely possible as the amount of data we 're producing and technology 's ability to understand it both expand exponentially .
so we 're bound with the laws of physics and the laws of economics .
you drive . you take your depleted battery out .
but the crude oil is replaced with a battery .
so in a sense this is an absolute zero-carbon , zero-fossil fuel electric mile at two cents a mile by 2020 .
it 's the first mass-volume electric car , zero-emission electric car in the market .
hawaii you can drive around the island on one battery .
what happens when the economy recovers ?
it 's also the most optimistic number because it means we will scale this industry from 100 thousand cars is 2011 , to 10 million cars by 2016 -- 100 x growth in less than five years .
we are looking at the emergence of a car 2.0 -- a whole new market , a whole new business model .
and when we go to cop15 at the end of this year we can 't stop thinking of padding co2 .
and after a month of arguments they decided to stop slavery , and the industrial revolution started within less than one year .
so basically what i 'd like to talk about today is a way for people to travel , to meet people in a different way than -- because you can 't travel all over the world at the same time .
so maybe me starting to take pictures was some kind of way to bring both sides of my family together , a way to take the worlds with me , a way to tell stories visually .
and i think it was at that point that i decided that i wanted to use photography and film to somehow bridge gaps , to bridge cultures , bring people together , cross borders .
to change the arab nightmare into the american dream .
it makes me hate war .
now , i 'm not a philosopher , so i feel like i shouldn 't go into great depth on this but let film speak for itself and take you to this other world .
don 't you see what you 're doing is destroying us ?
tzvika : yes , i have assistants .
and that 's what this is about .
and i believe that this one day , if we can create it , this one day can create momentum for all of these independent voices .
jn : it 's more tangible than world peace , and it 's certainly more immediate .
now the same view in 2010 .
now , collaborative consumption is creating the start of a transformation in the way we think about supply and demand , but it 's also a part of a massive value shift underway , where instead of consuming to keep up with the joneses , people are consuming to get to know the joneses .
but i love that the number one task posted , over a hundred times a day , is something that many of us have felt the pain of doing : yes , assembling ikea furniture .
well , this isn 't anything new . just think of power sellers on ebay or star ratings on amazon .
the big challenge is figuring out what data makes sense to pull , because the future 's going to be driven by a smart aggregation of reputation , not a single algorithm .
now users earn reputation in a whole range of ways , but it 's basically by convincing their peers they know what they 're talking about .
and i think , when i listen to these incredible people here , i 've been so inspired -- so many incredible ideas , so many visions .
it 's not , perhaps , the dimensions appreciated by art critics or architecture critics or city planners .
and , of course , expressive spaces are not mute .
life without emotion would really not be life .
because i believe that the hand in all its primitive , in all its physiological obscurity , has a source , though the source is unknown , though we don 't have to be mystical about it .
so again , the evasion of that sphere , which has been so endemic to that sort of pure architecture , the autonomous architecture that is just an abstract object has never appealed to me .
and of course habits are enforced by architecture .
so i 've been never interested in the forgettable reuse , rehashing of the same things over and over again , which , of course , get accolades of critics .
it should not play it safe , because if it plays it safe it 's not moving us in a direction that we want to be .
where people cannot speak , cannot vote , cannot do anything .
this is america . this is liberty .
depending on who you read , an arts organization or an artist , who tries to attract the attention of a potential single ticket buyer , now competes with between three and 5,000 different marketing messages a typical citizen sees every single day .
the arts reformation , like the religious reformation , is spurred in part by technology , with indeed , the printing press really leading the charge on the religious reformation .
they currently are the best opportunities for artists to have lives of economic dignity -- not opulence -- of dignity .
and i thank you for your kindness and your patience in listening to me this afternoon .
by 2007 : over 300 billion dollars .
now ideas have this amazing property .
now we are not there yet , but it is happening .
a large fraction of those people are in the united states .
that is something that we should embrace -- a wealthy china , a wealthy india , a wealthy africa .
what about a great depression ?
as oil prices go up , energy patents go up .
everything about flying in those years , which was -- you have to stop and think for a moment -- was probably the most advanced technological thing going on at the time .
and of course , as a model in those years , you couldn 't control it .
any of you who rode the automobiles -- was it yesterday ? -- at the track , you know the romance revolving around those high performance cars .
and i flew it .
he said she had one of the new , better chairs .
and stop where you want .
but to do that , if you have any amount of recline , it gets to the point where you need a headrest because nearly always , automatically hold your head in a vertical position , see ?
i 'm in awe of their power in terms of imagination , in terms of technology , in terms of concept .
and specifically , it 's in terms of the very intense emotional rewards that playing games offers to people both individually and collectively .
and by this , i mean looking at what millions upon millions of people have done and carefully calibrating the rate , the nature , the type , the intensity of rewards in games to keep them engaged over staggering amounts of time and effort .
fifteen is a pretty optimal number .
it 's not giving me my last two pies . i 'm going to give up .
it 's your 100 percent factor . games are brilliant at this .
and two things really flow from this .
and the success rate is at close to 100 percent .
thank you very much .
and then what happens ?
rule number eight : strength doesn 't always equal success .
" you 're always talking to nice people , except when you went to the white house . "
i love that , but we don 't have the time .
and decatur , georgia 's a small southern town .
there 's a historical marker .
issued , evidently , by the dmv in her own county of gwinnett .
i mean , i 've got a mouth as dry as the kalahari desert .
" would this guy have , like , a blue uniform and a terrified look on his face ? "
" you mean , like , in the car ? "
you want to laugh , but you don 't know -- you 're that politically corrected , have you noticed ?
this is new and fast , just so you -- are you still with us ?
don 't you want to look ?
she is , after all , cuban .
yeah , you can clap , but then you 're about 30 seconds from the end .
and i turn to esther , who 's rocking on those ' ports , and says , " you know what , honey ? "
it 's really a very precisely timed thing .
and so , if you have that gene , and you see a lot of violence in a certain situation , this is the recipe for disaster , absolute disaster .
okay , so that 's the first case of matricide .
there 's a man by the name of captain william swenson who recently was awarded the congressional medal of honor for his actions on september 8 , 2009 .
why did you do it ? "
it could be the ups and downs in the economy , the uncertainty of the stock market .
when we feel safe inside the organization , we will naturally combine our talents and our strengths and work tirelessly to face the dangers outside and seize the opportunities .
how about a $ 250 million bonus to mother teresa ?
leadership is a choice . it is not a rank .
so here 's his first follower with a crucial role ; he 's going to show everyone else how to follow .
so first , if you are the type , like the shirtless dancing guy that is standing alone , remember the importance of nurturing your first few followers as equals so it 's clearly about the movement , not you .
now god , angered at this attempt to usurp his power , destroyed the tower , and then to ensure that it would never be rebuilt , he scattered the people by giving them different languages -- confused them by giving them different languages .
these upright apes evolved on the african savanna about two million years ago , and they made these splendid hand axes that fit wonderfully into your hands .
in fact , we can even make the " stuff of life " -- as i just said , all the stuff around us .
language evolved to solve the crisis of visual theft .
and this is why our species has prospered around the world while the rest of the animals sit behind bars in zoos , languishing .
and he said to me , " oh no .
that 's something on the order of 1.45 billion u.s. dollars on translation costs alone .
do we have any idea how we could have defeated neanderthals if they also had language ?
and in fact , this is one million plastic cups , which is the number of plastic cups that are used on airline flights in the united states every six hours .
every time i look at this piece , i always wonder if my mom 's whispering to my dad , " he finally folded his laundry . "
this is just lots and lots of cigarettes : 65,000 cigarettes , which is equal to the number of teenagers who will start smoking this month , and every month in the u.s.
they 've gone missing ; these feelings have gone missing .
most of us worry about things we can 't control , like war , terrorism , the tragic earthquake that just occurred in haiti .
when they work , they can make history , but after a while you can barely hear them .
the invader draws the attention of the immune system 's front-line troops .
so , you 've got this situation : in 2003 , we had an h5n1 virus that jumped from birds into humans in a few isolated cases with an apparent mortality rate of 70 percent .
newer concepts and early testing now show even greater promise in the best of our animal models .
in the longer term , what they can do is use these tools of retro-vaccinology to make a preventive flu vaccine .
it was a slow , cumbersome process that depended on chicken eggs , millions of living chicken eggs .
here 's an example : a company i 'm engaged with has found a specific piece of the h spike of flu that sparks the immune system .
what the world needs now are these new vaccines , and we can make it happen .
it probably isn 't the perfect vaccine , but it 's moving along .
if i held up a square that was one foot square and the color of earth , and i held up another square that was the root two square -- so it 's 1.5 times bigger -- and was the color of the oceans ; and i said , what is the relative value of these two things ?
it generates all of the buoyancy , all of the payload for the craft , and the batteries are down here hanging underneath , exactly like a balloon .
and we 're only just beginning to grasp it .
so now i try and go after her , but i 'm practicing flying .
" this is an incredible encounter with a manta . i 'm speechless .
what comes next in 30 seconds ? i can 't tell you .
anjali 's father , a drunkard , sold his child for pornography .
most of them come from very optionless families , not just poor .
and one day she gives up on you and me , because we have no options for her .
why welding and why not computers ?
it 's very fashionable to talk about human trafficking , in this fantastic a-c hall .
can you just encompass these people too ?
the picture on india is the dharavi slum of mumbai in india .
country 1 has a systematic advantage over country 2 in infrastructures .
in developing countries , the most common mode of transportation is the railways , and the british built a lot of railways in india .
they have a complicated , but shared common history .
china was during the cultural revolution .
so you have to always think carefully about these decisions .
isn 't it true that the one-party political system has facilitated economic growth in china ?
so the dynamic perspective fits both with china and in india in terms of the direction .
hopefully , five years from now , i 'm going to report to tedglobal that political reforms will happen in china .
it 's just a lesion formed inside .
so this is how it looks , you know , the operating room of the future today .
i don 't have a pointer here , but you see the green , sort of rectangle or trapezoid ?
and you can see the points there on the graph .
he returned to a normal life routine .
they drove like three hours from their farm to the hospital .
they were the first to be treated by focused ultrasound .
so new life was born .
okay , that was kind of cool .
and if nasa doesn 't do it , china might , or somebody in this room might write a big check .
and i want to ask the question : how far and how fast would be have to move ?
and what it does essentially is to stimulate further consumption growth .
and in the mean time , personal savings absolutely plummeted .
well , i had my own personal insight into this a few years ago .
well psychology actually says there is a tension -- a tension between self-regarding behaviors and other regarding behaviors .
and ecosia works in pretty much the same way .
but it 's also clear that prosperity goes beyond this .
thank you very much .
if you can convince me we can do all that , then , yes , i would take the two percent .
and my father used to say at that time , " i 'm going to spread all my four daughters in four corners of the world . "
i thought i must tell you this .
i had other options , but i didn 't choose them .
i said , " do you pray ? do you want to pray ? "
that 's the second landmark .
this was a magic box .
government institutions were completely decapitated , including the presidential palace .
we wanted to communicate in a two-way form of communication .
right across the developing world , citizens and communities are using technology to enable them to bring about change , positive change , in their own communities .
and we 're seeing from all points on the globe similar stories .
and convert it to humanitarian good .
and we call that the meme-ome .
the structure starts to emerge where we see a kind of fractal behavior of the words and the language that we use to describe the things that are important to us all around this world .
but there 's so much creative content that 's just buried at the bottom .
sg : so that 's exactly right .
so i created this image of diana , dodi and their imaginary mixed-race child and this image came out , which caused a huge public outcry at the time .
which i found very interesting that it was going full cycle : i was making comments about the press and about how we know facts and information only by media -- because we don 't know the real people ; very few of us know the real people -- but it was going back into the press and they were publicizing , effectively , my filthy work .
she looks nothing like marilyn , but by the time we 've made her up and put wigs and makeup on , she looks exactly like marilyn , to the extent that her husband couldn 't recognize her -- or recognize this look-alike -- in these photographs , which i find quite interesting .
but it was a difficulty for me -- because this is my artwork ; should i do advertising ? -- at the time .
this image , for example , is sort of spot-on because it exactly sums up what elton may be doing in private , and also what might be happening with saddam hussein , and george bush reading the koran upside-down .
but it slightly bores me .
it wasn 't a baseball player ; it was linus pauling .
and there i met francis crick .
if dna is that important , linus will know it .
and so i came back with that news to cambridge , and bragg said , " build models . "
it 's the order of the four bases .
but that 's the only -- no , we were only photographed twice .
and what you can do is sort of compare dna of normal segs versus cancer .
now , so , our autism study is just beginning . we got three million dollars .
those learning it think it 's disconnected , uninteresting and hard .
what 's the point of teaching people math ?
and also verify it -- crucial step .
that 's an amazing amount of human endeavor .
well one of them is , they say , you need to get the basics first .
if you were born after computers and paper , it doesn 't really matter which order you 're taught with them in , you just want to have the best tool .
they 've got hair all over them .
what i really think we gain from this is students getting intuition and experience in far greater quantities than they 've ever got before .
in the end , if we test everyone by hand in exams , it 's kind of hard to get the curricula changed to a point where they can use computers during the semesters .
now i 'm not even sure if we should brand the subject as math , but what i am sure is it 's the mainstream subject of the future .
this is old information we 've known since about the 80s , yet there 's no medicine i can prescribe to a patient with this or any of the numerous solid tumors caused by these three horsemen of the apocalypse that is cancer .
now not being a drug company , we could do certain things , we had certain flexibilities , that i respect that a pharmaceutical industry doesn 't have .
well that would be impossible and , rightly , illegal to do in humans .
but the science that 's coming back from all of these laboratories about the use of this molecule has provided us insights that we might not have had on our own .
i want to leave you with just two ideas .
and maybe the hardest thing of all is to figure out that what other people think and feel isn 't actually exactly like what we think and feel .
and the remarkable thing was that 18 month-old babies , just barely walking and talking , would give her the crackers if she liked the crackers , but they would give her the broccoli if she liked the broccoli .
on the other hand , we have our friend the domestic chicken .
and that one big disadvantage is that , until you actually do all that learning , you 're going to be helpless .
then they test that new hypothesis and so on and so forth .
so we did just this ; we gave four year-olds this pattern of evidence , and we just asked them to make it go .
boy : what 's making this light up .
well , what 's it like to be this kind of creature ?
well if we want to think about a way of getting a taste of that kind of baby consciousness as adults , i think the best thing is think about cases where we 're put in a new situation that we 've never been in before -- when we fall in love with someone new , or when we 're in a new city for the first time .
the thing about their work is that most people come to the door of furniture -- i suspect you probably recognize this chair and some of the others i 'm going to show you .
the nixon-khrushchev kitchen debate happened about 50 feet from where this was shown .
so those are cool images . but these are ones i think are really cool .
this is a relatively famous chair .
they tried to solve the design problem .
modeling , they tried modeling all the time . they were always modeling things .
so can you read it ?
it 's kind of a reinterpretation of the landscape .
a guy named nobu naga , the so-called japanese columbus .
so we 're going to do the last clip .
and it 's kind of cool for me to be part of a family and a tradition where he was talking about that in 1978 .
the best way to visualize an electric field is to think of gravity .
and it prevents them from forming those chains , those mitotic spindles , that are necessary to pull the genetic material into the daughter cells .
10 years ago , dr. palti founded a company called novocure to develop his discovery into a practical therapy for patients .
he won the gold medal in moscow in the 4,000 meter pursuit .
it doesn 't interfere with computers or electrical equipment .
her cancer continued to grow .
yves uses his body to steer the wing .
commentator two : and what he 's going to do as he approaches the ground is pull down on those toggles to flare , slow himself down just a little bit , and then come in for a nice landing .
and that 's the nearest thing to the dream .
it 's not steering , it 's flight .
i know i have about eight minutes fuel .
so i was at my minimum altitude in that vector -- fast -- so i pulled that .
in a fighter , you have an ejection seat .
yr : i have a standard answer .
this is coming from the heart of finance .
this paradox is what got me interested in complex systems .
this is quite remarkable , because , again , why did no one look at this before ?
this is a lot of data , and because we wanted to find out who rules the world , we decided to focus on transnational corporations , or tncs for short .
now what we actually computed in our study was the control over the tncs ' value .
it 's not a street map . "
and i kept on staring at it until it disappeared .
you know , there is a fear of dying , and do not believe any movie character where the hero is not afraid .
or , as we speak now , hundreds of thousands of congolese women are getting raped and mutilated .
there is a side that leads the front-line discussion , and there is a side that leads the back-line discussion .
and last , but not least , we need to invest in peace and women , not only because it is the right thing to do , not only because it is the right thing to do , for all of us to build sustainable and lasting peace today , but it is for the future .
ideas , language , even the phrase ' each other ' no longer makes any sense . "
so if you look at the green data points , which is air that 's outside , you 'll see that there 's a large amount of microbial diversity , or variety of microbial types .
and for this reason , many people eat probiotic yogurt so they can promote a healthy gut flora .
so today i want to talk about how we can help all teachers get the tools for improvement they want and deserve .
in fact , there are teachers throughout the country who are helping their students make extraordinary gains .
i am a high school english teacher at johnston high school in johnston , iowa .
alrighty , everybody , have a great weekend .
i hope you are too .
and those are titan and enceladus . titan is saturn 's largest moon , and , until cassini had arrived there , was the largest single expanse of unexplored terrain that we had remaining in our solar system .
and for us , it has been like -- the cassini people -- it has been like a jules verne adventure come true .
it was a moving demonstration of what the words " united nations " are supposed to mean : a true union of nations joined together in a colossal effort for good .
and then finally , the probe came to rest on the surface , and i 'm going to show you , ladies and gentlemen , the first picture ever taken from the surface of a moon in the outer solar system .
and i think you would agree that we have found titan is a remarkable , mystical place . it 's exotic , it 's alien , but yet strangely earth-like , and having earth-like geological formations and a tremendous geographical diversity , and is a fascinating world whose only rival in the solar system for complexity and richness is the earth itself .
it was the first time that earth was imaged from space , and it had an enormous impact on our sense of place in the universe , and our sense of responsibility for the protection of our own planet .
then i 'm very much of the united states , and i have been for 48 years now , since i was a really small child .
my home would have to be whatever i carried around inside me .
so they become friends . they fall in love .
several lifetimes , actually .
i didn 't consult the monks for guidance .
but then i started thinking about my family .
and then you have something like this , which is interplast .
i like music , and i like banjos , and i think i probably heard steve martin playing , and i said , " i could do that . "
i don 't want to write for this public audience .
so odin was documented every single day .
millions and hundreds of millions and billions of people .
this is the only picture i have . and to think of what we have the ability to do with our blogs ; to think about the people who are on those $ 100 computers talking about who they are , sharing these personal stories -- this is an amazing thing .
she was writing and writing and writing , and we all started reading it , because we had so few blogs on the service , we could keep track of everyone .
in " all shook up , " a touch is not a touch , but a chill .
metaphor is not just the detection of patterns ; it is the creation of patterns .
this is the stroop test .
and they had those expectations because agent metaphors imply the deliberate action of a living thing pursuing a goal .
now metaphor is ubiquitous , yet it 's hidden .
oh , man . um , yes .
this is from their actual book .
monkeys , chimps , just get rid of the hairy creatures . "
djabran fluctus .
witness please , eugene shoemaker , who , diligently , from a young boy decided he wanted to make maps of celestial bodies .
he was also famous for having no body .
but what they 're seeing , way out there in the far reaches of the microwave background , is this kind of odd undulation .
once again , nicaragua let me down .
once again , that 's sierra leone .
and i wonder if the photographer said , " okay , jude , could you touch your tooth ? that 's good . "
they are the nodes on the string , patterns and relationships , 27 , 37 .
look at that ! i mean you cannot make that stuff up .
i start looking at that , and look at them again .
some people don 't . and if we like them , we 've got to decide what we want to do on these goals going forward .
well , as we gather here in edinburgh , technocrats appointed by the u.n. and certain governments , with the best intentions , are busying themselves designing a new package of goals , and currently they 're doing that through pretty much the same old late-20th-century , top-down , elite , closed process .
this is some of the most exciting stuff in development and democracy , where citizens on the edge of a network are helping to force open the process to make sure that the big global aid promises and vague stuff up at the top really delivers for people at a grassroots level and inverts that pyramid .
you just put up , just as one of your numbers there , that 5,000 -- is that the number ?
stories that offer transformation , that lean into transcendence , but that are never sentimental , that never look away from the darkest things about us .
this is how english my mother is -- or was , she just passed .
it takes her one year , through refugee camp after refugee camp , to make her way to an airstrip where we can fly out of the country .
all of this to say , that despite the horror , and despite the death , women are never really counted .
and then afterwards he said to me , " it will always be difficult , but if you cry like this every time , you will die of heartbreak .
he was obsessed .
every day , all of us here , we 're building gods that have gone rampant , and it 's time we started knocking them down and forgetting their names .
that 's what you 'd call a social news website .
we changed our logo , for the day , from the alien to a splashy , to sort of help the cause .
they sell mister splashy pants shirts and pins .
thank you .
in my work with cattle , i noticed a lot of little things that most people don 't notice would make the cattle balk . like , for example , this flag waving , right in front of the veterinary facility .
ok , how about famous ones ?
this is tensor imaging .
and i came in half an hour beforehand so i could have it put on and kind of get used to it , and they got it bent so it 's not hitting my chin .
when i 'm out troubleshooting equipment or problems with something in a plant , they don 't seem to be able to figure out , " do i have a training people issue ?
white cowboy hats , that was absolutely fine .
and the dementia ate out the language parts of the brain , and then this artwork came out of somebody who used to install stereos in cars .
let 's get him working on building different things .
another thing that can be very , very , very successful is there is a lot of people that may have retired from working in the software industry , and they can teach your kid .
but if there is someone here who has an autistic child , or knows an autistic child and feels kind of cut off from them , what advice would you give them ?
you directly observe a few simple things .
and the colors here represent the motivation behind the money .
and when you 're lost in information , an information map is kind of useful .
if we look closer , we see those peaks occur at the same month every year .
let me show you this .
but i wanted to convey something to you .
and then you have poor old taste , which is like barely the throughput of a pocket calculator .
in fact , it 's so massively rich that it can contain the four other top industrialized nations ' economies inside itself , it 's so vastly rich .
take a look at this one .
so let 's filter that out .
so that 's what 's exciting to me , seeing how data can change my perspective and change my mind midstream -- beautiful , lovely data .
from just an idea that sounded crazy , you have the largest encyclopedia in the world .
platforms like youtube , twitter , facebook were helping us a lot because it basically gave us the impression that , " wow , i 'm not alone .
but people did not relate to this .
people were making fun of the idea .
thank god i announced the locations and everything .
and that was a personal belief , regardless of what 's going on , regardless of the details .
and so , really , so much of what we do in medicine and life in general is focused on mopping up the floor without also turning off the faucet .
these minor changes in blockages caused a 300 percent improvement in blood flow , and using cardiac positron emission tomography , or " pet , " scans , blue and black is no blood flow , orange and white is maximal .
i like this slide , because it 's a chance to talk about what really motivates people to change , and what doesn 't .
but when you change those behaviors , your brain gets more blood , you think more clearly , you have more energy , your heart gets more blood in ways i 've shown you .
the other way is to change the type of food .
if you don 't remember anything else from this talk , three grams a day of fish oil can reduce your risk of a heart attack and sudden death by 50 to 80 percent .
now , there are ecological reasons for eating lower on the food chain too , whether it 's the deforestation of the amazon , or making more protein available , to the four billion people who live on a dollar a day -- not to mention whatever ethical concerns people have .
now , on the other hand , anything that promotes intimacy is healing .
as humans , it 's in our nature to want to improve our health and minimize our suffering .
and what i want to show you is that in regenerative medicine , we 've really shifted away from that idea of taking a bioinert material .
but the problem is , there 's only so much you can take , and also when you do that operation , your patients might actually have significant pain in that defect site even two years after the operation .
and you can grow different amounts of bone depending on how much gel you put in there , so it really is an on demand sort of procedure .
one other thing i want to quickly mention is that many of the scaffolds we make are porous , and they have to be , because you want blood vessels to grow in there .
do we care about those four billion people whose income levels are less than two dollars a day , the so-called bottom of the pyramid ?
yes , i went barefoot until i was 12 .
let me tell you a bit about it .
100 vendors were co-located adjacent to the plant , and innovative business models for automobile dealerships were developed .
this is why you started actually a new paradigm shift , where the same people who could not dream of sitting in a car , who were carrying their entire family in a scooter , started dreaming of being in a car .
more importantly , they not only walk far to work , and not only do they cycle to work , but they cycle for work , as you can see here .
so that 's what it is all about .
the cost of treatment , 20,000 dollars .
i launched a big program [ unclear ] csir about nine years ago .
you 're not talking exclusive innovation .
i 've still one and a half to go .
and then he said , " this is the focal length . "
i 'm trying to build a global team , which will look at the global grand challenges that the world is facing .
let me give you a quick reminder of something that you 've long forgotten .
now , many events can be subject to either construal , kind of like the classic figure-ground reversal illusions , in which you can either pay attention to the particular object , in which case the space around it recedes from attention , or you can see the faces in the empty space , in which case the object recedes out of consciousness .
for example , this construction , the dative , is used not only to transfer things , but also for the metaphorical transfer of ideas , as when we say , " she told a story to me " or " told me a story , " " max taught spanish to the students " or " taught the students spanish . "
and he says , " i was just thinking that maybe we could take care of it here in fargo , " which everyone , including the audience , interprets as a veiled bribe .
in the workplace , for example , there 's often a tension over whether an employee can socialize with the boss , or refer to him or her on a first-name basis .
on the other hand , if you extend the bribe , if the officer is dishonest , you get a huge payoff of going free .
now , bluefin were revered by man for all of human history .
they were voted on and rejected just two weeks ago , despite outstanding science that shows from two committees this fish meets the criteria of cites i.
we 're putting them together in unusual ways , and this is taking us into the ocean realm like never before .
and when i see that tuna -- this is my favorite view -- i begin to wonder : how did this fish solve the longitude problem before we did ?
this tag rides on the tuna , senses the environment around the tuna and actually will come off the fish , detach , float to the surface and send back to earth-orbiting satellites position data estimated by math on the tag , pressure data and temperature data .
astronomically , we 're calculating positions .
and that shark leaping there , if you look carefully , has an antenna .
and then there 's scott shaffer and our shearwaters wearing tuna tags , light-based tags , that now are going to take you from new zealand to monterey and back , journeys of 35,000 nautical miles we had never seen before .
and now with google 's oceans , we can actually put a white shark in that ocean .
what i 'm going to do , in the spirit of collaborative creativity , is simply repeat many of the points that the three people before me have already made , but do them -- this is called " creative collaboration ; " it 's actually called " borrowing " -- but do it through a particular perspective , and that is to ask about the role of users and consumers in this emerging world of collaborative creativity that jimmy and others have talked about .
they can say " yes " or " no " to the invention .
it will be worked out in use , in collaboration with users .
they work at their leisure , if you like .
this is new ; this is traditional .
those were the two places .
and those organizational models , it turns out , are incredibly powerful , and the people who can understand them will be very , very successful .
that costs about 100 dollars .
now , the human part related to animals : look at the left side of that .
our school systems are very flawed and do not reward you for the things that are important in life or for the survival of civilization ; they reward you for a lot of learning and sopping up stuff .
in 1981 , it flew 163 miles from paris to england , solely on the power of sunbeams , and established a basis for the pathfinder .
matt keenan : it 's switched on .
ok .
and that time when this is happening is not 100 years or 500 years .
people are living longer and societies are getting grayer .
but the more we learn about aging , the clearer it becomes that a sweeping downward course is grossly inaccurate .
and every time we paged them we 'd ask them to answer several questions -- on a one to seven scale , how happy are you right now ?
we 've said , could it be that positive emotions are simply easier to process than negative emotions , and so you switch to the positive emotions ?
but that same shift in perspective leads us to have less tolerance than ever for injustice .
when i was growing up in the ' 70s , the typical american spent one tenth of their income , american family , on transportation .
actually , oregonians spend more on alcohol than most other states , which may be a good thing or a bad thing , but it makes you glad they 're driving less .
do you live in a more walkable city or do you live in a less walkable city , or where in your city do you live ?
do you know where it 's three per 100,000 ?
until some economists said , you know , is that the right way to measure co2 ?
you don 't want to tell americans , god forbid , that they have to change their lifestyle .
i 'll try to spin a story about energy , and oil 's a convenient starting place .
now , it 's about 35 percent .
it 's about 400 million years old .
how the molecules are put together .
areca palm is a plant which removes co2 and converts it into oxygen .
40 percent of the world 's energy is taken up by buildings currently , and 60 percent of the world 's population will be living in buildings in cities with a population of over one million in the next 15 years .
" i 'm trying to go places . "
can you say ' i will kill you in the name of allah ? ' " " i could say that , but what if i were to say , ' hello . i 'm your doctor ? ' " they go , " great . and then you hijack the hospital . "
" i didn 't get the memo . what 's going on ? "
for example , dubai -- cool place .
and when you put your two year-old on a slide in the united states , they put something on the slide to slow the kid down as he comes down the slide .
he goes , " i thought you were my driver . "
but he actually talks to , has two-way exchanges with , about four to six people on a regular base , depending on his gender .
and i heard this story the first time a couple of years ago from a very modest family of immigrants from kosovo in switzerland .
and this has become such a norm of our professional lives , such a norm and such an expectation .
so the lower the status of the job and of the person carrying out , the more removed he would be from his personal sphere .
i know that seems ludicrous .
we 're going to do this one more time .
you should be immune .
yep , this cancer is your wakeup call . "
meaning can be quiet and introverted .
it 's never too late to become someone other than simply a survivor .
and at that point , her two daughters got up and said , " we 're going to go get coffee . "
we have to let that crucified self die so that a new self , a truer self , is born .
so i 've decided to recruit some of my ted friends to read my words aloud for me .
there was no particular day when anyone told me i would never speak again ; it just sort of became obvious .
does that create a separation or a distance from one person to the next ?
these are a few of the comments i recorded for use when chaz and i appeared on the oprah winfrey program .
the flow isn 't natural .
the initials stood for programmed logic for automated teaching operations .
it is unimaginable what will happen next .
ironic that my legs are fine , and it 's my shoulders that slow up my walk .
all of these people are saying , in one way or another , that what you see is not all you get .
okay , just a moment .
and the way we 'll make energy in the future is not from resource , it 's really from knowledge .
so , uranium , which is very big , wants to split .
well , there is a trickiness that you have to make it 150 million degrees , but there is a trickiness about the reaction yet .
the big thing , on the right , is the lithium we have in the world .
we 've got to take that , we 've got to make that into a fusion reactor .
but this is what we 're aiming at , sometime in the 2030s -- real electric power from fusion . thank you very much .
but you know what ?
these laws ensure that people living with hiv and those at greatest risk are protected from violence and discrimination and that they get access to prevention and to treatment .
hilma : i found out when i went to the hospital for a pregnancy check-up .
now there are still many problems .
australia and switzerland were two countries which introduced harm reduction very early on in their hiv epidemics , and they have a very low rate of hiv among injecting drug users .
but awareness needs action .
and so three days later , driving very fast , i found myself stalking a single type of giant cloud called the super cell , capable of producing grapefruit-size hail and spectacular tornadoes , although only two percent actually do .
and a lot of times that 's what people think i do , and it 's the furthest thing from it . what happens , though , is people say to me , " i don 't need any motivation . "
because that 's what i got hired to do .
so , the question we 've got to ask ourselves really is , what is it ?
and you correct me if i 'm wrong .
is this the end or the beginning ? is god punishing me or rewarding me , or is this the roll of the dice ?
we all have had time .
let me tell you what they are . first one : certainty .
zero to 10 . how high ? 10 . how certain am i that you 're going to respond to me ? 10 . how much uncertainty ?
because we all know , corny as it sounds , the secret to living is giving . we all know life 's not about me ; it 's about we . this culture knows that . this room knows that .
so , finally -- and i 'm about out of time -- the target that shapes you -- here 's what 's different about people . we have the same needs , but are you a certainty freak ? is that what you value most , or uncertainty ? this man here couldn 't be a certainty freak if he climbed through those caves . are you driven by significance or love ? we all need all six , but whatever your lead system is , tilts you in a different direction .
he said , " i don 't know how to tell you this , but you gave me the greatest gift because i 'm going to die . "
that 's a bit lofty ; i 'm really more of something like a street walker .
and so i look at this bike as not being a designer bike , but being a very good example of design .
it takes your attention ; it has a great amount of emotion ; it stares back at you the way that a figure might .
and this is a great protection of a pedestrian zone , and the repurposing of some colonial cannons to do that .
i was at the art show in miami in december , and spent a couple of hours looking at fine art , and amazed at the prices of art and how expensive it is , but having a great time looking at it .
and the idea that a city group can maintain different types of foliage is really quite exceptional .
we just got a grant from the gordon and betty moore foundation to sequence 130 genomes this year , as a side project from environmental organisms .
some of these make logical sense , in terms of different temperature gradients .
but it has roughly 500 genes .
and i think it 's important to keep reality in mind , versus what happens with people 's imaginations .
it 's truly stunning that these organisms can do that , and we probably have thousands , if not tens of thousands , of different species on this planet that are capable of doing that .
every major religion participated in this .
and since we know where their heads are , and we have a wireless mic on them that we 're processing the sound from , we 're able to create visualizations which are linked very tightly to what they 're doing with their speech .
and definitely my life has been part of that .
and then this led to broader ideas of buildings that come together through the multiplicity of systems .
and then the broader ideas of city-making start having direct influences on architecture , on the elements that make up the broader scheme , the buildings themselves , and start guiding us .
and then , again , the building itself , middle of los angeles , right across from city hall .
there 's some air conditioning left in the base , but the skin now moves on hydraulics .
and , of course , we 're interested in participating with education .
and the building is no longer seen as an autonomous thing , but something that 's only inextricably connected to this city and this place at this time .
and then of course , this one , our governor at the moment .
so , in all of these examples , structure is the determining force .
now , typically you 'd think that they would all be the same : like , the chairs you 're sitting in would all be the same dimension .
you just need to incorporate a certain number of traits in a very kind of genetic way .
so , the first kind of test product we did was with alessi , which was for a coffee and tea set .
i work with a group of other architects .
and i can -- in 15 minutes , i think i can touch only a very rather janitorial branch of creation , which i call " creativity . "
and another point -- why i 'm here -- is that the day i went to pick up the plexiglas trophy , i rented a tuxedo for the first time in my life , picked the thing -- didn 't have any friends .
they lived in brazil , long time ago .
and he did something that was very tricky .
and i don 't know how many yards , after john constable .
and you render this with the most non-specific material , which is dust itself .
now i would do very small ones , which would be like -- but under the same light , and i would show them together , so the viewer would have to really figure it out what one he was looking .
my time is nearly up .
and i 'm going to tell you that story here in a moment .
so that 's when i first learned of the islands and had no idea what i was getting into .
the phoenix islands and all the equatorial parts of our planet are very important for tuna fisheries , especially this yellowfin tuna that you see here .
and it reminded me of that old joke where the bank robber comes out of the courthouse handcuffed , and the reporter yells , " hey , willy . why do you rob banks ? "
so i said , " okay , i 'm happy to buy lunch .
there were no oceanic deals where countries were compensated for not fishing .
so suddenly we had this area that we were protecting , but now it appeared to be dead , at least in the coral areas .
but i would say the most important one in my mind was working within the market forces of the situation .
what 's interesting , in conversations with the founder , dave isay , we always actually talked about this as a little bit of a subversive project , because when you think about it , it 's actually not really about the stories that are being told , it 's about listening , and it 's about the questions that you get to ask , questions that you may not have permission to on any other day .
and gallery one is an interesting project because it started with this massive , $ 350 million expansion for the cleveland museum of art , and we actually brought in this piece specifically to grow new capacity , new audiences , at the same time that the museum itself is growing .
and you can see from these images , the site is so raw and almost archaeological .
voice 5 : i was in times square . voice 6 : são paolo , brazil .
and so these are questions like , " how can a democracy balance freedom and security ? "
in this case , harry ramos , who was the head trader at an investment bank , who stopped to aid victor wald on the 55th floor of the south tower .
and get this -- you 'll have an eight-week vacation of doing absolutely nothing .
i 'm not sure you 'd want it .
and that it wasn 't until 2009 , when president obama signed off on a surge , that we finally had , in the words of secretary clinton , " the strategy , the leadership and the resources . "
in sangin where i was sick in 2002 , the nearest health clinic was within three days walk .
it 's not ; it 's a wonderful place full of incredible energy and intelligence .
or in 2009 , my great friend , general stanley mcchrystal , who said that he was " knee-deep in the decisive year . "
in the british embassy in afghanistan in 2008 , an embassy of 350 people , there were only three people who could speak dari , the main language of afghanistan , at a decent level .
but you need to look at context .
you understand that you can prepare , but the amount of preparation you can do is limited -- you can take some water , you can have a map , you can have a pack .
we put our toes in and we go up to our neck .
and we called it a studio school to go back to the original idea of a studio in the renaissance where work and learning are integrated .
interestingly , it 's happened almost entirely without media coverage .
all right .
and this is an interesting story .
and what happened , of course , is we ended up with a whole bunch of different dinosaurs .
you go into a museum and they take really good care of them .
and we want to look at these three first .
dracorex is the littlest one , stygimoloch is the middle size one , pachycephalosaurus is the largest one .
there 's a triceratops in every museum in the world , but no one had ever collected a juvenile .
but there 's another dinosaur that is found in this formation that looks like a triceratops , except it 's bigger , and it 's called torosaurus .
and we get rid of anatotitan .
now as you can imagine , this is not very popular with fourth-graders .
now , that early universe was incredibly dense , like a metal , way denser , and if you hit it , it would ring , but the thing ringing would be the structure of space-time itself , and the hammer would be quantum mechanics .
and what i 've found is that the process of designing and building electronics is problematic in all sorts of ways .
this man is wearing what we call a bee beard .
the way that urban beekeeping currently operates is that the beehives are quite hidden , and it 's not because they need to be .
the bees in boston on the rooftop of the seaport hotel , where we have hundreds of thousands of bees flying overheard right now that i 'm sure none of you noticed when we walked by , are going to all of the local community gardens and making delicious , healthy honey that just tastes like the flowers in our city .
think of the kids today . their childhood 's a bit different .
and i 'm still pricking bees . "
we have also some images of honey from brooklyn .
and a was lost by an italian humanist in 1564 .
it got in worse condition in the 20th century after heiberg saw it .
now if you 're a conservator , you can take off this glue reasonably easily .
and the image on the left is the normal red image .
it sheds an x-ray .
and this is a perfect square , and it 's divided into 14 bits .
it was such a great speech that the athenian law courts let him off .
because the web of the ancient manuscripts of the future isn 't going to be built by institutions .
thank you very much indeed .
so i came up with a new art project called seeker .
we bought some second-hand caravans , cut them open , and reassembled them into a starship .
i think all of us have been interested , at one time or another , in the romantic mysteries of all those societies that collapsed , such as the classic maya in the yucatan , the easter islanders , the anasazi , fertile crescent society , angor wat , great zimbabwe and so on . and within the last decade or two , archaeologists have shown us that there were environmental problems underlying many of these past collapses .
going through the same checklist : human environmental impacts ?
didn 't they see what they were doing ? how could societies not perceive their impacts on the environments and stop in time ?
the big problems facing the world today are not at all things beyond our control . our biggest threat is not an asteroid about to crash into us , something we can do nothing about .
and this is the way i saw the ocean at school -- as if to say , " all geography and science lessons stop at water 's edge .
it 's just incredible ; no hollywood designer could come up with something more interesting than that .
he shoots out these sticky webs to entangle his enemy .
i didn 't want to go with this ruthless predator image .
he goes down and he meets this famous anglerfish .
and i felt like , since my main character was a shark , the comic strip was a perfect vehicle for telling the public about this .
and he clicks the " buy now " button .
and they turn up the lights .
technology is increasing at a comparable rate .
a metaphor will serve here : where elite mathematicians and statisticians and theorists often serve as architects in the expanding realm of science , the remaining large majority of basic applied scientists , including a large portion of those who could be said to be of the first rank , are the ones who map the terrain , they scout the frontiers , they cut the pathways , they raise the buildings along the way .
if that step proves too difficult for the person or team that made the discovery , a mathematician can then be added by them as a collaborator .
when the subject is still very thinly populated , you can with diligence and hard work become the world authority .
you have chosen a calling that will come in steps to give you satisfaction , at its conclusion , of a life well lived .
to me , this was a little like trying to understand the magnificence of beethoven 's fifth symphony by abstracting the sound of a single violin player out of the context of the orchestra and hearing just that one part .
coming up is the sound of a woodpecker .
the good news is that , with a little bit of habitat restoration and fewer flights , the frog populations , once diminishing during the 1980s and early ' 90s , have pretty much returned to normal .
we call ourselves pors and rao , and we live and work in india .
and as soon as it 's silent , they sort of creep out .
how would it be possible to experience a sense of invisibility ?
because if that circle weren 't there , and the floor was very even , it would start to wander about in the space .
so we work with a lot of technology , but we don 't really love technology , because it gives us a lot of pain in our work over years and years .
the west has given debt forgiveness programs which have halved sub-saharan debt from about 70 percent of gdp down to about 40 .
and they 're investing in telecoms , shopping malls .
today , sub-sahara is at the levels that turkey and mexico were at in 1975 .

it is going to extend its legs out .
so let 's look at the controller .
when we think of brain , we of course imagine our own brain .
but i would argue that flies do more .
but let 's think about this . how can you make a small number of neurons do a lot ?
well , for many years in my laboratory and other laboratories around the world , we 've been studying fly behaviors in little flight simulators .

so vanderbilt ran a study asking people , we 'd like to take your biosamples , your blood , and share them in a biobank , and only five percent of the people opted out .
and if you 'd like to build corporate structures on top of it , that 's okay too . that 's all in the consent , so if you don 't like those terms , you don 't come in .
and i feel like this whole evening has been very amazing to me .
with all of us knowing everything , we 're kind of forced by technology to become buddhas or something , to become enlightened .
how awful ! i 'm so miserable on my own . my head is aching .
i think the dalai lama should have heard that . i wish he 'd been there to hear that .
it 's really lovely .
we all know which side of these we 'd like to be on .
he said , " we have lived in this world where little things are done for love and big things for money .
the third category is represented by warren buffet , which i call aggregated giving .
so we can look to these innovators to help us remember that if we can leverage even a small amount of the capital that seeks a return , the good that can be driven could be astonishing .
our future doesn 't have to be imagined .
you could feel secure even if you 're not .
now people have a natural intuition about these trade-offs .
now there are several biases in risk perception .
because by definition , news is something that almost never happens .
if economics , if the market , drives security , and if people make trade-offs based on the feeling of security , then the smart thing for companies to do for the economic incentives are to make people feel secure .
i have feeling and reality .
the tracker i was with grew up in kruger national park .
for us , we 're very facile around electricity .
this kind of thing happens a lot .
if they equal your feelings , you don 't even know you have a model .
i mean , this works as long as it 's to correct others .
so we might have -- for the first time in our species -- feeling chases model , model chases reality , reality 's moving -- they might never catch up .
i said , " well , that 's kind of neat .
i wanted a place that i would have total silence and total solitude .
you see there are different lines : you choose in your own tempo in your own way to follow the line , but you must respect it , more or less .
and i 'm going to only talk about the mass .
it depends only on the mass of the object .
there are big ones . there are little ones .
nonetheless , it 's given rise to the notion that maybe it 's not just these prima donnas that have these supermassive black holes , but rather all galaxies might harbor these supermassive black holes at their centers .
and if i know the scale of the orbit i know the radius .
with this technology all of a sudden you can see it .
so , there was actually lots of alternatives to the idea that there was a supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy , because you could put a lot of stuff in there .
to get a star to form , you need a big ball of gas and dust to collapse .
we do this by shooting a laser up into the atmosphere , and what we think we can do is if we shine a few more that we can correct the rest .
this is ted .
this is ted , and i want to talk about design .
as long as you inform your children about other religions , then you may -- and as early as you like and whatever you like -- teach them whatever creed you want them to learn .
all i 'm saying is -- facts . facts only .
the only cost in most flocks is a loss of free mating .
well , it 's because its brain had been infected with a lancet fluke that was -- needed to get into the belly of a sheep or a cow in order to reproduce .
now , i talked to paul afterwards .
they 'd want to know how it originated , what it was for and how it perpetuates itself .
" the heart of worship is surrender .
just exactly what al is trying to do , rick is doing .
but i wish it were better .
i 'm not happy with that sentiment at all .
there might be some way of treating that as true .
that 's the devil speaking . "
welcome . if i could have the first slide , please ?
they have way too many motions for their joints , too many muscles .
that 's enough !
this is a death 's head cockroach . this is an american cockroach you think you don 't have in your kitchen .
it has the middle leg moving in synchrony with the front , and the hind leg on the other side . sort of an alternating tripod , and they can negotiate obstacles just like the animal .
here 's the gecko running up a vertical surface . there it goes , in real time . there it goes again . obviously , we have to slow this down a little bit .
what does the animal do ? the animal has weird toes .
how do they do it then ? believe it or not , they grab on by intermolecular forces , by van der waals forces .
and over there i experienced other people 's suffering , up close and personal , immersed myself in some rather intense and emotional stories , and at times i experienced great fear for my own life .
how do you live with yourself if you know you 've committed horrific crimes ?
liberia has been devastated by one of africa 's bloodiest civil wars , which has left more than 200,000 people dead , thousands of women scarred by rape and crime on a spectacular scale .
something amazing happened during this shoot .
and i 've had very serious doubt about its efficacy , and my own faith in humanity .
and that distance and knowing that amount of light is important because it 's a little like you or i sitting around a campfire : you want to be close enough to the campfire so that you 're warm , but not so close that you 're too toasty and you get burned .
while it 's kepler the telescope , the instrument that stares , it 's we , life , who are searching .
from gando , my home village in burkina faso , to berlin in germany to become an architect is a big , big step .
and then you have this result , very fine , like a baby bottom .
and we kept building , and that is the result .
another factor in gando is rain .
but the reason why i do what i do is my community .
as soon as the door closed ...
they did not make it to university .
let me ask you a few questions to see if this is a good choice . "
so i grew up in a family of women .
and in today 's world , being useful , affordable and accessible is not necessarily what happens in a lot of the technology that is done today .
those of you who 've never looked at their website , you should look at it . it 's really impressive . and you can see how the internet penetration has changed over the years .
it is an initiative that is focused on simple , accessible and human-centric solutions .
and to be able to meet the needs of this rather complex educational system , it could only be done from inside .
it 's a highly focused product aimed at strictly the education market , not only in the developing countries , but actually in the developed regions as well , because there are parts of the united states where this can have also a huge impact on the ability to make education more fun and more efficient .
thank you very much .
and we need to think about planning a little bit .
this is not the stomping ground of our pleistocene ancestors .
there is going to be a big shift towards preventative medicine as we start to be able to identify all of the risk factors that we have as individuals .
a generation or so away there are going to be even more profound things that are going to happen .
the first is cloning .
now not everything that can be done should be done .
and i think it 's wonderful that we do .
i just formed a biotechnology company that is using this sort of an approach to develop therapeutics for alzheimer 's and other diseases of aging , and we 're making some real progress .
and what 's extraordinary is that we 're not just observing this , we are the architects of this .
in canada , five boys drop out for every three girls .
the problem is they now prefer [ the ] asynchronistic internet world to the spontaneous interaction in social relationships .
i 'm here to alarm . it 's your job to solve .
he got dementia anyway .
and i 'm teaching myself to knit , which so far i can knit a blob .
what i want is a cure in the next 20 years , soon enough to protect me .
the government and the opposition , they have been simply paralyzed .
so basically i want to ask : what went right and what went wrong in these 50 years when we talk about democracy ?
the very idea , all these collective nouns that we have been taught about -- nation , class , family .
this is also partly a result of the internet revolution .
and by the way , mistrust was always very important for democracy .
so when we talk about transparency , when we talk about openness , i really do believe that what we should keep in mind is that what went right is what went wrong .
karl duncker created this experiment that is used in a whole variety of experiments in behavioral science .
now this is several years ago . adjusted for inflation , it 's a decent sum of money for a few minutes of work .
if you look at the science , there is a mismatch between what science knows and what business does .
in western europe , in many parts of asia , in north america , in australia , white-collar workers are doing less of this kind of work , and more of this kind of work .
let me marshal the evidence here , because i 'm not telling you a story , i 'm making a case .
that 's the american experience .
management is like -- it 's not a tree , it 's a television set .
it 's pretty . it 's not bad . it 's a huge trademark violation , but it 's pretty clever .
well-compensated managers oversaw the whole thing to make sure it came in on budget and on time .
and here 's the best part . here 's the best part .
i went to afghanistan in 2005 to work on a financial times piece , and there i met kamila , a young women who told me she had just turned down a job with the international community that would have paid her nearly $ 2,000 a month -- an astronomical sum in that context .
by the time we met , she had 20 employees , most of them women , who were sending their boys and their girls to school .
and in the developing world overall , that figure is 40 to 50 percent .
how wonderful would it be if we were prepared to replace all of our lofty words with our wallets and invest 500 billion dollars unleashing women 's economic potential ?
and when i was applying to business school and felt certain i couldn 't do it and nobody i knew had done it , i went to my aunt who survived years of beatings at the hand of her husband and escaped a marriage of abuse with only her dignity intact .
we 've got mcpeople , mccars , mchouses .
so here is a typical stud wall , an architectural construction , and this is a section of our proposal for a meat house , where you can see we use fatty cells as insulation , cilia for dealing with wind loads and sphincter muscles for the doors and windows .
it 's going to be a kind of a refrain as we go through the presentation .
and the cool thing about it is i 'm the world 's greatest mouseketeer player .
we 're going to fill up the whole thing , don 't worry .
let 's watch just another clip .
so that gives you a little taste of that piece .
and i thought i was alone in the dark under this tree .
you saw many examples of my work up there , but it 's one that people know .
you suspended these pieces . you let it fall flat on the floor .
prospera : at first sight , they have changed eyes .
but i 'm just going to give you a little example about how one stages it in theater and then how one takes that same idea or story and moves it into cinema .
it 's real , what 's happening .
and no hiking boots .
so , see , kids like us , we have a lot of things to deal with outside of school , and sometimes we 're just not ready to focus .
she 's not going to go anywhere . "
and we made sure that we were still attached to our school district for funding , for support .
teaching elements of persuasion , it doesn 't get any more real than that .
i wanted to go to university , but my father was poor , my uncle even .
i think you guys know it quite well .
and it was for us , the young , the first time really we hear the language of war , of guns .
and this is a bright guy , hard-working person , and pygmy .
and after the war , i have been able to bring it back home , so that we continue our studies .
we have to do it , because to let our movement advance . "
he had the same iridium cell phone like me .
i oppose it -- that they are now going to dissect it , until i do my report and then i see the chief commander .
now we are talking about reconstitution , rebuild africa .
if i know when i was young , that [ by ] killing an elephant , i 'm destroying biodiversity , i would not have done it .
in other words , as men , you are not simply supposed to be in the same physical space with women .
and these were traditions of the middle east -- medieval traditions .
we had a tragic case of an honor killing within turkey 's armenian community just a few months ago .
but besides that , i also saw problems within islamic tradition .
and that 's why actually in the 19th century the ottoman empire , which then covered the whole middle east , made very important reforms -- reforms like giving christians and jews an equal citizenship status , accepting a constitution , accepting a representative parliament , advancing the idea of freedom of religion .
so there 's a very sharp decline in liberal ideas in the muslim world , and what you see is more of a defensive , rigid , reactionary strain , which led to arab socialism , arab nationalism and ultimately to the islamist ideology .
well that process has been a little bit blurred by the fact that not all europeans are that welcoming -- but that 's another discussion .
and i spent two months in the caves of southwest france with the poet clayton eshleman , who wrote a beautiful book called " juniper fuse . "
and so whether that genius is placed into -- technological wizardry has been the great achievement of the west -- or by contrast , into unraveling the complex threads of memory inherent in a myth , is simply a matter of choice and cultural orientation .
our billboards celebrate naked children in underwear .
and for one day , he wears the clothing of his sister and he becomes a transvestite , a waylaka . and for that day , he leads all able-bodied men on a run , but it 's not your ordinary run .
climb huayna picchu , find another altar .
their central metaphor is a loom .
no , it 's not true that they 're kept in the darkness for 18 years , but they are kept within the confines of the ceremonial men 's circle for 18 years .
now , if we slip to another end of the world , i was up in the high arctic to tell a story about global warming , inspired in part by the former vice president 's wonderful book .
and there is indeed a fire burning over the earth , taking with it not only plants and animals , but the legacy of humanity 's brilliance .
and by leveraging the power of the iphone 's processor , we can create a robot that is wi-fi enabled and computer vision-capable for 150 bucks , which is about one percent of what these kinds of robots have cost in the past .
i 've always wanted a picture of a 1,500-person ted audience .
so those are a couple of the really cool things that romo can do today .
and i 'm not a trained academic .
we want to take one child at a time and take the child right through school , sent to college , and get them prepared for better living , a high value job . "
although they are like in different contexts , one is magical , the other two are like investigation , i like those books because they have something special in them .
fathers have started to attend .
take a look at this little girl who was one of the 28 children from all privileged schools , best schools in the country that was selected for the duke university talent identification program and was sent to iim ahmedabad .
they are really excelling .
he 's in kindergarten .
and she wanted to make something of her life , and she asked me a simple little question .
and push ! david gallo says , " push yourself .
or failing that , do the eight things -- and trust me , these are the big eight things that lead to success .
but if that 's happened in the last 5,000 days , what 's going to happen in the next 5,000 days ?
that 's a lot of storage , memory . nine exabyte ram .
first of all , we have all these things in our hands .
the web , in some sense , is kind of like a black hole that 's sucking up everything into it .
mcluhan was saying , " machines are the extensions of the human senses . "
so that 's what we were doing .
why should you be doing that ? you should just do that once , and it should know who all your friends are .
if you want to have total personalization , you have to be totally transparent .
and thirdly , it 's going to become more ubiquitous in terms of filling your entire environment , and we will be in the middle of it .
and 46664 is the number that mandela had when he was imprisoned in robben island .
it 's a grassroots campaign with 80 percent membership being women , most of whom are hiv-positive .
and i 'm very honored by the fact that michel invited me , only a few months ago , to become a unaids ambassador .
so , it was obviously -- it was a very emotional encounter and left us feeling very resonant with this direct experience , this one child , you know , that story .
these corals can be quite kind of mean , you see , and i have surfing scars to prove that .
but this does not mean everything happens .
in contrast , the up-and-down quarks have very large masses , and combine in threes to make the protons and neutrons inside atoms .
electrons have an electric charge , a negative one , and quarks have electric charges in thirds .
nature always keeps a perfect balance .
in order to do this , we need to introduce new forces with new charge directions .
together with quantum mechanics , the geometry of this shape could describe everything about how the universe works at the tiniest scales .
if the lhc finds particles that fit this e8 pattern , that will be very , very cool .
this was a view from my home office on maui .
and that would be what explains all these elementary particles that we see .
when does learning begin ?
one researcher says that they probably sound a lot like the the voice of charlie brown 's teacher in the old " peanuts " cartoon .
by seven months of gestation , the fetus ' taste buds are fully developed , and its olfactory receptors , which allow it to smell , are functioning .
so what a fetus is learning about in utero is not mozart 's " magic flute " but answers to questions much more critical to its survival .
they have higher blood pressure , poorer cholesterol profiles and reduced glucose tolerance -- a precursor of diabetes .
1,700 of these people were pregnant women .
1906 . this man , john philip sousa , traveled to this place , the united states capitol , to talk about this technology , what he called the , quote , " talking machines . "
so , second . land is a kind of property -- it is property . it 's protected by law .
well , they didn 't revolt , and in 1941 , ascap cracked .
you 're every step i make ...
every single use therefore requires permission ; without permission , you are a trespasser .
that artist choice is the key for new technology having an opportunity to be open for business , and we need to build artist choice here if these new technologies are to have that opportunity .
the " blank slate " was an influential idea in the 20th century .
now , these aren 't just differences in anatomy , like the shape of your ear lobes , but they have consequences in thought and behavior that are well illustrated in this famous cartoon by charles addams : " separated at birth , the mallifert twins meet accidentally . "
so even if people did have impulses towards selfishness or greed , that 's not the only thing in the skull , and there are other parts of the mind that can counteract them .
so let me tell you what aroused such irate responses , and i 'll let you decide if whether they -- the claims are really that outrageous .
and the humanities and arts programs in the universities , which by many measures , indeed are in decline .
people are staying away from elite art and criticism .
you might think , well , then they 'd be even more similar , because not only would they share their genes , but they would also share their environment .
and he said that the explosion was so loud and the light was so intense , that he actually had to put his hands in front of his face to protect his eyes .
and i wanted to really shake the lapels of world leaders to get them to understand what is happening .
i had to taste the salt water in my mouth .
and so what had actually happened is that the cells in my fingers had frozen and expanded .
at the very best , i 'm going to end up losing some fingers .
and i said to myself , " lewis , don 't look left , don 't look right .
against the current ! you did it against the current !
now is the time to believe .
but i was still concerned , so i said , " you know what , i 'm not going to do it . "
and he pulled the whole mean down , destroying my statistical significance of the test .
i was eliminating the data to get the true pattern of the data to shine through .
and the unimaginable happened : it became the first car to ever return from a darpa grand challenge , winning stanford 2 million dollars .
you could regain this time .
so this goes against the conventional wisdom that we should tell our friends our goals , right -- so they hold us to it .
well , there 's also another program , in another agency within our government , in ocean exploration .
mostly discoveries made by accident .
back then -- actually my first expedition was when i was 17 years old . it was 49 years ago .
this is all accurate except for one thing -- it 's pitch black .
it was hot . it wasn 't hot enough .
no mouth , no gut , no digestive system .
the ph of 11 , and yet it had chemosynthetic bacteria living in it and at this extreme environment .
more recently , finding ancient history .
it comes online this summer , and it begins its journey of exploration .
but the beauty of this , too , is we can then disseminate it to children .
why do we have programs to build habitation on mars , and we have programs to look at colonizing the moon , but we do not have a program looking at how we colonize our own planet ?
that 's a big thing in california .
i got up in the morning and i didn 't say a word .
" oh , so you really want to go to school here ?
he came back ; he said to me , " ok john , now that you 've registered for that one credit , you can have a key to an office , you can matriculate -- you 're matriculating , so you can use the library .
now this was a discussion class and we were having a discussion .
and i 'm thanking you , and i 'm thanking my family because they had come to hear me speak .
i started talking because i had studied environment .
it took me 100 miles to figure out that , in my heart , in me , i had become a prisoner .
as our former vice president said , we have to become activists .
it 's risk . it 's reward . it 's randomness .
he has this little 10-square-meter store , where so much is being done .
basically , you don 't have to necessarily buy brand new things . you have condemned computers that are stripped apart , and you can buy salvaged components and things that you can reassemble in a new configuration .
so one of the first things we did is this thing called a multimedia platform . we call it a lunch box .
out comes this , a little lunch box -- form factor .
so the real key question was , how do we empower this woman ?
great . good news .
we can speak only with music .
but i wanted to look not at the astronomical universe , but at the computational universe .
we 're just following this very simple rule at the bottom here , but we 're getting all this amazing stuff .
but i 'm happy to say it 's actually going really well .
or let 's try asking about , i don 't know , the international space station .
but , in many ways , we 're still at the very beginning with wolfram alpha .
let 's try this here .
i 'm hoping we can , for example , use that even to get wolfram alpha to routinely do invention and discovery on the fly , and to find all sorts of wonderful stuff that no engineer and no process of incremental evolution would ever come up with .
one 's got to build a structure that 's probably at least as deep as existing physics .
sw : i think so .
but diagnosing a brain disorder without actually looking at the brain is analogous to treating a patient with a heart problem based on their physical symptoms , without even doing an ecg or a chest x-ray to look at the heart .
within a period of 60 days , his vocabulary went from two to three words to 300 words .
all these things , they come back to plants .
so if you 're going to build a seed bank , you have to decide what you 're going to store in it . right ?
so all around the world people are doing the same thing .
2,800 dollars per species is the average .
torture , very funny .
and i mean like this is a nerdy crowd , but that 's like a couple of levels above furries .
there 's a whole gray market for lego , thousands of home-based businesses .
but deep down , i knew that the right decision was to go home , even if i didn 't fully recognize the woman who was making that choice .
he 's much more likely to bring in new clients for his firm than a lawyer who never leaves his office .
they got married five years ago , and now they have two-year-old twins .
men are still socialized to believe that they have to be breadwinners , that to derive their self-worth from how high they can climb over other men on a career ladder .
indeed , there are male college students now who are starting to say , " i want to be a stay-at-home dad . "
thank you .
it shows how observation , curiosity and instinct work to create amazing art .
this is the final product . when they sent it to me , i thought i 'd failed .
how the hell do i do a telephone in three weeks , when you get these things that take hundreds of million years to evolve ?
these interrelated forms , they do inspire everything i do although i might end up making something incredibly simple .
if you took the idea of fractal technology further , take a membrane , shrinking it down constantly like nature does -- that could be a seat for a chair ; it could be a sole for a sports shoe ; it could be a car blending into seats .
this is a new chair which should come on the market in september .
single-surface products . furniture 's a good one .
its cars are made from 30,000 components .
forget that . we move on .
that 's my studio . it 's subterranean .
that thing on the top is the world 's first solar-powered garden lamp -- the first produced . giles revell should be talking here today -- amazing photography of things you can 't see .
so , it 's going to end .
they 've found small objects such as these .
well let me show you .
which of these hypotheses can be true ?
are you ready ?
there 's a lot of text that start with this diamond-shaped symbol .
now here 's one other thing you can do with the computer model .
i even started to get some hate mail .
they used to trade with people pretty far away from where they lived , and so in this case , they were traveling by sea all the way to mesopotamia , present-day iraq .
so this is just like a crossword puzzle , except that this is the mother of all crossword puzzles because the stakes are so high if you solve it .
why should we care ?
beverly 's clearly one of them , and this little leopard , legadema , is another , and she changed our lives .
dj : now one of the big things , of course , everybody knows that cats hate water , and so this was a real revelation for us .
but for us to get them , not only do we push ourselves , but we live by certain rules of engagement , which mean we can 't interfere .
we were spending so much time with this leopard and getting to understand her individualism , her personal character , that maybe we were taking it a little bit far .
so what we watched over the next couple of hours was very unique .
now in the extraordinary time that we have worked with legadema -- which is really over a five-year period -- 10,000 leopards were legally shot by safari hunters .
if they disappear , whole ecosystems in africa disappear .
but after one week of practicing , my throws became more like this .
i passed an audition for cirque du soleil .
it 's not really true .
and the other theory is that we smell molecular vibrations .
this is cis-3-hexene-1-ol . it smells of cut grass .
if it didn 't , the whole idea was toast , and i might as well move on to other things .
in other words , no mirrors , no lasers , no prisms , no nonsense , just a tiny device , and he built this device . and this device uses electron tunneling .
it 's the molecule that has made men 's fragrances smell the way they do since 1881 , to be exact .
you 're right , and i don 't care how you do it , in a sense ; you bring me the molecules , you know .
and i think the only way to avoid it is to have some horrible visible disease , and then you don 't have to explain .
timesharing is a little further off in the future .
but lots of people now live to 90 or 100 , unless they shake hands too much or something like that .
and they don 't always work together . i like freud 's theory that most of them are cancelling each other out .
so you may ask -- you may ask me , well how do you know what our energy future is ?
that is me at the control panel of my fusion reactor .
you 're down to a third of the speed , a third of the power , and a good bicyclist can put out that power , and that worked , and we won the prize a year later .
i wanted to show the slide -- this slide , i think , is the most important one any of you will see , ever , because -- -- it shows nature versus humans , and goes from 1850 to 2050 .
suddenly , we humans , a recently arrived species , no longer subject to the checks and balances inherent in nature , have grown in population , technology and intelligence to a position of terrible power . we , now , wield the paintbrush . "
pm : that plane has many purposes , but it 's aimed for communications , and it can fly so slowly that it 'll just stay up at 65,000 feet .
tm : oh , 10 , 11 .
and these will be some simple design qualities and they will also be some qualities of , if you will , the intelligence of interaction .
and so when you see on the market these systems that have just a few light emitting diodes on the side and are very low resolution , it 's nice that they exist because it still is better than nothing .
now , imagine a screen , which is not only touch-sensitive now , it 's pressure-sensitive .
we are so used to doing monologues .
so , what i will show you is ... it 's a rather boring book , but i 'm afraid sometimes you have to do boring books because your sponsors aren 't necessarily interested in fiction and entertainment . and this is a book on how to repair a transmission .
and of course , good education has got to be good entertainment , so my first example will be drawn from a very recent experiment that we 've been doing -- in this case , in senegal -- where we have tried to use personal computers as a pedagogical medium . but not as teaching machines at all ; the whole notion is to use this as an instrument where there is a complete reversal of roles -- the child is , if you will , the teacher and the machine is the student -- and the art of computer programming is a vehicle that sort of approximates thinking about thinking .
and that story has many other anecdotes that are similar , but wow . the key to the future of computers in education is right there , and it is : when does it mean something to a child ?
yes , it is . it 's our work -- that was a while ago , and it still is my favorite project -- of teleconferencing .
or i was one of the people who did it .
i thought , look at the impact that my research has had .
so you start with a book , and then you scan it .
so every time you buy tickets on ticketmaster , you help to digitize a book .
i 'm sure some of you have heard about it .
so based on this question , we 've had a lot of different projects that we 've been working on .
now some of you may say , why can 't we use computers to translate ?
so back to the question .
now when we were starting to think about this , we were blocked by these two things .
people really can learn a language with it .
and we could do it in about 80 hours with a million active users .
we like to dance together , we like singing together .
i mean , i 'm not saying the law of entropy is wrong -- it 's not .
but except for that difference , the rules are the same for both .
there doesn 't seem to be anything mystical about this .
for a long time it was not believed when the first western travelers , like sir francis drake , went to thailand and came back with tales of this unbelievable spectacle .
it would be all atoms pulsating in unison , emitting light of one color , one frequency .
so i 'm going to give them a chance to do that .
and within two days the bridge was closed to the public .
that 's right . and it seemed obvious to me that it was probably the number of people on it .
this synchronized movement seemed to be driving the bridge .
interviewer : for a more convincing experiment , i wanted my own opening-day crowd , the sound check team .
this is a question i 've long asked myself .
what gets us to do this , what get us to forward thrust more is to value the near win .
success motivates us , but a near win can propel us in an ongoing quest .
we build out of the unfinished idea , even if that idea is our former self .
so we go out for about five months every summer in a 20-meter catamaran , and we live , sleep and work at sea for weeks at a time .
so dolphins can buzz and tickle each other at a distance .
for example , they babysit each other 's calves .
and one of the reasons we thought we could do this is because the dolphins were starting to show us a lot of mutual curiosity .
they could point at the visual object , or they could mimic the whistle .
and i 'm trying to lead her back to the keyboard .
now , will they learn to mimic the whistles functionally ?
this is a hospital building .
and this is a project for a bridge .
and instead , we had to learn -- we kind of forced them to teach us .
we won the competition , and it was painful to get there .
but this phenomenal project 's been happening .
and so the rest of the site was a public space .
and the project that we 're building in malaysia is apartment buildings for a property developer .
this optic was 22 feet long .
and so there 's companies like face.com that now have about 18 billion faces online .
if you won , she would marry you .
but recently , i 've become intrigued by a different way of thinking of large human crowds , because there are circumstances where they can do something really cool .
... months of preparation crammed into 18 minutes , raising the bar cruelly for the next generation of speakers , with the effects that we 've seen this week .
and the desire part comes , i guess , from social status , right ?
it 's by giving away what you think is your deepest secret that maybe millions of people are empowered to help improve it .
we spark off each other .
suddenly , he starts to emulate and then to innovate .
but even leaving the screen out of it , there 's still a lot more being transferred than just words .
i mean , today , one person speaking can be seen by millions , shedding bright light on potent ideas , creating intense desire for learning and to respond -- and in his case , intense desire to laugh .
that changes everything , right ?
we have our own film school .
now what is so interesting and to some , the extent , what 's a bit infamous about " the origin of species , " is that there is only one line in it about human evolution .
the incrementally cooler colors -- blues , greens , yellows , and finally grays -- indicate areas of much lower ultraviolet radiation .
so melanin was recruited , in our lineage , and specifically in our earliest ancestors evolving in africa , to be a natural sunscreen .
a remarkable , remarkable testament to the power of evolution .
so we have , in skin pigmentation , one of these wonderful products of evolution that still has consequences for us today .
i think , were he able to look at the evidence we have today , he would understand it .
so i made a deal with the adults that the kids could come in without any adults for two minutes on their own .
so that we can stop compartmentalizing form , function and aesthetic , and assigning them different values .
actually , i have them on stage with me : grapevines , magnolias -- truly stunning .
and a girl was there who has known me for years at my normal 5 ' 8 " .
so my grandfather told me when i was a little girl , " if you say a word often enough , it becomes you . "
concourse two : dallas , fort worth . same voice .
ooh , he 's going to steal ; he 's going to steal ; he 's going to do a terrible thing . ' just then , two slavers caught up , guys chasing slaves , looking for jim .
it raises questions about what nature is , what mother nature is , and about what a risk can be .
i could hear it , but i dared not to move . i didn 't move .
i was so petrified and so numb , all i could look was in the rear-view mirror .
and this is called , " swallowing the bitterness . "
they became so hilarious , but i was happy for them .
i mean , you know , i mean , it 's like my wife , jolene , her family 's always saying , you know , you ever think he 's just a born loser ?
i mean , look how we are , the roughy family , palling around and shaking hands and wrestling around me .
as you see , everything starts to fade to black , and you see people going to sleep .
this is looking at ascending versus descending flights .
this is baron wolfgang von kempelen 's mechanical chess playing machine .
and juxtaposed against this grid , you see actually , by rolling over each individual one , the humanity behind this hugely mechanical process .
and he says , " it 's not about a scientific rendering of a sheep .
and other people would draw stick figures or smiley faces .
we wanted to see how this applies to collaborative , distributed music making , where nobody has any idea what it is they 're working on .
and he ended up talking to rick rubin , who was finishing up johnny cash 's final album called " ain 't no grave . "
it 's the sum total of his life , all the things that had happened -- the bad things , the good things .
but most importantly , i think , we really wanted to make an experience that was unlike the johnny cash project , where you had a small group of people spending a lot of time to contribute something for everyone .
it 's a new form of energy storage that i invented at mit along with a team of my students and post-docs .
instead , let 's invent to the price point of the electricity market .
it is this that caught and held my attention to the point that i became obsessed with inventing a battery that could capture this gigantic economy of scale .
and the current passing between the electrodes generates enough heat to keep it at temperature .
and we got the same remarkable results .
avoid thermal runaway .
and one of his first clients was -- this is many years ago , back in the early ' 70s -- one of his first clients was pepsi .
and one day , he was sitting in a diner in white plains , about to go trying to dream up some work for nescafe .
but it was , technically speaking -- this is an aside -- prego is a better tomato sauce than ragu .
instead , he looked at the data , and he said , let 's see if we can group all these different data points into clusters .
people don 't know what they want ! right ?
much more volatile brown mustard seed , some white wine , a nose hit , much more delicate aromatics . and what do they do ?
for the longest time in the food industry , there was a sense that there was one way , a perfect way , to make a dish .
psychologists , medical scientists , economists were all interested in finding out the rules that govern the way all of us behave .
actually , truthfully , we moved to los angeles -- -- thinking we were moving to america , but anyway , it 's a short plane ride from los angeles to america .
but the dropout crisis is just the tip of an iceberg .
education under no child left behind is based on not diversity but conformity .
curiosity is the engine of achievement .
but if nobody 's learning anything , she may be engaged in the task of teaching but not actually fulfilling it .
i mean , you may have a dog .
and they all looked a bit bemused , and said , " well , we don 't have one .
the trouble is that education doesn 't go on in the committee rooms of our legislative buildings .
and they work .
great leaders know that .
so we don 't know , for example , how many people right now are being affected by disasters or by conflict situations .
and what we 're looking at here is a truckful o ' data .
this is what we base our decisions on in global health : little data , old data , no data .
the problem was , after a few years of doing that , i realized i had done -- i had been to maybe six or seven programs , and i thought , you know , if i keep this up at this pace , over my whole career , maybe i 'm going to go to maybe 20 or 30 programs .
you know , i 'd been trained that the way that you distribute technology within international development is always consultant-based .
so we created software called magpi , which has an online form creator .
camfed , another charity based out of the u.k. , camfed pays girls ' families to keep them in school .
you may remember this as the aol-time warner merger , okay , heralded at the time as the largest single deal of all time .
now , these are trivial marketing examples , i accept .
a yellow sign ? that 's exactly what they 'll be expecting .
let 's face it , most of us -- how many of you actually check your balance before you remove cash from a cash machine ?
moving over , we come , of course , to consultancy .
he was livid , and i still remember how we cried when that cart with our half-eaten sweets was pulled away from us .
open knowledge , open aid , open governance , and together , they represent three key shifts that are transforming development and that also hold greater hope for the problems i witnessed in uganda and in bihar .
and as you can see , it 's not really accessible or understandable to an ordinary citizen that is trying to understand how the government is spending its resources .
today , i 'm inspired by these changes , and i 'm excited that at the world bank , we are embracing these new directions , a significant departure from my work in uganda 20 years ago .
joyce 's mother is now taking care of her daughter , like so many other zimbabwean children who 've been orphaned by the epidemic .
now there is much to gain and benefit from this massive analysis of personal information , or big data , but there are also complex tradeoffs that come from giving away our privacy .
of course , the accuracy keeps getting worse .
we created facebook profiles , manipulating traits , then we started sending out résumés to companies in the u.s. , and we detected , we monitored , whether they were searching for our candidates , and whether they were acting on the information they found on social media . and they were .
to another group of subjects , we told them , " students and faculty will see your answers . "
of course , these technologies imply a shifting of cost and revenues between data holders and data subjects , which is why , perhaps , you don 't hear more about them .
so i do believe that one of the defining fights of our times will be the fight for the control over personal information , the fight over whether big data will become a force for freedom , rather than a force which will hiddenly manipulate us .
organizing a marathon in lebanon is definitely not like organizing one in new york .
the country was divided again , so much that our parliament resigned , we had no president for a year , and no prime minister .
bma has become such a respected event in the region that government officials in the region like iraq , egypt and syria , have asked the organization to help them structure a similar sporting event .
they have a hut that has no electricity , no running water , no wristwatch , no bicycle .
they built a new house , this time with running water , electricity , a bicycle , no pig .
well , you know this latter group , you 're wrong .
it 's kind of like the dirty , little secret of poverty , which is that , not only do poor people take in very little income , but also , the income that they take in , they don 't spend it very wisely , and unfortunately , most of that spending is done by men .
and that does not even include those that are trafficked within country borders , which is a substantial portion .
the villagers thought she was cursed ; they didn 't know what to do with her .
he was kind of a gambler type -- and unemployable , therefore -- and took his frustrations out on her .
well , it just so happens , at that time , there was a group in connecticut called the niantic community church group in connecticut .
you know , people say how half of all water well projects , a year later , are failed .
and then she came back to the united states and was on break , christmas break .
but there 's still a lot of work to do .
you weed down through various steps that cause many of these to fail .
how does that play out in terms of application to a disease ?
but when there is something that i really do want to do that progeria gets in the way of , like marching band or umpiring , we always find a way to do it , and that just shows that progeria isn 't in control of my life .
it was developed for cancer . it was azt .
and ultimately , because you can do this for the individual , we could even see this moving to the point where the ability to develop and test medicines will be you on a chip , what we 're trying to say here is the individualizing of the process of developing drugs and testing their safety .
i worked at philips electronics in the far-future design research lab , looking 20 years into the future .
it completely blows apart the way that perfume is , and provides a whole new format .
it 's sort of like thanksgiving with your conservative uncle on steroids , with a live television audience of millions .
so when i first went to go work at fox news , true confession , i expected there to be marks in the carpet from all the knuckle-dragging .
this whole finding compassion and common ground with your enemies thing is kind of like a political-spiritual practice for me , and i ain 't the dalai lama .
what exactly to the people watching this do every day ?
and within just a couple years , san francisco became the first no-kill city , running no deficit , completely supported by the community .
you can make a lot of change . you can get roads built .
and , unfortunately , it doesn 't work so well anymore either .
people i know who are firemen told me that this is not uncommon .
they 're about the same age . but that 's about it .
he just stepped up and said , " follow me . "
she doesn 't do it by quietly building one house at a time .
my friend red maxwell has spent the last 10 years fighting against juvenile diabetes .
finally , they commit .
it 's urgent work . we know that temperatures are rising .
they cut the cylinders up into three-foot sections for easier handling and shipment back to these labs , some 8,000 miles from the drill site .
this process requires extraordinary precautions .
but today i worry about , what if all we do is sell more cars and trucks ?
so when i was born , i guess you could say expectations were kind of high for me .
i was considered a radical .
and this is going to create the kind of global gridlock that the world has never seen before .
today we need that same leap in thinking for us to create a viable future .
and i often have to leave the freeway and look for different ways for me to try and make it home .
and we need people from all walks of life ; not just inventors , we need policymakers and government officials to also think about how they 're going to respond to this challenge .
i ran away .
and for me it 's just the idea that , if this little girl graduates as a whole person , chances are she 'll demand a whole world -- a whole world -- to live on .
and this thing is the second vortex to be built in the world , in a two-and-a-half meter drop on a river .
i asked him , " why ? "
we manage to keep the garden that was there running right up to the edge of each of the classrooms .
this is called mud wrestling in the rice fields .
it 's as strong and dense as teak and it will hold up any roof .
so , mr. gore , thank you .
now , when i talk about the northeast monsoon season , i 'm sure many of you here know exactly what i mean , but perhaps some of you are not quite so sure .
they need fresh water to breed .
it 's a rather mediocre looking dragonfly .
but slowly it began to dawn on me that something rather special was happening .
wait for the go . i 'll say go .
so , next thing i did is i got on the phone .
it 's about five kilometers around , counting the dragonflies as i go , trying not to bump into people as i 'm looking in the trees .
it doesn 't make sense . there is nothing for them in maldives .
and they are breeding in the rains of africa .
not only that , because you have this convection , you have this rising of the air where it 's hot , air is drawn in .
and it 's called the amur falcon because it breeds in amurland .
those of you from northern india will be familiar with this .
regarding cyberattacks against the american company google .
similarly , if we 'd had this talk 30 or 40 years ago , we would have seen how the rise of nuclear weapons , and the threat of mutually assured destruction they imply , prevents a direct fight between the two superpowers .
in a major article published in 1978 , professor robert jervis of columbia university in new york described a model to understand how conflicts could arise .
and let me guess , how many of you , when you arrived here , like me , went and bought a pay-as-you-go sim card ? yeah ?
and the reason it isn 't is because everybody 's watching television or playing angry birds .
we have really severe energy problems in africa .
he comes from pretoria , the capital of [ south africa ] , about 50 kilometers from where i live .
in this way of thinking , it 's character and conscience , not cold-hearted calculation , that will save us .
in particular , can it explain a momentous historical development that i spoke about five years ago here at ted ?
rng : i 'm all for empathy . i mean , who isn 't ?
their essay would go viral , get translated into many languages , get debated at pubs and coffee houses and salons , and at dinner parties , and influence leaders , legislators , popular opinion .
erasmus : the advantages derived from peace diffuse themselves far and wide , and reach great numbers , while in war , if anything turns out happily , the advantage redounds only to a few , and those unworthy of reaping it .
jeremy bentham : the question is not , can they reason , nor can they talk , but can they suffer ?
rng : the appeal to religion to justify the otherwise unjustifiable , such as the ban on contraception .
i 'll prove them wrong on both points .
but they have good quality .
i 'm going into some details here , because [ the ] u.n. do it like this .
you know , these economists , they love money , they want more and more of it , they want it to grow .
congo got into civil war , and they leveled off here .
but look , the rate of lowering in sweden was not fast .
kenya is now speeding up .
it got down there -- china comes into the western box here .
how the heck could they be [ a ] developing country ?
thank you very much .
six months into the lawsuit , we finally reached the discovery phase .
first of all , if you can , don 't fight the patent , fight the infringement .
and as a result , patent trolls can kind of live in the space in between .
sopa stands for the stop online piracy act .
cassette tapes , video cassette recorders , even the humble xerox machine created new opportunities for us to behave in ways that astonished the media business .
it took them a while to formulate plan b.
but where the dmca was surgical -- we want to go down into your computer , we want to go down into your television set , down into your game machine , and prevent it from doing what they said it would do at the store -- pipa and sopa are nuclear and they 're saying , we want to go anywhere in the world and censor content .
because this seems like a national issue , but it is not .
because that 's the real message of pipa and sopa .
but my passion -- in addition to jack and my children -- are the plants , the so-called epiphytes , those plants that grow up on trees .
these canopy communities are fragile .
what we do , my students in my lab and i , is we buy barbies from goodwill and value village , we dress her in clothes that have been made by seamstresses and we send her out with a canopy handbook .
so i engaged caution , this rap singer , with a group of young people from inner-city tacoma .
we 've been successful as partners in figuring out which species grow the fastest , and i 've just been overwhelmed with how successful this has been .
in these partnerships , i have also learned that people tend to compartmentalize themselves into it people , and movie star people , and scientists , but when we share nature , when we share our perspectives about nature , we find a common denominator .
even in stories on gender-based violence , men get an overwhelming majority of print space and airtime .
it 's a very different picture .
texas state university professor cindy royal wondered in her blog , " how are young women like her students supposed to feel about their roles in technology reading wired ? "
but he did have one suggestion .
it 's for the guardian newspaper .
i 'll never forget , the tvs played this endless reel of cartoons .
in 1965 dr. geiger founded one of the first two community health centers in this country , in a brutally poor area in the mississippi delta .
what if we decided to make a different set of choices ?
you need more .
health just takes more time .
mia says , " when my classmates write a prescription , they think their work is done .
i believe that at the end of the day when we measure our healthcare , it will not be by the diseases cured , but by the diseases prevented .
when i was six years old , i fell in love with magic .
so that 's it . i 'm 14 ; i 'm becoming a juggler .
tenacity is how i kept at it against all odds .
on the high wire , within months , i 'm able to master all the tricks they do in the circus , except i am not satisfied .
an inner howl assails me , the wild longing to flee .
now i have done the impossible not once , but many times .
and then in the most magnificent gesture , i send the bird of peace into the azure .
for a moment , the entire crowd had forgotten their differences .
but these four questions , actually , are ones that people who even know quite a lot about science find quite hard .
but , actually , we don 't do that .
it 's so easy , isn 't it ? of course , you all knew that .
i hope you notice the coincidence here .
so , as " monty python " would have it , this is a bit lord privy seal to say so , but this is -- children are not empty vessels .
finally , my plea to you is to allow yourselves , and your children , and anyone you know , to kind of fiddle with stuff , because it 's by fiddling with things that you , you know , you complement your other learning . it 's not a replacement , it 's just part of learning that 's important .
now , one recent discovery that has been made by researchers in italy , in parma , by giacomo rizzolatti and his colleagues , is a group of neurons called mirror neurons , which are on the front of the brain in the frontal lobes .
if you go back in time about [ 75,000 ] to 100,000 years ago , let 's look at human evolution , it turns out that something very important happened around 75,000 years ago .
now , the question then arises : if i simply watch another person being touched , why do i not get confused and literally feel that touch sensation merely by watching somebody being touched ?
so , here you have my last slide .
so let 's move to chapter two : the oil era .
that is in less than 60 years .
we have no water whatsoever .
and so someone has to really realize when the crisis is going to happen .
and that is a lot of water .
when i think about the world i would like to leave to my daughter and the grandchildren i hope to have , it is a world that moves away from unequal , unstable , unsustainable interdependence to integrated communities -- locally , nationally and globally -- that share the characteristics of all successful communities : a broadly shared , accessible set of opportunities , a shared sense of responsibility for the success of the common enterprise and a genuine sense of belonging .
you saw one reference to that in what we were able to do with aids drugs .
we started a childhood obesity initiative with the heart association in america .
so what we have been trying to do , working first in rwanda and then in malawi and other places -- but i want to talk about rwanda tonight -- is to develop a model for rural health care in a very poor area that can be used to deal with aids , tb , malaria , other infectious diseases , maternal and child health , and a whole range of health issues poor people are grappling with in the developing world , that can first be scaled for the whole nation of rwanda , and then will be a model that could literally be implemented in any other poor country in the world .
recently we did an evaluation of the first 18 months of our efforts in rwanda .
that 's lower than the figure in the united states .
these people have been through a lot and none of us , most of all me , helped them when they were on the verge of destroying each other .
perhaps something very naughty .
because what i was looking for was right in front of my eyes -- in google , my company .
there is so much organic social action all around google that the company decided to form a social responsibility team just to support these efforts .
and they , according to the research , make the best business leaders .
so in google , there 's a lot of autonomy .
what does that mean ?
that culprit is business and industry , which happens to be where i have spent the last 52 years since my graduation from georgia tech in 1956 .
and though the equation is largely subjective , you can perhaps quantify people , and perhaps quantify affluence , but technology is abusive in too many ways to quantify .
net greenhouse gas emissions down 82 percent in absolute tonnage .
and this is perhaps the most important facet : we have found mission zero to be incredibly good for business .
i remain troubled by the revised ehrlich equation , i equals p times a divided by t2 .
but about five days later back in atlanta , i received an email from glenn thomas , one of my people in the california meeting .
so the machine i 'm going to talk you about is what i call the greatest machine that never was .
so as i go through this talk , i want you to imagine this gigantic machine . we heard those wonderful sounds of what this thing would have sounded like .
all this cog wheel mechanism here is doing is what a computer does , but of course you need to program this thing , and of course , babbage used the technology of the day and the technology that would reappear in the ' 50s , ' 60s and ' 70s , which is punch cards . this thing over here is one of three punch card readers in here , and this is a program in the science museum , just not far from here , created by charles babbage , that is sitting there — you can go see it — waiting for the machine to be built .
now , imagine these soirees , all these great and good comes along .
now , of course , babbage 's machine was entirely mechanical .
one was the scanning of babbage 's archive .
but we want to use our brain !
i bet many of you have seen the apple commercials , kind of poking at the pc for their brilliance and simplicity .
we do this all through software , algorithms and math -- a highly automated pipeline creating these cities .
and the first story is called " the faulty switch . "
children don 't like it .
now these provisional structures have , in some cases , remained standing for the better part of a human lifetime .
the bathrooms and kitchens will , of course , have no windows .
so let 's take a look at the brain .
and that 's shown here in the the very light blue .
and each neuron itself is largely unique .
we want to make sure that we have normal humans between the ages of 20 to 60 , they died a somewhat natural death with no injury to the brain , no history of psychiatric disease , no drugs on board -- we do a toxicology workup .
and then what we get is our first mapping .
and then the laser actually cuts .
so here 's the modalities that we put together .
and for the first time , we can actually do that .
but the fact is our genomes are greater than 99 percent similar .
they give researchers a handle on where to go .
shipping is as crucial to us as it has ever been .
i have friends in the navy who tell me they sail with 1,000 sailors at a time , but on kendal there were only 21 crew .
we were no longer allowed on deck .
light doesn 't penetrate beneath the surface of the water , so ocean creatures like whales and dolphins and even 800 species of fish communicate by sound .
six years before that , i was starting my career as an opera singer in europe , when i was diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary hypertension -- also known as ph .
i had a heart catheterization , where they measure this internal arterial pulmonary pressure , which is supposed to be between 15 and 20 .
then in february of 2008 , my grandfather passed away .
if it didn 't , i 'd probably see my father sooner than i anticipated .
but the next morning , while i was still in the hospital , i got a telephone call .
he said it would kill me .
thank you .
and it 's kind of like a high altitude mountaineering trip in reverse , except that you 're now running a string of these things down .
now i remember that term really well for two reasons .
for those who have never seen this story , jim cameron produced a really wonderful imax movie couple of years ago , called " aliens of the deep . "
how do you take a robot and turn it into a field microbiologist ?
what i 'm going to show you next are a couple of controversial ideas .
there is a place where you can .
you can burn rocket fuel to get there , or you can do something really incredible .
i intend to lead that expedition .
just two things .
so , i left his office and i was walking through the hospital , and that 's when i had my epiphany .
so , next thing you know , i had my bright blue volunteer vest , i had my photo id , and i was fully trained by my 89-year-old boss .
one of the guys i hired was an engineer named jack dorsey , and a year later , when we were trying to decide which way to go with odeo , jack presented an idea he 'd been tinkering around with for a number of years that was based around sending simple status updates to friends .
politicians have recently begun twittering .
this not only lets you view twitters in different ways , but it introduces new use cases as well .
worst talk ever ! "
blocks have names .
domo arigato gozaimashita .
we copy this in the lab by outfitting cell culture systems with electrodes .
let 's remind ourselves that cells are not an abstract concept .
so when i say full , i mean really full -- well past any margin for error , well past any dispute about methodology .
that 's all true .
see what happens when you operate a system past its limits and then keep on going at an ever-accelerating rate is that the system stops working and breaks down .
in my view , it is well underway .
imagine what it means for your personal security as a heavily armed civilian population gets angrier and angrier about why this was allowed to happen .
think about war .
when we think about the future i paint , of course we should feel a bit of fear .
birds are very agile .
so within the motor , we have three hall sensors , so we know exactly where the wing is .
and he should have said , " what a strange , long trip it 's about to become . "
the geopolitical world has got a lot to learn from the digital world .
anyway , on our last day at this orphanage a man handed me his baby and said , " would you take my son with you ? "
because this is not all about charity .
and deep down , if we really accepted that africans were equal to us , we would all do more to put the fire out .
there 's an opportunity here , and it 's real .
more anti-retrovirals make sense .
i 'm sorry to laugh here , but you do look so different than you did in haight-ashbury in the ' 60s .
actually , i come from punk rock .
they made some really great promises , and actually have fulfilled a lot of them .
there 's the continent africa .
this business , it gets to be addictive , you know what i mean , when somebody else is picking up the tab .
that 's one billion media hits .
americans have an unprecedented opportunity .
the average waiting time to get a landline in ethiopia is actually about seven or eight years .
everybody in this room , if you stay alive , is going to be affected by what 's happening in cities in this extraordinary phenomenon .
is edinburgh a horse ?
that 's called growth .
and what you see if you plot it in this slightly curious way is that everybody lies on the same line .
if you take those networks , this idea of networks , and you apply universal principles , mathematizable , universal principles , all of these scalings and all of these constraints follow , including the description of the forest , the description of your circulatory system , the description within cells .
and any infrastructure you look at -- whether it 's the length of roads , length of electrical lines -- anything you look at has the same economy of scale scaling in the same way .
always , all the data shows it 's the same , despite the fact that these cities have evolved independently .
what we do is , as we grow and we approach the collapse , a major innovation takes place and we start over again , and we start over again as we approach the next one , and so on .
that 's what we like , hockey sticks .
other people are not as elastic .
nanophysics and nanotechnology , for instance , have really opened the designer 's mind .
when you don 't have to kill cows and it can have any shape , what should it be like ?
it 's only recently that this kind of marriage between design and science is producing some of the first " pretty " -- if we can say so -- scientific presentations .
it takes seven days today to manufacture a chair , but you know what ? one day it will take seven hours .
some designers don 't design objects , products , things that we 're going to actually use , but rather , they design scenarios that are object-based .
so it 's a series of dolls that he 's working on right now .
you see , even if the idea of the election is perfect , running a countrywide election is a big project , and big projects are messy .
how do we make an election system completely verifiable while keeping the votes absolutely secret ?
votes can 't go missing because then you won 't find yours when you look for it .
and for this purpose , we placed two hemisections on opposite sides of the body .
first , we have to provide the fuel ; second , press the accelerator pedal ; third , steer the car .
the electrochemical neuroprosthesis enabled a highly functional state of the spinal locomotor networks .
it occurred throughout the central nervous system , including in the brain stem , where we observed up to 300-percent increase in the density of fibers coming from the brain .
and this is a radically new concept that may apply to other neurological disorders , what i termed " personalized neuroprosthetics , " where by sensing and stimulating neural interfaces , i implanted throughout the nervous system , in the brain , in the spinal cord , even in peripheral nerves , based on patient-specific impairments .
it exists . what is a snob ?
one of these , and it 's paradoxical because it 's linked to something that 's rather nice , is the hope we all have for our careers .
but the problem , generally , of modern society , is that it turns the whole world into a school . everybody is wearing jeans , everybody is the same .
and that makes failure seem much more crushing .
i 'm drawn to a lovely quote by st. augustine in " the city of god , " where he says , " it 's a sin to judge any man by his post . "
now is there any alternative to this ?
we are the first society to be living in a world where we don 't worship anything other than ourselves .
you can 't be successful at everything .
let 's probe away at our notions of success .
alain de botton .
type the first letter of your state over and over and over .
okay , so most of you think of google as something that lets you look up a webpage , but it is also a dictionary .
it 's extremely frustrating on any camera under 1,000 dollars .
and this is the africa where people are looking for partnerships to do this . that 's what i want to talk about today .
that is that people talk about corruption , corruption .
no one can do it for you . you have to do it for yourself .
because nobody 's going to help you and support you if you 're not managing your own finances well .
we have opportunities in solid minerals . we have a lot of minerals that no one has even invested in or explored . and we realized that without the proper legislation to make that possible , that wouldn 't happen . so we 've now got a mining code that is comparable with some of the best in the world .
i 'm trying to tell you that since the past three years , the average rate of growth on the continent has moved from about 2.5 percent to about five percent per annum .
one of the women in this video , adenike ogunlesi , making children 's clothes -- which she started as a hobby and grew into a business .
it 's a very powerful word , jihad , if you look at it in that respect , and there 's a certain almost mystical resonance to it .
he was wrong . some people were paying attention , but for the wrong reasons .
and so there 's now a lot of different violent jihads all over the world .
but that 's still not reason for us to disengage , because we 've seen that movie before , in afghanistan .
any claim that al qaeda had to being protectors of islam against the western crusaders was drowned in the blood of iraqi muslims .
time , patience , subtlety , understanding -- these are harder to give .
because i feel like , you know , there are so many images out there , so many clothes out there .
and anyway , roll this little clip , i 'll just show you .
and i had this really interesting tarot reading a long time ago .
so in editing these clips , i didn 't have the audacity to edit a clip of me singing at joe 's pub .
and many of my friends were ballet dancers .
too much time on computer bridge , which is , you know , like that 's so ... somehow , like , about ten years ago i thought that the most unboring place in the world would be like a t.v. studio , like for a day show . some kind of day talk show .
im : you look so cute already , by the way .
rod : no , i love it . it 's the new me .
it 's , like , this website .
just because i don 't know that whole -- that there 's no such thing as whole buttermilk .
to be new at ted -- it 's like being the last high-school virgin .
at the point where you can weaponize your buildings , you have to suddenly think about architecture in a very different way .
so , in the american tradition , the difference between the technocratic and the romantic , would be the difference between thomas jefferson 's cartesian grids spreading across the united states , that gives us basically the whole shape of every western state in the united states , as a really , truly , technocratic solution , a bowing to the -- in jefferson 's time -- current , popular philosophy of rationalism .
yeah , it 's one of those giant camera lenses that takes a picture of the outside world -- it 's sort of a little movie , without any moving parts -- and projects it on a page , and you can see the world outside you as you walk around it .
you 're underneath it , looking up into the lens of the camera obscura .
they were asked to design , replace that bridge in six weeks , building it , including all of the parts , manufactured .
this is happening by itself .
the first principle is : it 's the politics that matters .
it 's not the politics first ; it 's actually the politics last .
it needs to be a decade-long approach , rather than just a couple of years .
so the inclusion agenda means genuinely bringing people inside the tent .
those are the three critical priorities .
during conflict people are doing destruction .
and so what i 'd suggest is what i call independent service authorities .
it 's captured by the crooks who are at the heart of the political problem .
the quote is from the fabled potter stewart opinion on pornography .
and here i 've corrupted the potter stewart quotation by saying that we can think about something -- which spans all the way from scissors to the cell phone , internet and birth control pills -- by saying that they 're simple , the functions are simple , and we recognize what that simplicity is when we see it .
simplicity -- all of you really would like your waring blender in the morning to make whatever a waring blender does , but not explode or play beethoven .
terrific . you learn everything you can about that .
you can catch errors with it , it 's unambiguous in its reading , there are lots of good things about binary .
the two blobs that are light in the middle there are the united states and europe .
but if you have something that has a function , and it 's really cheap , people will find new ways of putting it together to make new things .
part of my interest in this , i have to say , is that i would like to -- how do i put this politely ? -- change the way , or maybe eviscerate , the capital structure of the u.s. health care system , which i think is fundamentally broken .
gw : well , no .
it can save over 600,000 children every year .
why aren 't people washing their hands ?
just for a minute , imagine when they put all their forces behind a message as powerful as handwashing with soap .
i urge you to take five minutes and look at those films .
it 's the most beautiful invention in public health .
dinosaur evolution proceeded at a stately pace , an order of magnitude slower on any way you want to measure it .
this is sort of a nice helicopter ride through those early beds , and they 're located in northeastern argentina .
i 've been to some of those continents , but africa was , in the words of steven pinker , was a blank slate , largely .
we 're talking about ethiopia , but let 's talk about niger -- or niger , in our english language -- north of nigeria -- that 's where this photograph was taken .
this is the first skeleton from a southern continent , and guess what ? you start preparing it .
i got the back legs .
it depended on the shape of their skull , though , so we had to actually get those measurements to be sure that we had reconstructed and could prove to the scientific world that supercroc in fact is a 40-foot crocodile , probably a male .
and the fourth thing is that you actually did one or the other of those three things , but the paleontologist never found you .
several teachers nearly killed me .
and a more general question for our society is , what 's going to happen to all the rest that are left behind ?
the next step is to learn the capability to make yourself a scientist .
so how easily could i swap our unwanted copy of " 24 " for a wanted copy of " sex and the city ? "
i call this " groundswell collaborative consumption . "
all of this was going through my head towards the end of 2008 , when , of course , the great financial crash happened .
i bet , in a couple of years , that phrases like " coworking " and " couchsurfing " and " time banks " are going to become a part of everyday vernacular .
so this is where car-sharing companies such as zipcar and goget come in .
this represents an eight-year time span .
lockers left open like teenage boys ' mouths when teenage girls wear clothes that covers their insecurities but exposes everything else .
but what you 're going to find eventually is you may need to actually get elected officials to help you out .
yes , contributions actually do make a difference and they set a context for having a conversation , but it takes some time to build up .
they don 't spend a lot of time dicking around .
so , you send the copy to the main office .
as a new father , i have a qualitatively different sense of just how delicate babies are , what our obligations are towards them and how much love we can feel towards a child .
but , every so often , we come across children who show some residual vision , and that is a very good sign that the condition might actually be treatable .
here 's an article in nature that profiled this work , and another one in time .
when you ask them , " even if you can 't name the objects , just point to where the objects are , " these are the regions that they point to .
doctor : what are these things ?
as some of you might know , babyies are born pretty much legally blind .
the efficiency of the use of dynamic information seems to be significantly compromised in autism .
and this pressure forces the seawater through a membrane .
we 're all very aware .
enormous innovation , enormous energy , enormous talent now has been mobilized through this structure to try to deal with all of these challenges .
we can 't make a large-scale impact on these problems .
the resources are overwhelmingly generated by business .
the conventional wisdom in economics and the view in business has historically been that actually , there 's a tradeoff between social performance and economic performance .
it makes the business more productive and efficient .
this is what i call shared value : addressing a social issue with a business model .
thank you .
and you were walking along and you were handing the lollipops out to people in line and talking about shinerama .
and every single one of you , every single one of you has been the catalyst for a lollipop moment .
here in brazil , they collect 90 percent of all the waste that 's actually recycled .
and then they receive safety items , too : reflective tapes , horns and mirrors .
we were expected to define ourselves at such an early age , and if we didn 't do it , others did it for us .
see , they asked me what i wanted to be , then told me what not to be .
one of the first lines of poetry i can remember writing was in response to a world that demanded i hate myself .
i saw no reason to lie .
he was a broken branch grafted onto a different family tree , adopted , not because his parents opted for a different destiny .
they have to be wrong .
and doctors hate it , right ?
so that was the low-fear group .
so i want to isolate this , because it was a great observation -- 30 years ago , right , 30 years ago -- and it 's one that 's laid fallow in research .
okay , i know where i sit . i know where i 'm situated .
we should take our foot off the pedal right now , and generally we do . these things are shown to be pretty effective in terms of getting people to slow down .
this is a bankrupt effort at communicating health information .
blood test results are this great source of information .
all those other values , all those pages and pages of values that are full of nothing , we summarize .
now a lot of our effort on this one -- as many of you probably know , a psa test is a very controversial test .
but you can create your own feedback loop .
in the last 100 years alone , our country -- and this is a sprawl map of america -- our country has systematically flattened and homogenized the landscape to the point where we 've forgotten our relationship with the plants and animals that live alongside us and the dirt beneath our feet .
another set of views of actually the gowanus canal itself .
this image is an image of an oyster cart , which is now as ubiquitous as the hotdog cart is today .
and that grows over time dynamically with the threat of climate change .
and the answer is : not yet , they 're working .
and she told all the other people , and she said , " how could it possibly be that something that 's cheap and simple works as well as something that 's complicated and expensive ? "
and what i 'd like to talk to you about today is some of the evidence why i believe this to be true : that for children two years old and up , there really is no real benefit -- proven benefit -- of car seats , in spite of the incredible energy that has been devoted toward expanding the laws and making it socially unacceptable to put your children into seatbelts . and then talk about why -- what is it that makes that true ?
and the standard error bands are relatively small around these estimates as well .
we can 't risk alienating them by testing seatbelts relative to car seats . "
and so this is a test that 's very much rigged in favor of the car seat , ok ? so , that kid in this crash fared very well .
and i just think that it 's interesting that the idea of using real-world crashes , which is very much something that economists think would be the right thing to do , is something that scientists don 't actually , usually think -- they would rather use a laboratory , a very imperfect science of looking at the dummies , than actually 30 years of data of what we 've seen with children and with car seats .
and it turned out that most people wouldn 't come back , because it worked . but every once in a while , there was still a patient convinced that he was sick , and he 'd come back . and my dad had a third jar of pills .
chromosome one , top left .
and that 200 is going to change to 600 this summer , and there 's no sign of this pace slowing .
she goes into respiratory failure and dies eight days later .
today it 's $ 10,000 . next year it 's $ 1,000 .
none , not one .
so anybody who 's here today with your significant other , just turn over to them and swab their mouth , send it to the lab and you 'll know for sure .
but maybe it 's a bad thing as well .
i can 't believe in the doctrines .
now education is a field the secular world really believes in .
why ? they don 't think we need it .
what 's the difference between a sermon and our modern , secular mode of delivery , the lecture ?
the other things that religions do is to arrange time .
that 's very good .
so in orthodox jewish communities , every friday you go to a mikveh .
art is about two things in all the major faiths .
the people in the modern world , in the secular world , who are interested in matters of the spirit , in matters of the mind , in higher soul-like concerns , tend to be isolated individuals .
now we may not agree with what religions are trying to teach us , but we can admire the institutional way in which they 're doing it .
you can get shot by the hard-headed atheists , and you can get shot by those who fully believe .
atheism shouldn 't cut itself off from the rich sources of religion .
alain , thank you for sparking many conversations later .
i mean , i want games to be a force for good in the world .
they help us stay connected with people in our social network that we would otherwise grow distant from , if we weren 't playing games together .
for me that meant no reading , no writing , no video games , no work or email , no running , no alcohol , no caffeine .
now it wasn 't a miracle cure for the headaches or the cognitive symptoms .
but scientists now know that a traumatic event doesn 't doom us to suffer indefinitely .
we 're going to play a quick game together .
we know from the scientific research that willpower actually works like a muscle .
all right , pick one , last quest : shake someone 's hand for six seconds , or send someone a quick thank you by text , email , facebook or twitter . go !
you still have your special mission , your secret mission .
our core project is a rather ambitious folly -- i suppose , a mythic undertaking : to build a 10,000-year clock that can really keep good time for that long a period .
underground in a place that 's really solid .
and now let 's look at the grand truth of what 's there .
ok , back to danny 's list .
they 're the world 's oldest living thing .
this is one of the mines . it doesn 't have any beryllium in it .
they don 't quite meet .
so you can scratch lincoln canyon as an approach .
in fact , there he is . that 's alexander rose .
and that 's also timberline and those bristlecones really are shrubs .
in fact , there are artesian wells where water springs right into the air .
most of the amazingness of the clock we can borrow from the amazingness of the mountain .
so all of this is pretty innovative , if you consider that the hurdy-gurdy appeared about a thousand years ago and it took two people to play it ; one to turn the crank , and another person -- yes -- to play the melody by physically pulling up large wooden pegs .
but what actually happened when he signed the contract -- and by the way , he didn 't want to sign that contract , he wanted to go to college -- which is what my mother , who actually does love me , said that i should do too , and i did -- well , he didn 't do very well . he struggled mightily .
and so is it any wonder , given all of the costs and the side effects of the drugs that we 're using to treat these preconditions , that every year we 're spending more than two trillion dollars on healthcare and yet 100,000 people a year -- and that 's a conservative estimate -- are dying not because of the conditions they have , but because of the treatments that we 're giving them and the complications of those treatments ?
pre-vivor is what a particular cancer advocacy group would like everyone who just has a risk factor , but hasn 't actually had that cancer , to call themselves .
and it actually took being a journalist to understand all these incentives . you know , economists like to say , there are no bad people , there are just bad incentives .
and by the use of pitching powerpoints to vcs , i have personally raised tens of millions of dollars from vcs through powerpoint pitches .
so the most important thing is integrity .
i mean , i want you to have domain expertise .
because bad things happen .
so think about your pitch as a timeline .
any time you go backwards , any time you skip a step -- imagine walking up a staircase where some of the treads are missing , or the heights are different heights .
" we have no competition . there 's nobody else who 's ever made a widget like this . "
oh , isn 't that funny ! there 's another great one over here .
and then , you come back to me .
so there you go -- walk me through , show me who your management team is .
there has never been a company that doesn 't have competition .
this is where you tell me how much you actually want to get .
now , in the process of doing this over here , how do you remember the sequences and doers ?
no , you haven 't . why not ?
now i happen to make my living these days in television , so for me , that 's a good thing .
we love to watch tv .
and for the way in which i 'm going to present the data , i want to thank ted community superstar hans rosling , who you may have just seen .
but in this case , we have comfort -- the bubble in red -- social commentary and irreverence in blue and green .
now look at this .
whether or not you 're in my business , you have surely heard or read of the decline of the thing called the three-camera sitcom and the rise of reality tv .
that 's all great , right ?
jim axelrod : forget the empire state building or the statue of liberty .
j the ramps are made of simple material -- the kind of plywood you see at construction sites -- which is really the whole point .
were you conscious of suddenly -- as a designer whose work is all about fulfilling wants -- suddenly fulfilling needs ?
it was predominantly a white , rich , corporate group that was not representative of the city .
at the same time the city had this need .
and atlantic-heydt , who 's the largest scaffolding contractor in the country , volunteered to do it at cost .
there was no thought of abandoning ship at that point ?
this is clearly not a work for the ages .
dr : well , i think one thing that shouldn 't be done is evaluate -- i think right now the discussion is a very closed discussion on the master plan .
dr : right . and we 're looking for other things .
but the kind of virtually instantaneous nature of its erection , and its being there , almost before you could believe that a response of this magnitude could be accomplished , is part of its extraordinary -- i don 't know if beauty is the word -- but presence .
the only assistance i need from you , which i know you would do for me , are the following : one , be a silent partner and receive the funds in your account in trust ; two , provide a bank account under your control to which the funds will be remitted ; three , receive the funds into your account in trust ; take out your commission ; and leave the rest of the money until i arrive , after the transfer is complete .
and i was like , " get the fuck out of here . that 's crazy . "
four years later , i still get probably two or three hundred emails a day from people i don 't know , and it 's been an amazing opportunity to kind of get to know different cultures , you know ?
in case you run over time .
i 'm hoping it 's going to do well this year .
in other words , it 's a helping tool .
here 's what i mean . politics and -- let 's focus on the political system in particular question here , which is the system of democracy .
and the goals from the perspective of muslims are , in principle , peace , justice and equality , but on terms that correspond to traditional muslim teachings .
there are a wide range of different things that islam can mean .
that 's an academic question .
and that 's a transformation in which many sincerely believing muslims -- who care very , very deeply about their traditions , who do not want to compromise those values -- believe , through the malleability of the technology of democracy and the malleability and synthetic capability of the technology of islam , that these two ideas can work together .
that 's a hopeful message , but it 's a message that 's hopeful only if you understand it as incurring serious obligation for all of us .
he didn 't recognize that at the time , and he contracted leukemia , and he died at the age of 45 .
this was right about the time that i was offered a position here at berkeley , and when i got here , i looked up hubert dreyfus , who 's a world-renowned professor of philosophy , and i talked with him about this , and he said , " this is one of the oldest and most central problems in philosophy . it goes back to the skeptics , and up through descartes .
and she said they hadn 't .
so here 's what it looks like when the robot , this is what the robot 's path looks like , those three examples .
maybe it runs in the family .
and i really kind of want them to be presented in a way to where kids can kind of explore and discover their own principles .
now , we actually play through many generations here , at the cellular scale .
so , for instance , i might put some limbs on the character here .
how it might show emotions , how it might fight .
this world was actually extracted from the player 's imagination .
and our cities are going to be at risk too , because a lot of these are coastal cities .
here it is , some indigenous life down here .
but we also have stars and things as well .
but there 's a great difference between an escalope and my wife , for instance .
now it is quoted in the stock exchange .
by the way , there 's a program on mtv already in which seduction teachers treat heartache as a disease .
but rest assured : so are you .
i 'm going to discuss with you three of my inventions that can have an effect on 10 to a 100 million people , which we will hope to see happen .
so we have to try these devices out because the fda won 't just let us use them on people unless we try it out first , and the best model for this happens to be pigs .
well , on the left is the imd , which is implantable medical device , and tonight in the tent you can see it -- they 've exhibited it .
your rhythm becomes irregular , and that 's what happened 45 minutes later .
we 've called the ambulance . the ambulance is on the way .
in the middle , our experimentalist , the neurologist , who said , " i 'm going to move this down a little and i 'm going to erase half your aura . "
and this is the first device that we did , and i 'm going to talk about my second wish , which has something to do with this .
in the blue wire , we see what 's called a deep brain electrode .
a signal in the brain that triggers brain dysfunction might be sensed as a trigger for electro-stimulation like we 're doing with epilepsy .
as a starting point for discussion with the ted group , a major part of the problem is the nature of the written extent of informed consent that the patient or spouse must read and sign .
i wish i had more wishes but three is what i 've got and there they are .
at each meeting , there 's way too many ideas .
when we submitted it for the swedish competition we thought it was a really cool scheme , but it didn 't exactly look like something from the north of sweden .
you 're not supposed to fly on holidays because it 's bad for the environment .
a third of all the people commute by bike .
you 'll walk around , start looking for a bicycle on the roof , jump on your ride and then continue out into the rest of the expo .
trying to zigzag it to make sure that all of the apartments look at the straight views , instead of into each other .
and there is an automatic irrigation system that makes sure that this sort of landscape of gardens , in one or two years it will sort of transform into a cambodian temple ruin , completely covered in green .
then we place these mountains on the island , surrounding this sort of central green valley , almost like a central park .
for some reason it explodes , and you begin to get these things .
and as you 're thinking about that , what happens is you get more and more complexity , more and more stuff to build new things with .
and as you 're thinking about this , you might also ask the question : so why a single human species ?
he was darwin 's cousin .
you already saw the work by tony atala on ted , but this ability to start filling things like inkjet cartridges with cells are allowing us to print skin , organs and a whole series of other body parts .
you can tag them with proteins that light up when you light them .
and this is only one of the conditions that 's out there .
here 's the bottom line .
what zipcar does is we park cars throughout dense urban areas for members to reserve , by the hour and by the day , instead of using their own car .
maybe i would have bought the ice cream when i did some other errand . "
and it 's the cost of driving that 's making people want to be able to do this .
and wireless technologies make this real-time loop possible .
when the hurricane happened , the only communication system standing was the mesh network .
i guess i just want you to think about that .
imagine if every one of these buses in lagos was part of the mesh network .
i also make drawings to help people understand things .
maybe that line of text could be a story to help give some human aspect to this .
this gives me a chance to suggest to you the structure of the column of marcus aurelius , which is really no more than a pile of quarters high -- thick quarters . over the piazza of saint ignacio , completely ruining the symmetry , but that aside a spectacular place to visit .
so , the alarm goes off and it 's five to 12 or so .
enters the courtyard and talks to the custodian , who tells him that there 's been a disaster in the palazzo ; nobody 's tvs are working and there 's a big soccer game coming up , and the crowd is getting a little restless and a little nervous .
adaptations all get buried under the stucco .
i mean , if a title works , use it . but it would be a journey that went through rome and showed all the things that i like about rome .
and the pigeon is flying down above the appian way here .
we get a little exuberant as we pass gesu ; it 's not surprising to sort of mimic the architecture in this way .
and all of a sudden i passed the national examination , found myself in a very beautiful high school in kenya .
so , this was told to me in a setup of elders .
so as i continue to be a member of parliament and as i continue listening to all of you talking about botany , talking about health , talking about democracy , talking about new inventions , i 'm hoping that one day in my own little community -- which is 26,000 square kilometers , maybe five times the size of rhode island -- with no roads , we 'll be able to become a model to help others develop .
the vietnam protests , the commemoration of all that died in the pandemic of aids , the march for women 's reproductive rights , right up until almost the present .
and for this new initiative , the hirshhorn would have to expand or appropriate a site for a contemporary , deployable structure .
most are neoclassical , heavy and opaque , made of stone or concrete .
so you might have been wondering how in the world did we get this approved by the federal government .
there 's one permanent steel ring at the top , but it can 't be seen from any vantage point on the mall .
this is a very , very unusual building in that there 's no gravity load , but there 's load in every direction .
and i 'm not really going to talk much about the economy .
we didn 't see anything like that in africa .
and the way that i 'm going to do that is , i 'm going to look across areas with different levels of malaria .
so the other thing that i think we learn here is that aids is not going to fix itself .
so this is a problem for policy . it was a problem for my research .
but this also tells us that one of these facts that i mentioned in the beginning may not be quite right .
more exports means more aids . and that effect is really big .
so if you combine the intuition in this figure with some of the data that i talked about before , it suggests that somewhere between 25 percent and 50 percent of the decline in prevalence in uganda actually would have happened even without any education campaign .
i would run into the living room , jump up on the couch , rip the cushions off , throw them on the floor , scream at the top of my lungs and run out because i was the incredible hulk .
that is when i realized that i was not the incredible hulk .
and then chris sacca , who is now a dear friend mine , had completed an iron man with 103 degree temperature , said , " i have the answer to your prayers . "
so you don 't kick . but you do use a small flick .
then i transferred to a different school sophomore year , and i had a choice of other languages . most of my friends were taking japanese .
there had been something lost in translation .
from that point , you can then , if you want to , acquire multiple languages , alternate them so there is no interference .
so i did my best . i didn 't know where to put my hands .
these seemed to be the three areas that i could exploit to compete if i wanted to comptete against people who 'd been practicing for 20 to 30 years .
i have hundreds of hours of footage -- all categorized , much like george carlin categorized his comedy .
the energy crisis was in full bore .
and then in 1983 , lotus 1-2-3 came out , and i was completely blown away by lotus 1-2-3 .
a lot of people are working on things to try and reduce that , but i didn 't have anything to contribute in that area .
and this is the shape that evolved .
james watt didn 't actually invent the steam engine , he just refined it .
i want to give you a brief explanation of how we looked at it and how it works .
so , now you 're not alternately heating and cooling the metal , you 're just alternately heating and cooling the air .
if you put electricity in , this will get hot and this will get cold , you get refrigeration .
and you also get hot water .
pretty much everywhere that 's not green or blue is a really ideal place , but even the green or blue areas are good , just not as good as the places that are red , orange and yellow .
there 's 10,000 watts of light pouring on the stage , one horsepower is 756 watts , at full power .
and the living self-portrait series was the idea of basically my being a brush in the hand of amazing people who would come and i would interview .
this is somewhat against resistance and caginess on the part of the interviewee .
so i thought , okay , fine , i 've got empathy , or empathy , at any rate , is what 's critical to this kind of interview .
so , you know , you want energy , you want the life force , but you really want them also to think that they have a story worth sharing .
it 'll be your generational determinant as to whether her name means much to you .
now i 'm her competitor for the audience .
then at a certain moment , the door opened and she walked out perfectly dressed , completely composed .
so , he was very satisfied with the kind of relationship they had over 50 years .
she lived in new york .
and she had to go along just to be with her sister for company , and in that process , she made a number of decisions .
a step after that is a project on fungible computers .
von neumann , in the ' 50s , did the same thing for computing ; he showed you can have an unreliable computer but restore its state to make it perfect . this was the last great analog computer at mit : a differential analyzer , and the more you ran it , the worse the answer got .
but the first day of class looked like this .
you don 't need this for what you can get in wal-mart ; you need this for what makes you unique .
there was a girl who insisted we stay late at night -- : kids : i love the fab lab .
these fab labs are the cost and complexity of a pdp .
it breaks every organizational boundary we can think of .
that one is a naked biped . why ?
so we 're left with a situation where we know that our earliest ancestors were moving around on four legs in the trees , before the savanna ecosystem even came into existence .
so that is what they have done now .
and at that time , it became set in stone : the aquatic theory should be dumped with the ufos and the yetis , as part of the lunatic fringe of science .
you can 't say all aquatic animals are naked , because look at the sea otter .
and the gorilla can 't speak . why ?
of course they don 't believe it , but they like it . "
the second thing that could happen is that some young genius will arrive , and say , " i 've found it .
the textbooks don 't mention it .
white had been enormously helpful to me , and the thought of his leaving shattered me .
fortunately , i did not actually enact that grave prognosis .
this person is likely to have some form of schizophrenia .
i don 't believe in joints , but they do hold your body together . ' " -- it 's an example of loose associations . -- " eventually i made my way back to my dorm room , and once there , i couldn 't settle down .
every week in the united states , it 's been estimated that one to three people die in restraints .
all around me i sensed evil beings poised with daggers .
i could no longer deny the truth , and i could not change it .
please , continue to let us see characters in your movies , your plays , your columns , who suffer with severe mental illness .
having made that decision they came to the united states , home of liberal arts education , to talk with some of us most closely identified with that kind of education .
in so doing , the guardians of secular democracy in effect yield the connection between education and values to fundamentalists , who , you can be sure , have no compunctions about using education to further their values : the absolutes of a theocracy .
equally startling , from my point of view , is the fact that no one was drawing any connections between what is happening to the body politic , and what is happening in our leading educational institutions .
the importance of coming to grips with values like justice , equity , truth , becomes increasingly evident as students discover that interest alone cannot tell them what they need to know when the issue is rethinking education , our approach to health , or strategies for achieving an economics of equity .
this discovery is transforming .
but this single-mindedness will not yield the flexibilities of mind , the multiplicity of perspectives , the capacities for collaboration and innovation this country needs .
and he knew me , so i was like , " greg ? "
michael moriarty : specialist michael moriarty .
mm : they 're shooting at me .
he served -- -- with the marines , and i want to tell you a little , brief story .
but there were 3,211 emails and ims and text messages that i was able to save .
sp : sheriff one-six , or any one-four elements , we need you at the gate of taji right now , over .
if one of those incompetent medical officers told me to stop treatment , i would 've slit his throat right there .
so , i pinged mike and i said , " mike , can you please go get that interview with pink ? "
so , when you may hear soldiers complaining , that 's what they 're talking about , you know ?
he 's a big guy .
you go and see anybody ?
and " beatjazzers " become as common as d.j. ' s .
and guess what ?
one third of it , in fact , is genetic .
as i lost so much , i finally started to find myself . "
you may discover , as i did , that a lot of things that you used to think were your fault , a lot of things you used to think about yourself , really had nothing to do with you .
women start off whole , don 't we ?
these were being sold for about 2,000 dollars each , and they are used for bear paw soup , and also being trained , later on , to become dancing bears like the one you just saw .
and now he sells cool drinks , he 's by the highway .
we 've been able to ensure better futures for the people and the bears .
now this is because the pollen within a tomato flower is held very securely within the male part of the flower , the anther , and the only way to release this pollen is to vibrate it .
my personal favorite , and one that i 've studied for many years , is their system of healthcare .
we 're down to about two million hives of bees , we think .
this small bee is holding up a large mirror .
these bees are providing backup for our honeybees .
so the beauty of helping bees this way , for me , is that every one of us needs to behave a little bit more like a bee society , an insect society , where each of our individual actions can contribute to a grand solution , an emergent property , that 's much greater than the mere sum of our individual actions .
1968 , i put out the whole earth catalog . was " mister natural " for a while .
and this is why .
now they 're showing us how they do their phone service .
we should be able to make that choice easier for them to get toward the legitimate world , because if we don 't , they will go toward the criminal world .
more than half .
we 're going to keep being surprised . and almost all the surprises are going to be bad ones .
just ask the coal miners in australia .
and that 's why 10 percent of the electricity in this room , 20 percent of electricity in this room is probably nuclear .
and as those events keep happening we 're going to say , " okay , what can we do about that really ? "
thank you .
and then , like everyone else in our generation , we went to live in a himalayan monastery .
day one , day two , day three , day four , day five , day six .
and india was the place where smallpox made its last stand .
it was the largest campaign in united nations history until the iraq war .
and we conducted the first nepal survey ever done for health , and the first nationwide blindness survey ever done , and we had astonishing results .
but much worse than that , 90 percent said they thought there 'd be a pandemic within your children or your grandchildren 's lifetime .
and that simulation that i showed you that you thought was bird flu -- that was sars . and sars is the pandemic that did not occur .
let 's make it transparent , non-governmental , not owned by any single country or company , housed in a neutral country , with redundant backup in a different time zone and a different continent , and let 's build it on gphin . let 's start with gphin .
and because of that we were able to stop sars .
so this year we 're going to visualize how the brain visualizes .
and this is deep inside of the brain . it 's very old , evolutionarily .
secondly make those images interactive so that we engage much more fully .
the first again , is making ideas clear by visualizing them .
it 's a self-portrait titled " wide hips . "
there was no language to translate this ancient , idiosyncratic handcraft into something machine operators could produce .
i couldn 't build this with a steel ring , the way i knew .
i 'm a bug lover , myself -- not from childhood , by the way , but rather late .
what is a pest ?
by the way , with aphids you have only females , like amazons .
again , in your backyard , in your backyard .
this adult pierces the thrips , sucking it within just several minutes , just going to the other prey , continuing all over the place .
you see this ampoule . you see this one .
number two , many growers are in fact petrified from the idea of resistance , that the pests will become resistant to the chemicals , just in our case that bacteria becomes resistant to antibiotics .
and thirdly , also to increase awareness by the growers to the potential of this industry .
sixty-eight rich men on the steamer portland . stacks of yellow metal .
in the gold rush , people literally jumped ship .
and you know , without the smell that would have accompanied that , we had the same thing on the internet : very bad burn rate calculations .
it 's not a specific thing .
well , it was because that heavy infrastructure had already been laid down .
now , the toaster was huge because they used to make toast on open fires , and it took a lot of time and attention .
that was to come much later -- the off switch on appliances -- because it didn 't make any sense .
and that 's assuming you already have dsl in your house .
and in 1917 , sears -- i want to get this exactly right .
and , you see , this era coincided with my own childhood .
and i was really good at school .
remember that moment ? it felt so good , didn 't it ?
now , i was saying , well , that 's the whole point : it 's moving .
and after this i wanted to build a computer out of people , called a human-powered computer .
i did this ad . i don 't believe in this kind of alcohol , but i do drink sometimes .
this was a moment where i was thinking about , so , you have a computer program , it responds to motion -- x and y -- and i realized that each computer program has all these images inside the program .
i began to be very disinterested in computers themselves , so i began to make paintings out of palmpilots .
we think we 'll go to a museum ; that 's where all the tastes are .
so , three years ago i discovered , the letters m-i-t occurring in simplicity and complexity .
and if anything , i think risd has a strange dna .
and already , commercial oyster larvae are dying at large scales in some places .
it 's really messy .
well , some people say there are oil plumes .
i heard the most incredible story today when i was on the train coming here .
they get in the gulf stream . they go all the way to europe .
i saw birds that breed in greenland in the gulf , so this is a hemispheric issue .
all they 're doing is stirring it .
it turns out that -- you see this sign on almost every commercial vessel in the united states -- you know , if you spilled a couple of gallons of oil , you would be in big trouble .
the glass-steagall act -- which was really to protect us from the kind of thing that caused the recession to happen , and the bank meltdown and all that stuff that required the bailouts -- that was put in effect in 1933 , was systematically destroyed .
thank you very much .
what it doesn 't help them do is to learn word patterns .
and it struck me that maybe this is what i was looking for .
so this is the word " tell . "
i was trying out so many different combinations of this .
and i built an app out of it , a game out of it , in which children can play with words and with a reinforcement , a sound reinforcement of visual structures , they 're able to learn language .
instead they 're processing the data structure of thought .
we have so many different languages .
i understand the world best , most fully , in words rather than , say , pictures or numbers , and when i have a new experience or a new feeling , i 'm a little frustrated until i can try to put it into words .
now — for a breath i tarry nor yet disperse apart — take my hand quick and tell me , what have you in your heart .
the red that means fertility can also mean poison .
" brave " has its old sense of showy as well as its modern sense , courage .
" this living hand , now warm and capable of earnest grasping , would , if it were cold and in the icy silence of the tomb , so haunt thy days and chill thy dreaming nights that thou would wish thine own heart dry of blood so in my veins red life might stream again , and thou be conscience-calm 'd -- see here it is -- i hold it towards you . "
after 30 days of sleepless nights , she finally capitulated and raised the grade .
but the direct costs are really only the tip of the iceberg .
what does the macro-data show us ?
and what happens when the teacher tries to assert order ?
i grew up in the south and whiled away the summers fishing .
self-consciousness is the enemy of accomplishment .
all these choices involve value judgments and social norms , not objective facts .
but it 's a hard hurdle because we got into this legal quicksand because we woke up in the 1960s to all these really bad values : racism , gender discrimination , pollution -- they were bad values . and we wanted to create a legal system where no one could have bad values anymore .
and if you look at the chart for 2050 , it 's projected that the chinese economy will be twice the size of the american economy , and the indian economy will be almost the same size as the american economy .
we can 't .
the first is that the most important political value for the chinese is unity , is the maintenance of chinese civilization .
it doesn 't work .
the problem with this proposition is that the chinese state enjoys more legitimacy and more authority amongst the chinese than is true with any western state .
private firms , however large they are , like lenovo , depend in many ways on state patronage .
in many ways , it 's the most parochial , because for 200 years , the west has been so dominant in the world that it 's not really needed to understand other cultures , other civilizations .
and at last , i 'm afraid -- take europe ; america is slightly different -- but europeans by and large , i have to say , are ignorant , are unaware about the way the world is changing .
i think there will be good things about it and there will be bad things about it .
america suddenly was swept up by hysteria .
but to five-year-old me , i thought it was kind of nice that they 'd lit the way for me to pee .
i had read civics books that told me about the ideals of american democracy .
they were put into a segregated all japanese-american unit and sent to the battlefields of europe , and they threw themselves into it .
they clung to their belief in the shining ideals of this country , and they proved that being an american is not just for some people , that race is not how we define being an american .
so for all domestic needs , women have to carry water .
we are fighting against this .
so no water is stored . it 's always on tap .
for india and such developing countries , armies and armaments , software companies and spaceships may not be as important as taps and toilets .
and the rate at which the arctic sea ice is going away is a lot quicker than models .
they will completely lose .
so you can 't step on the brakes very quickly .
the one new thing is this essay .
there are a lot of fun complexities that i 'd love to spend the whole evening on , but i won 't .
and the box has two knobs .
so here 's one way to think about it , which is that we just do this instead of cutting emissions because it 's cheaper .
but maybe on that day we also find that the greenland ice sheet is really melting unacceptably fast , fast enough to put meters of sea level on the oceans in the next 100 years , and remove some of the biggest cities from the map .
i think there is a serious problem : as you talk about this , people begin to think they don 't need to work so hard to cut emissions .
a creationist pamphlet has this wonderful page in it : " test two : do you know of any building that didn 't have a builder ? yes / no .
and there 's nothing intrinsically sexy about these young ladies .
and , by the way , a recent study shows that mothers prefer the smell of the dirty diapers of their own baby .
it happened 225 years ago .
it has a fairly substantial number of asteroids between the orbit of the earth out through -- to the orbit of jupiter .
it 's quite likely that it would move out of the ocean onto the surface , just as it did on the earth .
and the regular astronomers were scornful about this .
and then , when you shine sunlight at them , the sunlight will be reflected back , just as it is in the eyes of an animal .
so , i hope in the next 10 years , we 'll find these creatures , and then , of course , our whole view of life in the universe will change .
people getting kidnapped , where the oil comes from , the oil that sometimes i think has driven us all crazy in nigeria .
now that is less than a year old , in an operating room .
these are a few of them . so , what did i do ?
but we had problems with it . we had severe problems there .
we did 12 open-heart surgical patients successfully .
is it dental surgery you want ? general surgery you want ?
i don 't think anyone in this room would disagree .
that was our task .
i want you all to select one of the houses of the 25 houses you see on the screen .
those ticks and crosses represent the 7,800 houses we 've looked at nationally around australia , the same proportion .
i think there 's an obvious question that i hope you 're thinking about .
it 's a developing world illness , and yet , the picture you see behind is in an aboriginal community in the late 1990s where 95 percent of school-aged kids had active trachoma in their eyes doing damage .
when the bug was in the gut , he 'd send back by return post some dung beetles .
how do we actually get the smoke down ? so two problems , and design should be about more than one thing .
none of those are limited by geography , by skin color or by religion . none of them .
also , three guys working for years in los angeles , an iranian , a palestinian and an egyptian , created the aptly named axis of evil comedy act .
first , the axis guys recorded a comedy central special that aired in the states , and it was getting great hits on youtube .
anywhere you go .
sadly , this leads me to another three bs that represents how the media in the west talks about us as bombers , billionaires and belly dancers .
they 're little . they 're five years old .
but it doesn 't seem to be working .
not necessarily . they might be smart .
so disney can make a new $ 200 million movie that flops , and nobody calls the attorney general .
the puritans came here for religious reasons , or so they said , but they also came here because they wanted to make a lot of money .
but if it 's a logical world in which investment in fundraising actually raises more funds and makes the pie bigger , then we have it precisely backwards , and we should be investing more money , not less , in fundraising , because fundraising is the one thing that has the potential to multiply the amount of money available for the cause that we care about so deeply .
here 's how all of this impacts the big picture .
and i founded my country 's first graphic design and new media college .
and is used to write amharic , which is spoken by over 24 million people .
thank you very much .
and suddenly it was over for me . that 's it .
and your front foot , the way it grabs it , is -- i 'd seen someone slide on the back of the board like that , and i was like , " how can i get it over ? "
you 're on this gurney and you 're watching the ceiling go by , every time it 's always that , and right when they 're putting the mask on you before you go to sleep , all i was thinking is , " man , when i wake up and i get better , the first thing i 'm going to do is film that trick . "
no matter how good you are , right , you still gotta deal with — so you hit this wall , and when i hit it , the first thing you do is you fall forward , and i 'm like , all right , all right .
you can be a linux kernel hacker , make it more stable , right ?
and you get in a car , and you drive away , and 10-minute drive , and you get out , and no one gives a rat 's who you are .
rm : you 'll get a text .
well , i wasn 't so interested in the swimming .
well , i have to tell you something very odd , and that is that being exposed to low oxygen does not always kill .
you know ?
in fact , in chemical accidents , hydrogen sulfide is known to -- if you breathe too much of it , you collapse to the ground , you appear dead , but if you were brought out into room air , you can be reanimated without harm , if they do that quickly .
it 's rapidly metabolized , and all you have to do after six hours of being in this state of de-animation is simply put the thing out in room air , and it warms up , and it 's none the worse for wear .
so , these are the thought leaders in trauma medicine all over the world saying this is true , so it seems that exposure to hydrogen sulfide decreases damage that you receive from being exposed to otherwise lethal-low oxygen .
we hope not , or maybe we just hope to make miracles a little more common .
and we feel like some of that difficulty was because of this false advertisement around parenting .
and i was there with my arms open .
and i think the reality is that love is a process , and i think the problem with thinking of love as something that 's binary is that it causes us to be unduly concerned that love is fraudulent , or inadequate , or what have you .
i felt like i was a vessel of the future of humanity .
this is actually the last little image we have of him .
the party line is that every single aspect of my life has just gotten dramatically better ever since i participated in the miracle that is childbirth and family .
and part of what happens , i think , in your ' 20s and ' 30s , is you start to learn to hedge your happiness .
and so the final question that we would ask is : can we collectively bend that happiness chart upwards ?
and they use motors that literally are used on cruise missile boosters .
voices : no .
what was the whole process in the creation and the evolution of the universe to getting to the point that we have these kinds of materials ?
put the earth at the center of the nested spheres , just because that 's where we 're making observations .
and then there 's a part of the universe we can 't see because it 's so dense and so hot , light can 't escape .
what kind of evidence do we have for that ?
there 's another survey which is very similar to this , called the two-degree field of view galaxy redshift survey .
and that is , you start out with very simple ingredients and some simple rules , but you have to have enough ingredients to make it complicated .
so we 're zooming in .
you see a filament , you see the light is the invisible matter , and the yellow is the stars or the galaxies showing up .
this simulation was run on 1,000 processors for a month in order to make just this simple visible one .
and that design is sort of way beyond what our original imagination ever was .
now , with the topic : there 's a whole range of topics you can choose , but you should choose wisely , because your topic strongly correlates with how users will react to your talk .
you 'll all stay with me .
i hope you enjoy designing your own ultimate and worst possible tedtalks .
i 've seen this firsthand over and over again .
this seems counterintuitive , but turns out that as infant mortality is reduced , population sizes also decrease , because parents don 't need to anticipate that their babies are going to die .
and i said to my parents , " i 've got to go .
and as a result of that experience , in the middle of the week , while i was there in jail , dr. king came and said with our parents , " what you children do this day will have an impact on children who have not been born . "
and robert and jane meyerhoff , philanthropists , said , " we 'd like to help . "
i know . i know . i know .
nice story . give him a hand for that too .
whether you 're talking about artists producing artists or you 're talking about people getting into the social sciences , whatever the discipline -- and especially in science and engineering , as in art , for example -- you need scientists to pull the students into the work .
but now we are looking at redesigning the humanities and social sciences .
he said , " choice , not chance , determines your destiny . "
and my vague rememberings from gcse science -- well , steel comes from iron , so i phoned up an iron mine .
i dragged out this stuff , and it wasn 't iron .
so this is attempting to make potato starch plastic .
tt : yeah , i did plug it in .
right ? well , actually , statistically speaking , if you only visit porn sites , you 're safer .
but it goes further .
which i 've covered in coffee , and i ask the receptionist to plug in this usb key and print me a new one .
this is a script .
now that 's obviously interesting , because that gives us a way of finding our cybercriminals .
it turns out he 's a member of the russian adult webmasters federation .
tedattendees , hyattlb . where do you think i 'm staying ?
would someone be able to abuse it ? "
this is a song that came about because i think it 's difficult to be in the world and not be aware of what 's going on , and the wars and so forth .
today we made a big step forward . "
so if you don 't care for future generations , just go for it .
but this guy doesn 't seem too bad .
if you see someone deeply wounded , great suffering , you might just help out of empathic distress -- you can 't stand it , so it 's better to help than to keep on looking at that person .
and then , also , there he had a choice .
just to give you an idea : this is the meditator at rest on the left , meditator in compassion meditation , you see all the activity , and then the control group at rest , nothing happened , in meditation , nothing happened .
that will take 50,000 years , too much for the environment .
we need caring economics .
but recently , we 've become more and more interested in projects where art and technology intersect , from creating sight-specific audio and video installation to engineering interactive concerts .
when they ask for a c.d. or an mp3 version , we just can 't make that happen , and the reason is because this isn 't a promotional app or a game to promote or accompany the release of a traditional record .
smaller ones don 't have the resources or the expertise , and so there 's this market of western companies who are happy to supply them with the tools and techniques for a price .
gamma is not the only company in the business .
what i thought was most fascinating was they 've actually paid for the coffee break at one of the law enforcement conferences earlier this year .
there 's no law that 's been passed specifically authorizing this technique , and because of its power and potential for abuse , it 's vital that we have an informed public debate .
so for 11 years , i conformed .
oars are not supposed to look like this .
number one that i get asked : what do you eat ?
well , naturally , you decide to row across the pacific .
awful , really awful .
and it took about a week for us to actually gradually converge .
and i try to use this to bring awareness to these environmental issues , to bring a human face to the ocean .
other people will see if you 're in the supermarket line and you pull out your reusable grocery bag .
we can choose a greener future , and we can get there if we all pull together to take it one stroke at a time .
nt : to my delight , i discovered i could visualize my inventions with the greatest facility .
mt : well , maybe you shouldn 't have told them it could be used to contact other planets .
during my visit i 've been especially honored to meet some of britain 's most extraordinary women -- women who are paving the way for all of you .
she 's an active presence in their lives , as well as mine , and is instilling in them the same values that she taught me and my brother : things like compassion , and integrity , and confidence , and perseverance -- all of that wrapped up in an unconditional love that only a grandmother can give .
we all know .
and by getting a good education , you too can control your own destiny .
they call it the oval office .
but what 's even more striking is what 's happening at the very tippy top of the income distribution .
what 's driving it , and what can we do about it ?
but today , that superstar effect is happening across the entire economy .
think about amazon , apple , google , starbucks .
at its zenith , g.m. employed hundreds of thousands , facebook fewer than 10,000 .
we created unions .
it 's about an m.p. called geoffrey dickens .
so , bright guy , could be wrong on that one , i don 't know .
we now think there are likely to be only just over 20,000 genes in the human genome .
but every cell in your body is replaced at some point .
don 't let anyone tell you they understand electricity .
but the point , what i 've got it down to , is there are only two questions really worth asking .
now like with anything that 's really different from the status quo , it didn 't always go so well testing that aircraft .
as a multi-purpose passenger vehicle , it is now officially " designed for occasional off-road use . "
we leverage a lot of technology from the state-of-the-art in general aviation and from automotive racing .
just fold up the wings and keep going .
' my world ' tells us why the sun rises , why we were born .
then the gymnosophist asked , " what are you doing ? "
and if you have lived an extraordinary life , you will be welcomed to elysium , or what the french call " champs-élysées " -- -- the heaven of the heroes .
it was called the vaitarani .
the denominator of the gymnosophist 's life was infinity .
it 's always about taste .
i love mythology too much .
he had an intuitive understanding of the mythic structure of india .
and based on this , we created a ritual for leaders .
who sees it all ?
now , manya , when she encountered the typical customer , would debate with him about his lifestyle , how much he wants to spend , how many children he has , what does he need the car for ?
she said to me , " i needed one month to decide which dress to wear . "
we decoded our genome .
and for me , it 's very shocking to see sometimes very poor people , for example , not supporting the idea of the rich being taxed more .
it really prevented us to think about social change .
that 's where babies were born and people died .
more than half the people now in the world live in cities , and that will just continue to escalate .
and if you look at the data , when you have that kind of a structure , you get a very even distribution of the shops and the physicians and the pharmacies and the cafes in paris .
i went back a couple of weekends ago , took this photograph of these fabulous new bike lanes that they have installed .
you don 't know if it 's going to run you over .
and so we 've been working on a chassis of the wall itself .
in this case , she picks up her phone , she can map food preparation at the kitchen island to a particular location of sunlight . an algorithm will keep it in that location as long as she 's engaged in that activity .
and i suspect many of you probably gave something towards that problem as well , but somehow it doesn 't happen with the same intensity .
there 's only one africa .
bed nets are very cheap .
but these three questions , i can answer them .
imagine you are a mother in udaipur district , rajasthan .
afterwards , the camp -- just having the camp -- increases immunization from six percent to 17 percent .
we can just run an experiment .
but what politicians need is a range of options .
and that 's not bad . for your hundred dollars , you get between one and three extra years of education .
you give your money to doctors without borders , you give your money to partners in health , and they 'll send in the doctors , and they 'll send in the lumber , and they 'll helicopter things out and in .
so we should get started now .
and then two weeks ago yesterday , she posted this .
sorry for the spoiler alert , but no world peace . not yet .
so what about us ? what about our generation , and our media revolution , the internet ?
the programmers come and go .
this is a screenshot from github , the premier git hosting service , and every time a programmer uses git to make any important change at all , creating a new file , modifying an existing one , merging two files , git creates this kind of signature .
it took people another 150 years to even think of the scientific journal , right ? so -- so the harnessing by the invisible college of the printing press to create the scientific journal was phenomenally important , but it didn 't happen big , and it didn 't happen quick , and it didn 't happen fast , so if you 're going to look for where the change is happening , you have to look on the margins .
somebody put a question up on quora saying , " why is it that lawmakers don 't use distributed version control ? "
or are we going to try and take it and press it into service for society at large ?
my father was not going to take his children ; that was one of the reasons we sort of had a falling out for a few years .
nasa had no interest ; they tried to kill the project .
jeff bezos kindly , yesterday , said he 'll put this video up on the amazon site -- some little clip of it .
the sort of artist conceptions : these are basically powerpoint presentations given to the air force 40 years ago .
you could call it tedistan .
then came the end of the cold war .
because in mine-golia , chinese firms operate and own most of the mines -- copper , zinc , gold -- and they truck the resources south and east into mainland china .
again , globalization chinese style .
another pillar of this strategy is diplomacy .
let 's start with iraq .
that is , of course , in palestine .
fortunately for them , most of their oil and gas resources were discovered after the soviet union collapsed .
silk road connotes independence and mutual trust .
that not only helps europe diminish its reliance on russia for energy , but if you travel to north africa today , you 'll hear more and more people saying that they don 't really think of their region as the middle east .
now let 's go up to the arctic circle .
i would say with a great smile , " i will definitely pass . "
you just quit school and come there . "
so this is capturing the trace of a thumbprint because , knowingly or unknowingly , whatever we do , you know , we leave our traces here .
he would say , " for the greater good . "
it 's just captured through from the lamp .
they never wrote back to me .
while i was doing that work , my mom and my dad , they were looking at it and they said , " why do you deal with negative subjects all the time ? "
you know , that 's why the night sky , we see the sky as dark , but it 's filled with light all the time .
you can see the detail .
i was born into a family of politically active , intellectual atheists .
she 's worried .
and it 's to help all of us , myself included , to counteract the tendency to " otherize . "
what issues deeply concern you ?
because ubuntu work is slow , and it 's difficult .
it is used in aerospace and medical equipment as alloys .
it has allowed momentous political change to take place .
sending and receiving letters took months , if you were lucky . often they never arrived .
but curiously , redwood rainforests , the fragments that we have left , to this day remain under-explored .
i became very interested , and i wrote about a couple .
humans appear to be the only primates that i know of that are afraid of heights .
many species of mosses , and then all sorts of lichens just plastering the tree .
there 's the person , right there . the person is waving to us .
canopy soil can occur up to a meter deep , hundreds of feet above the ground , and there are organisms in this soil that have , as yet , no names .
and what we 're seeing is not just the potential death of the eastern hemlock species -- that is to say , its extinction from nature due to this invading parasite -- but we 're also seeing the death of an incredibly complex ecosystem for which these trees are merely the substrate for the aerial labyrinth of the sky that exists in their crowns .
you 've just told us a different story of this tragic arms race that 's happening , and maybe whole ecosystems gone forever .
and by " regretted it , " i mean that i stepped outside of the tattoo place -- this is just a couple miles from here down on the lower east side -- and i had a massive emotional meltdown in broad daylight on the corner of east broadway and canal street .
it 's called a lobotomy .
and most of what we know about regret comes to us out of that domain .
so the first consistent component of regret is basically denial .
so it 's not that i sat there in my bedroom that night , thinking , " make it go away . "
text : relpy to all .
i don 't think that 's the case though .
specifically the two things i learned about myself that i most didn 't want to forget was how important it felt to keep exploring and , simultaneously , how important it is to somehow keep an eye on your own true north .
i mean , people like bill buxton have been playing around with it in the ' 80s .
there 's no manual . this is exactly what you expect , especially if you haven 't interacted with a computer before .
now this is going to be really important as we start getting to things like data visualization . for instance , i think we all really enjoyed hans rosling 's talk , and he really emphasized the fact that i 've been thinking about for a long time too : we have all this great data , but for some reason , it 's just sitting there .
i mean , this technique of being able to manipulate a mesh here , with multiple control points , is actually something that 's state of the art .
and so , what i 'd like to do now is to tell you about what we 've learned in those journeys .
and maybe most important , they have a big effect on other companies .
those of us who care about all this would act better if we knew what the real costs were .
here 's a story about national policy that we could all learn from .
every year a million and a half people die of a completely preventable disease . that 's malaria . 6,000 people a day .
in 2005 , there were 600 million dollars invested in new technologies of the sort you see here . it doubled in 2006 to 1.2 billion dollars .
and if it 's business as usual , we 're going out of business .
it could be bigger than wal-mart .
now how many previous offenses do you think they have on average managed to commit ?
do you want to also help government find whether there 's a better economic model , not just leaving these guys to come out of prison and waiting till they re-offend and putting them back in again , but actually working with them to move to a different path to end up with fewer crimes and fewer victims ?
so children in the state care tend to do very badly .
so taking peterborough as an example , we add case management across all of the different organizations that we 're working with so they know what actually has been done with different prisoners , and at the same time they learn from the ministry of justice , and we learn , because we pushed for the data , what actually happens , whether they get re-arrested or not .
this map -- -- this map shows the number of seconds that american network and cable news organizations dedicated to news stories , by country , in february of 2007 -- just one year ago .
and they , in fact , covered the same 24 news events .
life expectancy has gone up by about 25 years .
so what will this do ?
these will be redundant concepts . and this isn 't only something of the west .
how do we think about complex systems in new ways ?
and so i say that i want to build a game layer on top of the world , but that 's not quite true because it 's already under construction ; it 's already happening .
they 've created this thing called the open graph , and they own all of our connections .
and so today , i 'm going to show you four , because i hope to have a competitive advantage at the end of this , still .
they will return like clockwork at different times .
i don 't know . i don 't have a black card ; i 've got a debit card .
this is used all over the place , including linkedin , where i am an un-whole individual .
the final one i want to talk about -- and it 's a great one to end on -- is this concept of communal discovery , a dynamic in which everyone has to work together to achieve something .
this next decade is the decade of games .
so , can i build time machines ?
i can consider it is actually a log book which is representative of many journeys of that period .
they are well structured in many cases .
" how much will it cost ? "
it 's really a question of scale .
it 's become the dominant school of thought in computer science .
foldit recently made a notable and major scientific discovery by deciphering the structure of the mason-pfizer monkey virus .
or take another example : big data .
to some , this has terrifying privacy and civil liberties implications . to others it foretells of an era of greater privacy and civil liberties protections , but privacy and civil liberties are of fundamental importance .
for example , they charged saudi foreign fighters substantially more than libyans , money that would have otherwise gone to al qaeda .
when they passed go , they collected twice the salary , and they got to roll both dice instead of one , so they got to move around the board a lot more .
pp : okay , so no surprises , people are onto us .
and what my colleagues and i for the last seven years have been doing is studying the effects of these kinds of hierarchies .
we 've even studied cars , not just any cars , but whether drivers of different kinds of cars are more or less inclined to break the law .
but over the last 20 years , that significant difference has become a grand canyon of sorts between those at the top and everyone else .
and there 's the giving pledge , in which more than 100 of our nation 's wealthiest individuals are pledging half of their fortunes to charity .
like the verb " to wed " that you see here has become regular .
companies like google have digitized many of them -- above 20 million actually .
i don 't necessarily think the film is so interesting .
how do we reconfigure it ?
the idea that art can actually evaluate the relationship between what it means to be in a picture , and what it means to be in a space . what is the difference ?
the small mountains in the foreground , they move more .
how do we create public space ?
the most horrifying and agonizing part of the whole experience was we were making decisions after decisions after decisions that were being thrust upon us .
if you 're wondering why , i 'll tell you why in a few seconds from now .
so imagine that you are taking the tea now , we 'll wait for you to finish the tea .
we also observe another thing , and that is , you folks not only are solving fewer puzzles , you 're also putting less juice into the task .
right ? it can happen in the stock market .
we let the doctors make all the decisions , take the driver 's seat .
now what a research team did was they got their hands on what 's called an icd .
they basically stuck an attacker on the wired network and on the wireless network .
they also were able to install malware that wouldn 't kick in and wouldn 't trigger until the car was doing something like going over 20 miles an hour , or something like that .
p25 radios are used by law enforcement and all kinds of government agencies and people in combat to communicate , and there 's an encryption option on these phones .
they went and reported this to the law enforcement agencies , after anonymizing it , and the vulnerability here is simply the user interface wasn 't good enough . if you 're talking about something really secure and sensitive , it should be really clear to you that this conversation is encrypted .
so what 's the point ? you can leave your iphone next to someone 's keyboard , and just leave the room , and then later recover what they did , even without using the microphone .
but i know she will anyway , so instead i 'll always keep an extra supply of chocolate and rain boots nearby , because there is no heartbreak that chocolate can 't fix .
thank you .
spoken word poetry is the art of performance poetry .
now i can divide my spoken word journey into three steps .
and the first list that i assign is " 10 things i know to be true . "
now i know that the number one rule to being cool is to seem unfazed , to never admit that anything scares you or impresses you or excites you .
you have to grow and explore and take risks and challenge yourself .
she says i have old eyes .
but in that instant , i get to share your present .
80 to 90 percent of their time was spent on five things .
and so next time your neighbor sees you they 'll say , " how is that tadpole doing ? "
what 's the -- how did you know that ? they did .
that doesn 't do a lot of good .
you can 't actually build much on a roof , they 're not designed for that .
in fact , urban migration now describes the movement of animals formerly known as wild into urban centers .
do you know what slows it down ?
and what i like to think of is this is an interface that re-scripts how we interact with natural systems , specifically by changing who has information , where they have it , who can make sense of that information , and what you can do about it .
i wanted to dissect it and look into its unseen layers .
i wanted a simple way to represent a living body inhabiting these decaying , derelict spaces .
walking in this tunnel is very peaceful .
most of my photos are set in places that have been abandoned for decades , but this is an exception .
this was taken under the montparnasse cemetery where most of the ossuaries are located .
it was performed last september one time only in the atlantic avenue tunnel in brooklyn , which is considered to be the oldest underground train tunnel in the world , built in 1844 .
we 're doing it because we want to start a revolution .
and it 's been the same in every single room , in every town that we 've ever told our story .
well , we 're in partnership with a high school .
and we 're just volunteers and it 's only an experiment .
secondly , please create -- please , please create edible landscapes so that our children start to walk past their food day in , day out , on our high streets , in our parks , wherever that might be .
that one on the right is about five feet high .
what i do is i write books about the cultural history of physics .
why on earth are you crocheting a reef ?
and they have different properties .
so it 's like the equator or the lines of longitude .
it 's a bit like this : imagine that we 'd only ever encountered euclidean space .
i once asked the mathematicians why it was that mathematicians thought this structure was impossible when sea slugs have been doing it since the silurian age .
we live in a society that completely tends to valorize symbolic forms of representation -- algebraic representations , equations , codes .
let 's fast-forward to the san francisco bay area many decades later , where i started a technology company that brought the world its first 3d laser scanning system .
as you see here , we had to develop a special rig to bring the scanner up close and personal .
imagine us as a human race not knowing where we came from .
thank you .
how dare we be optimistic ?
i thought i would start with the logo . what 's missing here , of course , is the north polar ice cap .
now , the skeptics say , " oh , wait a minute , this could be variations in this energy coming in from the sun . " if that were true , the stratosphere would be heated as well as the lower atmosphere , if it 's more coming in .
we have the technologies .
this is lake lanier . my friend heidi cullen said that if we gave droughts names the way we give hurricanes names , we 'd call the one in the southeast now katrina , and we would say it 's headed toward atlanta .
for so many people at ted , there is deep pain that basically a design issue on a voting form -- one bad design issue meant that your voice wasn 't being heard like that in the last eight years in a position where you could make these things come true .
we need help . we need help .
sometimes we spread out .
so when we think of nonverbals , we think of how we judge others , how they judge us and what the outcomes are .
so again , both animals and humans do the same thing .
like , can you do this just for a little while and actually experience a behavioral outcome that makes you seem more powerful ?
probably not , right ? you want the person who 's powerful and assertive and dominant , but not very stress reactive , the person who 's laid back .
when you 're in the low-power pose condition , only 60 percent , and that 's a pretty whopping significant difference .
so that 's what we want to test . okay ?
so i said , fake it till you make it . i don 't -- it 's not me .
you 're going to stay , and this is what you 're going to do .
tiny tweaks can lead to big changes .
but in any case , what i 'm going to do in my little bit of time is take you on a quick tour of some of the things that we talk about and we think about .
where something is , is defined with respect to this last sphere , the celestial sphere , outside of which is this eternal , perfect realm , where lives god , who is the ultimate judge of everything .
space is just one aspect , so there 's no meaning to say absolutely where something is .
now , darwin taught us that there are processes of self-organization that suffice to explain all of us and everything we see .
and you understand some things better than other things , and because of that there 's a continual jostling and give and take , which is politics .
so what this really suggested to us at the national level was that diagnostic and therapeutic strategies , which had been developed in men , by men , for men for the last 50 years -- and they work pretty well in men , don 't they ? -- weren 't working so well for women .
it 's not happening , and it 's time .
it funds research all over the place .
horrible chest pain .
and so the yellow is the fatty plaque , and panel a is a man .
and if you look carefully , you can see that there 's a black blush right there .
because women bring new life into the world .
and i 've told you , we 've been working on male-pattern heart disease for 50 years .
so thank you for your attention .
i would later find out that was houdini 's personal record .
this is a little hard to watch .
that 's holding your breath as long as you can in one place without moving .
you feel like you 're walking around in a daze .
i wanted to try it in the most extreme situations to see if i could slow my heart rate down under duress .
in january of ' 08 oprah gave me four months to prepare and train .
i wanted to get them to do a piece on it .
so , normally i would start at 38 beats per minute , and while holding my breath it would drop to 12 beats per minute , which is pretty unusual .
i started feeling pains all over my chest .
i also didn 't want anybody to question it .
to what extent are these people right ?
islam is the majority religion all the way from the atlantic ocean across the middle east , southern europe and through asia all the way to indonesia .
now let 's see what has happened in the world .
most of them are in sub-saharan africa .
you need to get out of the deepest poverty so children are not of importance for work in the family .
and that 's where family planning , better child survival is needed .
we are here on top .
thank you very much .
mars is half the size of the earth , but because two-thirds of the earth is covered by water , the land area on mars is comparable to the land area on earth .
today mars is very very dry .
sub-surface water on mars , frozen in the form of ice .
here is viking i , viking ii .
this airplane was designed at the langley research center .
we fold it , and we transport it in a spacecraft .
now , 100,000 feet , if you fly cross-country to los angeles , you fly 37,000 feet .
thank you very much .
north pole . i 've done this picture last summer .
palm tree plantation in borneo .
fifth the first thing i remember ...
13th after seven years now of being in a wheelchair , i 've done more in life being in a chair than out of a chair .
these plants , several hundred million years old .
but the wealth gaps are growing wider .
they were sent down to find if there was any opportunity for selling shoes , and they wrote telegrams back to manchester .
what actually happened was the impulses were reduced .
i went back and i transformed my entire company into a one-buttock company . "
these are the people who think they 're tone-deaf .
do you know what i think probably happened in this room ?
now , chopin didn 't want to reach the e there , because what will have happened ? it will be over , like hamlet .
it 's the same gesture he makes when he comes home after a long day , turns off the key in his car and says , " aah , i 'm home . " because we all know where home is .
and i did exactly what i did with you , and i told them and explained them and the whole thing .
how would you talk ? how would you be ?
now , we 're all about to end this magical , on-the-mountain week , and we 're going back into the world .
where is the small hadron collider ?
most of the population growth of the next 50 years will be in cities .
millions of people living here , stretched over many kilometers .
the remarkable thing about these girls , and the sign of the kind of social revolution sweeping through the developing world is that these girls are not married .
most of the children there have parents who are illiterate .
and you also need to make it intrinsically interesting .
it has 30,000 children on those building sites .
when they got to a certain stage , pratham got big enough to attract some pro bono support from mckinsey .
they fail to reach the people they most need to serve .
and they all have the same kind of features : highly collaborative , very personalized , often pervasive technology , learning that starts from questions and problems and projects , not from knowledge and curriculum .
and we are bequeathing to the developing world school systems that they will now spend a century trying to reform .
these festivals are radically open .
an artist , i think , can really show us people that we might overlook in our lives .
came to see me and said , " 1,600 of the kids that we 've sent out have come back missing at least one full arm .
i still think you 're nuts . but not as nuts as i thought . "
going to scratch his nose .
so one important environmental challenge that every system has to deal with is operating costs , just what it takes to run the system .
this is a map of the study site where i have been tracking this population of harvester ant colonies for 28 years , which is about as long as a colony lives .
but the ants are so abundant and diverse in the tropics that there 's a lot of competition .
it 's very simple .
dad talked a lot about bad design when we were growing up , you know , " bad design is just people not thinking , john , " he would say whenever a kid would be injured by a rotary lawn mower or , say , a typewriter ribbon would get tangled or an eggbeater would get jammed in the kitchen .
" doing that , acting by design , is what we all should be doing .
the poor kid , you know , has this terrified look on his face , god knows what they think .
no , no , no , no , no .
it 's a completely different domain .
but anyway , so when my wife and i decided to upgrade our early middle age -- we had four kids , after all -- with a little different technology that i won 't explain in too much detail here -- my urologist assured me i had nothing whatsoever to worry about .
we 're really hoping he thanks us for that later on .
gods we 're still fighting about . oh yeah .
i was part of this sort of background noise of the misery of zaire , completely invisible .
this is what we must demand of our lives , of our objects , of our things , of our circumstances : living with intent .
there 's the former soviet megalomaniacs .
but does it just happen over there ?
he did business with global banks .
and is this progress ? maybe , but we 're going to be keeping a very close eye on that case .
well , because there 's a lot at stake .
in the oil and mining sector , for example , there is now the beginning of a truly worldwide transparency standard that could tackle some of these problems .
it was breathtaking .
and we can then do the kinds of things that ecologists do on land , and do nearest neighbor distances .
now , this one is blue , and that 's the color of most bioluminescence in the ocean because evolution has selected for the color that travels farthest through seawater in order to optimize communication .
so , now we believe that the different shape of the lure is how the male recognizes the female in the anglerfish world , because many of these males are what are known as dwarf males .
but to me , what 's shocking is not just the amount of light , but the fact that it 's not just luciferin and luciferase .
and so , sometime ago , i got this idea for a camera system .
and i know this footage isn 't going to look like anything to you -- we had a crummy camera at the time -- but i was ecstatic .
and i thought to myself , this cpu really has to work like crazy just to keep all this data moving through the system .
so that 's true love , right there .
the net is doing the work in the brain .
and these are individual potassium ions that are flowing through that pore .
and the only kind of thing -- the only thing we know right now that can compute with these kinds of devices are the brain .
instead of doing this in software , or doing those kinds of algorithms , we went and talked to neurobiologists who have actually reverse engineered that piece of brain that 's called the retina .
and this is the same thing you see when people compress video to send : they want to make it very sparse , because that file is smaller . and this is what the retina is doing , and it 's doing it just with the circuitry , and how this network of neurons that are interacting in there , which we 've captured on the chip .
i was coming at it from a different perspective , where i was bringing that different perspective to bear on the problem .
this is a rancher in texas , by william albert allard , a great portraitist .
and this is what a photograph taps into when it makes its own powerful connection to a viewer .
he 's actually taking his own picture , shot with what 's called a camera trap .
and they only came for the ivory .
we teamed up underwater photographer brian skerry and photojournalist randy olson to document the depletion of the world 's fisheries .
from here , the more severely wounded are transported back to germany , where they meet up with their families for the first time .
and paul said he was never really afraid , because she was more curious about him than threatened .
they are very important to how we communicate with each other .
and , even more importantly , since this is a photometric process that only takes three seconds to capture , we can shoot emily in just part of an afternoon , in many different facial poses and facial expressions .
so , by analyzing this video with computer vision techniques , they were able to drive the facial rig with the computer-generated performance .
if you think about it , the english language has written into it negative associations towards the clouds .
or seeing the big , white , puffy one up there over the shopping center looks like the abominable snowman going to rob a bank .
let 's start with this one . it 's the cirrus cloud , named after the latin for a lock of hair .
and these clouds , these rarer clouds , remind us that the exotic can be found in the everyday .
you 're not going to change the world by lying on your back and gazing up at the sky , are you ?
i feel like that was always sort of my destiny , although i had for many years been pretty deeply in the trivia closet .
i never had a guidance counselor who thought this was a legitimate career path , that thought you could major in trivia or be a professional ex-game show contestant .
the kind of thing that a three- or four-year-old human , little kid could do , very hard for a computer .
watson does not travel .
i felt obsolete .
i have read that there 's now actually evidence that the hippocampus , the part of our brain that handles spacial relationships , physically shrinks and atrophies in people who use tools like gps , because we 're not exercising our sense of direction anymore .
a decision like where do i go to school ? what should i major in ?
but not on that beach , not on mai khao beach , because this little girl had remembered one fact from her geography teacher a month before .
i don 't want to be the last trivia know-it-all sitting on a mountain somewhere , reciting to himself the state capitals and the names of " simpsons " episodes and the lyrics of abba songs .
we can live in one of these two worlds .
they are pictured here for their 25th anniversary newsweek retrospective on the internet .
well , to move data around from one place to another -- again , it 's not like a package courier .
this is a common occurrence . governments everywhere are often trying to block and filter and censor content on the internet .
something is up in pakistan . "
but now , wikipedia doesn 't just spontaneously work .
they 're realizing that they have to take responsibility for what they do .
i know they look silly . and sure they look silly .
in the real world , we see filtering of this sort taking place in pakistan .
it 's a bee that , yes , flies .
and these doctors or these masters , these spiritual masters of the sufi tradition , refer to teachings and examples of our prophet that teach us where the source of our problems lies .
" and , " god says , " my servant continues to get nearer to me , by doing more of what i 've asked them to do " -- extra credit , we might call it -- " until i love him or love her .
we travel beyond the limitations of space as we know it , and beyond the limitations of time as we know it .
for he foretold of a period when people shall transform their swords into plowshares and will not learn war or make war anymore .
my daughter 's 20 . she 's a college student .
we 're getting used to a new way of being alone together .
so that 's the bottom line .
that 's why it 's so appealing to have a facebook page or a twitter feed -- so many automatic listeners .
and i ask myself , " why have things come to this ? "
we use technology to define ourselves by sharing our thoughts and feelings even as we 're having them .
and we 're afraid , like young lovers , that too much talking might spoil the romance .
and we have the greatest chance of success if we recognize our vulnerability .
writing is something that came along much later , and as we saw in the last talk , there 's a little bit of controversy as to exactly when that happened , but according to traditional estimates , if humanity had existed for 24 hours , then writing only came along at about 11 : 07 p.m.
the gettysburg address was not the main meal of that event .
but the fact of the matter is that what is going on is a kind of emergent complexity .
lol is being used in a very particular way .
you don 't just zip right into it .
and so , there are always — — there are always people worrying about these things and the planet somehow seems to keep spinning .
in other words , i look for aliens , and when i tell people that at a cocktail party , they usually look at me with a mildly incredulous look on their face .
in fact , we don 't know about any life beyond earth , but i 'm going to suggest to you that that 's going to change rather soon , and part of the reason , in fact , the majority of the reason why i think that 's going to change is that the equipment 's getting better .
well , a million star systems , is that interesting ?
now , i might be at ground zero for this .
it would change his day , all right ?
well , here 's one example , in fact .
okay ? so that doesn 't get people interested in science because they can 't comprehend what it 's about .
and he gave some talk . all i remember from it was one word : electronics .
so to me , it is a privilege , and when i look in the mirror , the facts are that i really don 't see myself .
many rooms are not so good .
they had to go back in and spend 600,000 pounds putting the walls in . let 's stop this madness of open plan classrooms right now , please .
it 's not just the children who are affected , though .
where are the urban sound planners ?
it 's my beautiful baby .
so we got started .
we thought we had all our bases covered , we 'd done everything right .
so this is another one of these mind-boggling global problems .
so here 's a neonatal intensive care unit where moms come in to visit their babies .
it sounds crazy , it sounds dumb , but there are actually hospitals who would rather have no equipment than something that looks cheap and crummy .
so if mom does put a blanket over the baby , it 's still receiving effective phototherapy from below .
i got into this business designing products .
you can download the gene sequences of pathogens off the internet if you want to , and clearly someone recently -- i saw in a science magazine -- they said , well , the 1918 flu is too dangerous to fedex around .
and i walked down the middle , up to the train station , and everything below 14th street was closed .
i think the challenge for us is -- i 'm very certain that that will happen , the challenge is , will we develop the kind of educational tools and things with the net to let us take advantage of that device ?
their strength : they 're almost the strongest material , tensile strength material known .
new ways of making electric transportation .
cocktails , more polyvalent vaccines .
today scientists , technologists , businessmen , engineers don 't have any personal responsibility for the consequences of their actions .
our special is tracking cookie .
so i decided to take these cool creatures and make a superhero team .
soon , my items began selling all over the world , and i had customers in denmark , italy , australia , canada and more .
pat mitchell : so , you heard maya talk about the amazing parents who are behind this incredible woman . where are they ?
and two weeks later , sunday morning , 9th of january , i found myself standing in front of my congregation -- intelligent , well meaning , mostly thoughtful christian people -- and i needed to express , on their behalf , our feelings and our questions .
now the unchanging god feels a bit cold and indifferent to me .
does god order each moment ? does the wind and the waves obey him ?
perhaps god allows or permits terrible things to happen , so that heroism and compassion can be shown .
the people knew their god by his mighty acts .
i don 't know .
no neat packages of faith , with bible references to prove them .
to combine engineering and design and ...
the condition is known as retrolental fibroplasia , and it 's now very rare in the developed world .
i gave them a tape recorder , and they read into it .
sadly , he died in a light plane crash in 2005 , but his memory lives on in my heart .
he then turned to being a waterskier and was a champion disabled waterskier .
now there are still barriers in front of we people with disabilities .
the technology will advance even further , but i can still remember my mum saying , 60 years ago , " remember , darling , you 'll never be able to read the print with your fingers . "
it was the world 's first popular computer .
there is the position of the sun , moon and planets on the movable rete .
so let 's go to step one .
he would know where things would fit in the sky .
astrolabes , like every technology , do evolve over time .
thanks very much .
so , as all of you probably know , the classic way of thinking about this is the diffusion-of-innovation , or the adoption curve .
so if you look at this , you might immediately grasp that different people have different numbers of connections .
and what we show here is -- like , here -- very few people are affected , more and more and more and up to here , and here 's the peak of the epidemic .
and we did this passively by looking at whether or not they 'd gone to university health services .
and the size of the dots is going to be proportional to how many of their friends have the flu .
so 96 percent is as good as 100 percent .
so the truckers are just going about their business , and they 're buying fuel .
so yesterday , i was out in the street in front of this building , and i was walking down the sidewalk , and i had company , several of us , and we were all abiding by the rules of walking down sidewalks .
now working memory capacity has a fairly long history , and it 's associated with a lot of positive effects .
all right , now what i want you to do is to recite the last five letters of the english alphabet backwards .
gotta make sure we 're getting what we 're looking for .
now the first part of this that we need to think about and we need to process our existence , our life , immediately and repeatedly .
if you read a book , pull things up .
now i have to take off my shoes or boots to get on an airplane !
i fell asleep on the plane , until during the middle of the night , we landed on the azores islands for refueling .
but i wanted to elaborate on a couple of these .
a lot of us in here have made that decision and it is really pretty easy .
support the idea of capping carbon dioxide emissions , global warming pollution , and trading it . here 's why : as long as the united states is out of the world system , it 's not a closed system .
the second guy -- we 'll call him bill -- is transfixed by embarrassment , at staring at the thing there in the center .
i 'm going to ask you to raise your hand , whether you are liberal , left of center -- on social issues , we 're talking about , primarily -- or conservative , and i 'll give a third option , because i know there are a number of libertarians in the audience .
so anyway , let 's go with the red pill .
there 's actually ambiguous evidence as to whether you find reciprocity in other animals , but the evidence for people could not be clearer .
i think this is what we come with , at least a preparedness to learn all of these things .
conservatives have more of a five-foundation , or five-channel morality .
what makes them moral ?
but then -- and here 's the trick -- fehr and gachter said , on the seventh round , they told people , " you know what ? new rule .
it took all of our moral psychology to create these cooperative groups .
so once you see this -- once you see that liberals and conservatives both have something to contribute , that they form a balance on change versus stability -- then i think the way is open to step outside the moral matrix .
well , if you take the greatest insights from ancient asian philosophies and religions , and you combine them with the latest research on moral psychology , i think you come to these conclusions : that our righteous minds were designed by evolution to unite us into teams , to divide us against other teams and then to blind us to the truth .
why is it that we study other animals instead of them studying us ?
so the main reason for saying that our brain is larger than it should be actually comes from comparing ourselves to great apes .
this soup contains all the nuclei that once were a mouse brain .
and all of you are primates .
so it 's either a large body or a large number of neurons .
my answer is that we have the largest number of neurons in the cerebral cortex , and i think that 's the simplest explanation for our remarkable cognitive abilities .
life is temptation . it 's all about yielding , resisting , yes , no , now , later , impulsive , reflective , present focus and future focus .
they vary between cultures , between nations , between individuals , between social classes , between education levels .
you can be future-oriented , setting goals .
i 've added present-hedonism , i 've added a focus on the past-positive , so , at 76 years old , i am more energetic than ever , more productive , and i 'm happier than i have ever been .
my freelance job ended . and i had to get a full-time job to pay the bills .
i hadn 't changed . my i.q. hadn 't dropped .
and i stood there . and i reread my essay .
hope always , always finds a way . thank you .
and i spent quite a lot of time with them rather than in punts .
and i think you can see around us now , some of the green shoots of a very different kind of economy and capitalism which could grow .
you can see a bit of the same thing happening in the business world .
he believed if you see a problem , you shouldn 't tell someone to act , you should act on it yourself , and he lived long enough and saw enough of his ideas first scorned and then succeed that he said you should always take no as a question and not as an answer .
now those are all goals which could be achieved within a decade , but only with radical and systematic experiment , not just with technologies , but also with lifestyles and culture and policies and institutions too .
and as that happens , we will remember something very simple and obvious about capitalism , which is that , unlike what you read in economics textbooks , it 's not a self-sufficient system .
and i left everything and went for a long series of odd jobs .
i love oddities of languages .
so i want to see how things work and what 's happening .
people tell me their lives , their memories , their aspirations , and i create a mindscape .
larger images , i started to run marathons .
here it 's an artist book installation called " identity project . "
i called it " working in the same direction . "
and on the branches you have library material growing .
it is a papercutting , and then after , i added color on the computer .
audience : it 's people logging on to google around the world .
but basically , what we 've noticed is these queries , which come in at thousands per second , are available everywhere there is power .
in the u.s. and spain , it was popular at the same time .
this is orkut . is anybody here on orkut ?
there are a variety of demographics . i won 't bore you with these .
and this is how we keep our innovation running .
and the idea is , instead of a toolbar , it 's just present all the time on your screen on the bottom , and you can do searches really easily .
and i think we 've done a good job encouraging that .
and the idea behind this is to do the perfect job doing search , you really have to be smart .
and then we produced " you suck . "
it 's either poverty , low attendance , negative peer influences . we know why .
i 'm not real good with math , but i was working on it .
i deserve the education that i get here .
you made it work for me .
so , before i became a dermatologist , i started in general medicine , as most dermatologists do in britain .
but this graph is after taking into account all of these known risk factors .
but i also became interested in research , and in particular i became interested in this substance , nitric oxide .
and in edinburgh , the experimental animal we use is the medical student .
now , we 're still collecting data .
so we thought we 'd just kind of model -- different amounts of uv hit different parts of the earth at different times of year , so you can actually work out those stores of nitric oxide -- the nitrates , nitrites , nitrosothiols in the skin -- cleave to release no .
we think they 're then stored in the skin , and we think the sunlight releases this where it has generally beneficial effects .
the second thing that happened is that i spent the day in the camden , new jersey police department .
now , moneyball , as many of you know , is what the oakland a 's did , where they used smart data and statistics to figure out how to pick players that would help them win games , and they went from a system that was based on baseball scouts who used to go out and watch players and use their instinct and experience , the scouts ' instincts and experience , to pick players , from one to use smart data and rigorous statistical analysis to figure out how to pick players that would help them win games .
almost seven in 10 people who are released from prison will be rearrested in a constant cycle of crime and incarceration .
they 're like the baseball scouts 20 years ago who were using their instinct and their experience to try to decide what risk someone poses .
what judges see if they run the risk assessment tool is this -- it 's a dashboard .
i found this observation test about the story of the ark .
but it 's something completely wrong .
this is a very fast movement .
it 's a kind of vegetarian experimentation .
he wrote some very interesting letters to one of his friends who was j.d. hooker , or at that time , president of the royal society , so the maximum scientific authority in britain speaking about the brain in the plants .
so , a suggestion for the people working with networks : plants are able to give you good suggestions about how to evolve networks .
interpreter : by making myself invisible , i try to explore and question the contradictory and often inter-canceling relationship between our civilization and its development .
i found that any culture has its irreconcilable contradictions .
this one is called instant noodles .
we are going to talk today about the sequel of " inconvenient truth . "
how to take care in five easy steps : first of all , you can use natural ventilation . you can use body breath .
and this is what the young generation says .
but i 'm going to end by widening the lens to the entire region to look at the mundane topics of arab views of religion and politics and how this impacts women , revealing some surprises along the way .
eighty-eight percent said moving toward greater democracy would help muslims progress -- the highest percentage of any country we surveyed .
and what really struck me is that less than 24 months ago , it was the people that were nervous about being watched by their government .
a full third of those who braved tanks and tear gas to ask or to demand liberty and justice in egypt were women .
we need to rediscover the lost art of democratic argument .
or by the first person to rush into the hall to get them .
he says that to reason about just distribution of a thing , we have to reason about , and sometimes argue about , the purpose of the thing , or the social activity -- in this case , musical performance .
suppose you were deciding the justice of this case .
but what about walking from hole to hole ?
is walking the course essential to the game ?
" to say that something is essential is ordinarily to say that it is necessary to the achievement of a certain object .
there are those who favor state recognition only of traditional marriage between one man and one woman , and there are those who favor state recognition of same-sex marriage .
thanks , chris .
there 's the tri-fold . people typically take two or three .
dry .
and remember , one towel per person for one year -- 571,230,000 pounds of paper . no small thing .
in the 1970s , when it appeared that the price of energy would never retreat , our economy was soaring , and then in the early 1980s , it cratered quickly .
best city to get a job , best city to start a business , best downtown -- oklahoma city .
along the way , though , i started examining my city , its culture , its infrastructure , trying to figure out why our specific city seemed to have a problem with obesity .
and so they started helping us drive traffic to the website .
we had built libraries and we had built neighborhoods , but we had never really connected the two with any sort of walkability .
and if you 're like me , at some point in your educational career , you were asked to read a book called " the grapes of wrath . "
and that 's kind of what has been the spirit of what we are doing .
so that kind of tells you about , kind of , the fun things , you know , and the serious things that we try to do .
you look outside : you have all that beauty that you see , all that life that you see around you , and here we have intelligent people like you and i who are having a conversation here .
it has volcanoes on it . and that 's mount olympus on mars , which is a kind of huge volcanic shield on that planet .
now , it 's kind of a little bit of a challenge driving down a slope like this .
yeah !
it 's the first mission that 's going to try to land near the north pole of mars , and it 's the first mission that 's actually going to try and reach out and touch water on the surface of another planet .
we no longer need the heat shield to protect us from the force of atmospheric entry , so we jettison the heat shield , exposing for the first time our lander to the atmosphere of mars .
so it will be a very tense moment , you know , as we are watching that spacecraft landing on another planet .
to give you an idea of the size , you know , of that parachute relative to the people standing there .
so it 's a little bit like " star wars , " you know , but it 's real .
what you are seeing here is the shadow of the ring on saturn itself .
so if you were on titan , you would feel the same pressure that you feel in here . except it 's a lot colder , and that atmosphere is heavily made of methane .
there is a -- i 'm not sure you can see it very well , but on the top left , around 10 o 'clock , there is a little teeny dot , and that 's earth .
indeed , mental illnesses are also very damaging to people 's lives , but beyond just the burden of disease , let us consider the absolute numbers .
the actual number is about 3,000 , about two percent of that number .
for me , what 's truly sundar about the idea of task shifting , though , isn 't that it simply makes health care more accessible and affordable but that it is also fundamentally empowering .
and what was amazing to me -- well it was pretty kickass ; he was killing a fly in the house with a gun -- but what was so amazing to me was that he knew just enough how to pump it .
it would have " heart " in that it would have passion and heart and soul .
this isn 't photoshopped .
the sun rises , and it melts away .
and he spends that week talking to the family about what do they think great art is .
so hopefully what happens is you never use it , and it 's an heirloom that you pass down .
you know , we look down a dark alley or a jungle path , trying to make out a face or a creature .
this is a typical angora embroidery for them .
and that 's my cousin and my sister 's dog , gabby .
thanks .
there was this big sort of bumpy-looking virus on the cover , and i just wanted to read it . i picked up that book , and as we drove from the edge of the grand canyon to big sur , and to , actually , here where we are today , in monterey , i read that book , and from when i was reading that book , i knew that i wanted to have a life in medicine .
and this is really what i want to talk to you about today -- about cancer .
we 're removing the cancer cells , but we 're revealing the previous damage that the body has tried to fix .
and furthermore , that nervous tissue -- brain -- gets cancer , and brain cells are also terminally differentiated .
so a tumor expresses chemokine receptors , and another organ -- a distant organ somewhere in the body -- will have the corresponding chemokines , and the tumor will see these chemokines and migrate towards it .
these cells are so versatile , these cancer cells are so versatile -- we just have to manipulate them in the right way .
tending those 31 dying people were young women from villages around bangalore .
so we can ask : what is compassion comprised of ?
and in that paralysis , of course , our capacity for compassion is also paralyzed .
in buddhism , we say , " it takes a strong back and a soft front . "
he sees that the dog has this big wound on its leg .
and before i tell you about that , i just have to tell you this one little picture of graffiti there i picked off the web the other day .
and i said , no , you really ought to study brains . they said , oh , you know , you 're wrong . and i said , no , you 're wrong , and i didn 't get in .
sometimes a science will tell something about ourselves , it 'll tell us who we are .
if you ask neuroscientists , why is this the state of affair , they 'll first of all admit it . but if you ask them , they 'll say , well , there 's various reasons we don 't have a good brain theory .
it 's just a bunch of cells . you understand your liver .
finally , another thing is the answer was there all along , but we kind of ignored it because of this obvious thing , and that 's the thing .
and alan turing defined the turing test , which is essentially saying , we 'll know if something 's intelligent if it behaves identical to a human .
now , in evolution , what happened ?
and if you 're a rat and you go through a maze , and then you learn the maze , the next time you 're in a maze , you have the same behavior , but all of a sudden , you 're smarter because you say , oh , i recognize this maze , i know which way to go , i 've been here before , i can envision the future . and that 's what it 's doing .
what your brain is doing is making constant predictions all the time about what is going to happen in your environment .
how do you store and recall these sequences or patterns ? it 's spatio-temporal patterns .
and as i said , the theory must be biologically accurate , it must be testable , and you must be able to build it .
i don 't know how this is going to turn out .
so why was it that , just a few nights later , as i stood in that same e.r. and determined that my diabetic patient did indeed need an amputation , why did i hold her in such bitter contempt ?
you can think of insulin as this master hormone that controls what our body does with the foods we eat , whether we burn it or store it .
what if obesity is a coping mechanism for a far more sinister problem going on underneath the cell ?
we know that 30 million obese americans in the united states don 't have insulin resistance .
i 've decided that what i can 't and won 't do anymore is pretend i have the answers when i don 't .
staying true to that path will be better for our patients and better for science .
now a laser is different .
so as my friend was trying to explain that experiment , it seemed like the more he said , the less i understood .
now , david builds mathematical models of this and then he tests those in the lab , but before he does that , he works with dancers to figure out what kinds of models to build in the first place .
i shall now , therefore , humbly propose my own thoughts , which i hope will not be liable to the least objection .
terrorists have actually adapted to it .
we 've talked there about curtailing the underlying need for the product itself . you could be looking there at poverty , injustice , all those sorts of things which feed terrorism .
they are somebody who can actually stand there and say , " this product 's crap . i had it and i was sick for days .
she had a daughter who was going to go to one of the best universities . she 's going to give up university to look after mum .
i want to go back just to before the bang , to this idea of brand , and i was talking about coke and pepsi , etc .
some of those victims said enough is enough .
the advantages of dialogue are obvious .
what is definitely uncontroversial is that , as i 've said , we 've got to stop being reactive , and more proactive , and i just want to leave you with one idea , which is that it 's a provocative question for you to think about , and the answer will require sympathy with the devil .
it seemed kind of odd to do , and actually , that first meeting , i remember thinking , " i have to be the one to ask the next question , " because i knew i was going to huff and puff during this conversation .
after all , what constitutes a world leader ?
and of course they have more influence , sometimes , about how they 're seen .
if you then wanted to connect to another city , let 's say from calcutta you wanted to call delhi , you 'd have to book something called a trunk call , and then sit by the phone all day , waiting for it to come through .
so this empowerment of the underclass is the real result of india being connected .
they had to suspend functions at 8 : 30 .
it 's a civilizational story to begin with .
but people see a society for what it is , and that , it seems to me , is what ultimately will make a difference in today 's information era , in today 's ted age .
but , it 's all taking place in an open society , in a rich and diverse and plural civilization , in one that is determined to liberate and fulfill the creative energies of its people .
this little robot was somehow able to tap into something deeply social within us -- and with that , the promise of an entirely new way we could interact with robots .
well , one of the things that we 've learned is that , if we design these robots to communicate with us using the same body language , the same sort of non-verbal cues that people use -- like nexi , our humanoid robot , is doing here -- what we find is that people respond to robots a lot like they respond to people .
the remote collaborator was an experimenter from our group who used one of three different technologies to interact with the participants .
i imagine a time not too far from now -- my mom can go to her computer , open up a browser and jack into a little robot .
it could help you set goals and track your progress , and it would help motivate you .
we know that kids spend a lot of time behind screens today , whether it 's television or computer games or whatnot .
i actually want them to create those experiences .
when we think about why we hear , we don 't often think about the ability to hear an alarm or a siren , although clearly that 's an important thing .
mother : that 's an owl .
this is her 10 years later .
cl : and so she 's phenomenal .
now the problems begin first with pitch perception .
these have similar wave forms . they 're both sustained instruments .
now why would we know what beethoven 's skull looks like ?
not long after , i was fitted with hearing aids .
and let me tell you right now , it 's fine that we would all be very happy with speech .
that 's a wonderful thing .
so if you think about that , eight percent of our contribution to greenhouse gases today comes from those two materials alone .
the way i describe this best , i 've found , is to say that we 're all used to two-by-four construction when we think about wood .
the last thing we want to do is cut down trees .
the reason we picked it is because this is a technical university , and i believe that wood is the most technologically advanced material i can build with .
and there 's things that no one 's voice can do .
there 's things like pitch-shifting , which are awesome , and i 'm going to show you now what that sounds like .
but in actual fact , i haven 't made this machine so that i can emulate things that already exist .
and when i talk about darwinian evolution , i mean one thing and one thing only , and that is survival of the fittest .
but when i saw this , i was really fascinated , because it seemed lifelike .
well what about matter ?
and so we have to understand that if we 're going to make artificial life or understand the origin of life , we need to power it somehow .
this seems most likely .
because if i want evolution , i need containers to compete .
they want their shape to persist .
wouldn 't it be great if you could take these artificial biological cells and fuse them with biological ones to correct problems that we couldn 't really deal with ?
you believe you 're going to be successful in this project ?
he lived into his 80s , and he was buried beneath this monument in 720 ad .
it was told by an anonymous kwakiutl indian of southern alaska to a missionary in 1896 , and here it is .
we found activity in a tiny , little factory near the base of the brain called the ventral tegmental area .
you know , when you 've been dumped , the one thing you love to do is just forget about this human being , and then go on with your life -- but no , you just love them harder .
romantic love enables you to focus your mating energy on just one at a time , conserve your mating energy , and start the mating process with this single individual .
there are over eight words for what they call " animal favoritism : " selective proceptivity , mate choice , female choice , sexual choice .
and we tend to fall in love with somebody from the same socioeconomic background , the same general level of intelligence , the same general level of good looks , the same religious values .
we swivel towards each other , we do what we call the " anchoring gaze " and we talk .
but a declining population is going to have at least two very beneficial economic effects .
if we have a positive view about the future then we may be able to accelerate through that turn , instead of careening off a cliff .
and we thought , well , that 's not really good enough .
well , there are a lot of things people have tried for many years for solving malaria .
and if you look through the eye , or you look at the vessels on the white of the eye , in fact , you may be able to do this directly , without drawing any blood at all , or through your nail beds .
or you could spray .
and , in a moment , we 're going to see a view of the airflow .
well , we could protect very high-value targets like clinics .
so , eric johanson , who built the device , actually , with parts from ebay ; and pablos holman over here , he 's got mosquitoes in the tank .
this is one of the first ones we did .
the electric company in this nation operates under a rule , which says that it has to sell electricity at a very low , subsidized price -- in fact , a price that is so low it loses money on every unit that it sells .
if you zoom in here , you can see north korea , in outline here , which is like a black hole compared to its neighbors .
this next chart looks at more recent data .
two : operate on the right scale .
people can come live under the new charter , but no one is forced to live under it .
build -- run a special administrative zone .
turn it into a square that stands for all the arable land on earth .
you could use the gains on the value of the land to pay for things like the police , the courts , but the school system and the health care system too , which make this a more attractive place to live , makes this a place where people have higher incomes -- which , incidentally , makes the land more valuable .
now we are experiencing another metamorphic change : the industrial internet .
so let me give you a few examples of how these brilliant machines work , and some of the examples may seem trivial , some are clearly more profound , but all of them are going to have a very powerful impact .
so all of this translates into better health outcomes , but it can also deliver substantial economic benefits .
it creates new demand , new jobs .
but this is not a foregone conclusion .
you don 't want to sell too early , because you miss out on profits , but you don 't want to wait too late to when everyone else sells , triggering a crash .
this is a beautiful data set of 9,000 people who wrote in to three newspapers and magazines that had a contest .
and these are all areas which are fairly reliably known to be part of what 's called a " theory of mind " circuit , or " mentalizing circuit . "
the twist is that one player , on the left , is informed about how much on each trial there is .
this turns out to be something that 's predicted by a very complicated type of game theory you should come to graduate school at caltech and learn about .
they 're hairy , smelly , fast and strong .
right ? who thinks you could beat the chimps ?
and as you can see , the chimps , each chimp is one triangle , are circled around , hovering around that prediction .
so a friend of mine who 's a political scientist , he told me several months ago exactly what this month would be like .
here 's another way to look at exactly the same problem .
wealth is ripped away from people who shouldn 't be called unproductive .
raise medical health care contributions ?
around a quarter say that they are republicans .
those groups are very , very small .
each of those times , we were on the verge of complete collapse .
it 's like if you 're a chef and you put it on your menu , you risk being attacked .
what 's natural about foie gras ?
a huge scandal for a few weeks .
he kept going like this to me .
he electrifies only the outside .
he lets them take what they want and he says , " usually , it 's about 50 percent . they 're very fair . "
of the highest quality foie gras yellow i 've ever seen .
no way .
it was incredible .
but no .
and in the corner of one of these -- one of my notes , is this note that says , when asked , what do you think of conventional foie gras ?
the pharaoh got -- i swear to god .
it 's rooted in extraction .
i 've been in afghanistan for 21 years .
so the orthopedic center was closed because physical rehabilitation was not considered a priority .
the man was without legs and only with one arm .
and i spoke with a gatekeeper .
but they insisted .
i tell you , it was something so sinister that i was astonished he could do it every day .
no need of staying with me all the day pushing my wheelchair . "
that was the job .
i could not believe .
he was a new man , taller again .
and when you start changing , you cannot stop .
i said , " no , " you can imagine .
i came back in ' 86 .
and one day -- i don 't know what happened -- while coming back from the office towards home , maybe i saw a honey bee or it occurred to my mind that if i only could be like the honey bee , life would be wonderful .
i 'm a professor ; i must quiz you .
the rice that you ate in the lunch , and you will eat today , is transplanted by women bending in a very awkward posture , millions of them , every season , in the paddy season , when they transplant paddy with their feet in the water .
and this is what he got painted .
they will be paid for what they are good at , not what they 're bad at .
he is washing your clothes and drying them at your doorstep .
and now with one dollar , you can afford a better alternative than the people market is offering you .
saidullah sahib is an amazing man .
ag : many of you might not realize and believe that we have sold this product internationally -- what i call a g2g model , grassroots to global .
that is what kanak das has done .
i will just tell you that we are also doing a competition among children for creativity , a whole range of things .
it exists in many layers , ecosystems , species and genes across many scales -- international , national , local , community -- and doing for nature what lord stern and his team did for nature is not that easy .
it 's not just about the amazonas , or indeed about rainforests .
because these are important benefits for the poor .
that 's not that hard .
that has to stop .
of course , after the event one can be wise .
today what we have is basically a brown carbon marketplace .
as you can see , they cut across the entire globe all the way from micronesia across indonesia , malaysia , india , madagascar and to the west of the caribbean .
and these days , people ask me a lot , how did that feel .
and i think that 's symbolic of what we 're seeing in the world in general , that the world is becoming smaller and smaller , and that all of the peoples in the world are enjoying more opportunities for connection .
so , as we are climbing the tree , some of the things that we 're doing in order to climb the tree are actually undermining the tree 's very root .
and that moment came on april 21 , 1994 .
most of us were groomed not only on images of nuclear catastrophe , but also on images and knowledge of the holocaust .
they have launched a divestment campaign that has now convinced , i think , 55 universities in 22 states to divest their holdings of stocks with regard to companies doing business in sudan .
i think there are a couple -- there are many reasons -- but a couple just to focus on briefly .
he was the victim of the first-ever suicide bomb in iraq .
israel then invaded and overran the u.n. base .
late ' 90s : nation-building is the cause du jour .
but it was too late for sergio .
and it doesn 't have to be an act of weakness .
fourth and final point : he somehow , because he was working in all the world 's worst places and all lesser evils , had a humility , of course , and an awareness of the complexity of the world around him .
in manitoba , this is an image from the east side of lake winnipeg , and this is the home of the newly designated unesco cultural heritage site .
that 's not a bad size home .
oil sands -- or rather i should say tar sands -- " oil sands " is a p.r.-created term so that the oil companies wouldn 't be trying to promote something that sounds like a sticky tar-like substance that 's the world 's dirtiest oil .
it 's carcinogenic . "
this is the infrastructure as we see it about now .
and we can do that . there is a huge network all over the world fighting to stop this project .
but it was his production of a butterfly that was the most beautiful .
some people deceive for money .
our self-deception becomes a positive illusion -- why movies are able to take us onto extraordinary adventures ; why we believe romeo when he says he loves juliet ; and why single notes of music , when played together , become a sonata and conjure up meaning .
this here is nissan 's myleaf , where your driving behavior is compared with the driving behavior of other people , so you can compete for who drives around the most fuel efficiently .
as you see in today 's modern liberal democracies , the society , the state , not only allows us to determine our self , to shape our self , it also demands it of us .
is just one way of looking at ethics .
which is what peter-paul verbeek , the dutch philosopher of technology , says .
why , when the question of what the good life is informs everything that we design , should we stop at design and not ask ourselves , how does it apply to our own life ?
it climbs up to the top , and it falls , and it climbs , and it falls , and it climbs -- trying to stay at the very top of the blade of grass .
most people have .
this is what our summum bonum is .
and it 's just about a full-time job trying to prevent people who are scared of these ideas from caricaturing them and then running off to one dire purpose or another .
there are different species of memes .
i 'm just going to draw your attention to just one of the many implications of the memetic perspective , which i recommend .
they 're not a big deal for us .
j.j. from " good times , " significant to many people of course because of " dy-no-mite , " but perhaps more significant as the first , really , black artist on primetime tv .
harlem now , sort of explaining and thinking of itself in this part of the century , looking both backwards and forwards ...
what that might mean for cultural movements all over this moment , the " me , we " seems incredibly prescient totally important .
for me , it is about re-imagining this cultural discourse in an international context .
and that meant they were market based , or they were government owned , depending on what kind of system they were in . and this characterized and anchored the way information and knowledge were produced for the next 150 years .
so , nasa , at some point , did an experiment where they took images of mars that they were mapping , and they said , instead of having three or four fully trained ph.d.s doing this all the time , let 's break it up into small components , put it up on the web , and see if people , using a very simple interface , will actually spend five minutes here , 10 minutes there , clicking . after six months , 85,000 people used this to generate mapping at a faster rate than the images were coming in , which was , quote , " practically indistinguishable from the markings of a fully-trained ph.d. , " once you showed it to a number of people and computed the average .
so , essentially what we 're seeing is the emergence of a fourth transactional framework . it used to be that there were two primary dimensions along which you could divide things . they could be market based , or non-market based ; they could be decentralized , or centralized .
five minutes , instead of watching tv ?
so next time you open the paper , and you see an intellectual property decision , a telecoms decision , it 's not about something small and technical .
there were two sundays in between . but of course , sundays are church days , so you don 't play on sundays . and one day it rained , so they all sat around making friends with each other .
1983 was when we won the world cup .
and then something very dramatic happened .
it was a new thing for us . we had only ever supported our country -- the only two areas in which india was very proud about their country , representing itself on the field .
and so they started promoting cricket big time , started promoting clubs big time .
we have arrived somewhere . we are thinking big . "
we can play cricket together , we can be friends .
what india was doing , though , was benchmarking itself against the best in the world , and it became a huge brand .
hopefully , it 'll make everyone richer , hopefully it 'll make the game bigger and hopefully it 'll give cricket commentators more time in the business .
when we think about cognition , we analogize the brain to a computer . that 's no problem .
seymour recruited me to caltech in the late 1980s .
and what this quantification showed us is that , upon experiencing a train of these air puffs , the flies appear to enter a kind of state of hyperactivity which is persistent , long-lasting , and also appears to be graded .
you can train a fly to avoid an odor , shown here in blue , if you pair that odor with a shock .
whether the same thing is true in adhd in humans we don 't know , but these kinds of results should at least cause us to consider that possibility .
but something 's happened in the last 18 years since richard started ted , and that 's that people like us -- i know people in other places have caught onto this for a long time , but for us , we 've really just started ... we 've kind of climbed maslow 's hierarchy a little bit -- and so we 're now focused more and more on human-centered design , human-centeredness in an approach to design .
the last time i went to see this store , there was a huge buzz about people standing outside and wondering , " am i going to actually get to see the people changing clothes here ? "
scott adams ran into us and asked us if we wouldn 't help to design the ultimate cubicle for dilbert , which sounded like a fun thing and so we couldn 't pass it up .
the pavilion 's design goal was to be kind of quiet and peaceful .
( and this central box connects the whole system together .
so we saw a lot of interesting things being designed today in this session , and from all the different presenters .
my first question was , naturally , what was i going to wear ?
also , two women with passionate hearts : wangari maathai , the nobel prizewinner from kenya who has planted 30 million trees . and by doing so , she has changed the soil , the weather , in some places in africa , and of course the economic conditions in many villages .
she walked elegantly , like a giraffe on the african savannah , holding the flag on her shoulder . i jogged behind -- on my tiptoes -- holding the flag on my extended arm , so that my head was actually under the damn flag .
somehow , the family survives for 16 months , and then , by extraordinary luck , and the passionate heart of a young american man , sasha chanoff , who manages to put her in a u.s. rescue plane , rose mapendo and her nine children end up in phoenix , arizona , where they 're now living and thriving .
it has evolved . if you don 't like the term , change it , for goddess ' sake .
the husband , furious , threatens to kill the american .
in any war today , most of the casualties are civilians , mainly women and children . they are collateral damage .
we need a critical number of women in positions of power , and we need to nurture the feminine energy in men .
one of the opportunities i had was one person was working on a really interesting micromagnetic resonance imaging machine with the nih .
it 's just basically two strands .
" my air jordans cost a hundred with tax .
come out of the station , west 4th near the park , brothers shooting hoops and someone remarks , ' hey homes , where you get them nik 's ? ' i says to myself , ' yeah . i likes ' em , i likes . ' they were q-tip white , bright and blinding my eyes .
and in 1996 , i found the answer in principles in a master spoken-word artist named reg e. gaines , who wrote the famous poem , " please don 't take my air jordans . "
because people like me took your job .
and i can tell you this happens , because it happened to me .
it didn 't help .
but in the end , business grew bigger than ever .
in fact , many of you navigated here today with the help of your tomtom or your smartphone .
it 's not just that you 'll never lose your wallet or your keys anymore , or your child when you 're at disneyland .
" they 're not sure this rises to the level of harassment , and they 're not set up technically to find the device . "
its jamming signals don 't stop at the edge of your personal space or at the edge of your car .
at this point , the game is over .
they 'd say , " here you are . here you are . "
the gps dot will fundamentally reorder your life .
this is paldin .
so i was going in , interviewing these people and doing their portraits .
and this area of the ecuadorian amazon -- oil was discovered in 1972 .
i wanted him to get an experience in the islamic world and i also wanted him to -- i was going there to work with a group , do a story on a group called the kalash , that are a group of animists , 3,000 animists , that live -- very small area -- surrounded by islam -- there 's 3,000 of these kalash left ; they 're incredible people .
and this is -- i see this rolling out all over -- this is our site in ollantaytambo , peru , four years ago , where they first saw their first computers ; now they have computers in their classrooms .
and this is a study that was just done a couple of years ago .
either way , mosquitos find us in the dark by sniffing us out . they smell us .
we tried , with a tiny little piece of limburger cheese , which smells badly after feet , to attract african malaria mosquitos .
and then you see the dog . it 's called tweed . it 's a border collie .
don 't worry , i do this all the time in the lab .
so it started over here .
just assorted garage sale junk , because i 'm a pack rat . "
because you have to base it on a yes or no .
just wanted to say , " hey guys .
this was on delta 719 going from jfk to san francisco .
so not only that i 'm giving this information here and there , but now there 's a third party , an independent third party , my bank , that 's verifying that , yes indeed , i was there at this time .
so you get something like this .
it 's actually quite user-unfriendly .
so in a way , i 'm glad that i 'm completely obsolete .
i think they kind of like to look at art .
and basically , what i 'd like to tell you is that power is changing , and there are two types of changes i want to discuss .
the technology was there .
you can do it with threats of coercion , " sticks , " you can do it with payments , " carrots , " or you can do it by getting others to want what you want .
in the 1980s , as america went through a transition in the reagan period , between the rust belt economy of the midwest to the silicon valley economy of california , that was the end of america .
doesn 't tell you much about military power , doesn 't tell you very much about soft power .
it 's bad history .
another way of putting it is that as we think of power in the 21st century , we want to get away from the idea that power 's always zero sum -- my gain is your loss and vice versa .
so if one looks at the statements that have been made about this , i am impressed that when hillary clinton described the foreign policy of the obama administration , she said that the foreign policy of the obama administration was going to be smart power , as she put it , " using all the tools in our foreign policy tool box . "
so eric had an initial design idea for a robot , but we didn 't have all the parts figured out , so we did what anybody would do in our situation : we asked the internet for help .
did you find the gold ?
i 'd like you to put this kind of knee-jerk reaction in the context of what you would have thought if you had found your girl playing sudoku or your boy reading shakespeare . right ?
the first way is that they 're actually able to resolve small detail in the context of clutter , and though that means being able to read the fine print on a prescription rather than using magnifier glasses , you can actually do it with just your eyesight .
so clearly playing those action games doesn 't lead to attention problems .
the other one is the frontal lobe , which controls how we sustain attention , and another one is the anterior cingulate , which controls how we allocate and regulate attention and resolve conflict .
the other lesson is that general wisdom carries no weight .
third . good ! this is hard , right ?
sw : this is einstein . can you tell everyone " hi " ?
she thinks burt rutan is very impressive .
e : ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh .
what do you say to a good-looking man ?
e : tweet , tweet , tweet .
e : superstar .
the first , to my mind , is what i call as " the ideas that have arrived . "
one is in the south and in the west of india , which is already going to be fully expensed by 2015 , because in that part of the country , the fertility rate is almost equal to that of a west european country .
and therefore technology has gone from being seen as something forbidding and intimidating to something that is empowering .
but now i believe it 's reached a point where it has become very important .
and i think now you 're seeing the move towards improving our cities .
this needs to be fixed because unless you can bring these people into the formal workforce , you will end up creating a whole lot of people who are completely disenfranchised .
similarly today in the west you 're seeing the problem of entitlement -- the cost of social security , the cost of medicare , the cost of medicaid .
and that makes a huge difference .
let me tell you my story .
soon it started to bring results .
did design do this ?
you can have no budgets , no people -- but still can put your work to the highest possible level .
but again , i didn 't know it was going to be a long goodbye .
i realized i couldn 't survive much longer this way .
my father tried very hard to motivate me into studying , but it didn 't work .
that chicken wing changed my life .
thank you .
robbie mizzone : thank you .
and i was actually rowing for my school here until this fateful day , and i flipped over right in front of the entire school .
you had to have an even better imagination to play this game , " death rider . "
it grows every year .
you have to remember that this is not a real island .
now , chris told me that you had a timeline video a few years ago here just to show how video game graphics have been improving .
so this is a student 's opinion on what his experience of games are .
a generation who may experience much more meaning through video games than they will through the real world .
no buttons to push , no triggers to pull , just me and the game .
i 'm not sure what the implications of my experience are , but the potential for using realistic video game stimuli in repetition on a vast number of loyal participants is frightening to me .
who is that going to come from ?
and as i 've shown here , we have the audience .
let me , let me push the button . "
or , to be more precise , how do most of the women in the world wash ?
look here , you see the seven billion people up there : the air people , the wash people , the bulb people and the fire people .
and these people , they want the washing machine .
if you have democracy , people will vote for washing machines .
the oceans cover some 70 percent of our planet .
and so what did we find ?
so fishermen could only catch what they could either eat or sell that day .
so these are tethered vehicles we lower down to the sea floor where they 're our eyes and our hands for working on the sea bottom .
and then at some period of time it pops up to the surface and , again , relays that data back to shore .
now what you can see is we 've sampled the area in the north atlantic , in the north sea in particular , and also the east coast of north america fairly well .
now while a lot of the species we discovered in the census are things that are small and hard to see , that certainly wasn 't always the case .
so now they know that , in fact , animals can live without oxygen , at least some of them , and that they can adapt to even the harshest of conditions .
and what is does is predict how many more species there are on land and in the ocean .
for example , these tuna that were once so abundant in the north sea are now effectively gone .
i 'm going to , instead , in a minute or two , show you an early , crude video because i think it 's a better way to tell a story .
" oh , by the way dean . it 's going to fit on a 50th percentile female frame -- namely 32 inches from the long finger -- and weigh less than nine pounds . "
look what it takes to make things like ipods .
so , can we see that ?
we 're probably going to have to give them support , encouragement .
i lost my right arm , but i 'm a lefty . "
we go back to walter reed , and a kid , literally , 20 some-odd days before that was blown up .
so , i was on my way out here .
i don 't know the answers .
but while we have the luxury of whining and complaining about who 's paying for what and how much we get , the people that are out there giving us that great privilege of whining and complaining , i know what they deserve : everything humanly possible .
they 're called the cchr .
it looks like a giant hampton inn .
he said , " i asked to see the prison psychiatrist .
it 's just impossible . "
classic psychopath -- it speaks to grandiosity and also lack of empathy .
i said , " could i come and interview you in prison to find out it you 're psychopaths ? "
for instance , one famous story about him , somebody came up to him and said , " i 've just bought myself a new car . "
he said he got accepted into west point , and they don 't let delinquents in west point .
he said , " you know what , one of the items on the checklist is lack of remorse , but another item on the checklist is cunning , manipulative .
unfortunately , after 20 months , he did go back to jail for a month .
this is bad ?
that 's why in june of this year , we passed , as a species , 51 percent of us living in cities , and bustees , and slums , and shantytowns .
some are weather-related , human-rights related , epidemics .
looking at the five major rivers that feed bangladesh .
you just need to look at the list of nobel laureates to remind ourselves .
six months ago , a group of business activists gathered together to join with the republican governor in california to pass ab 32 , the most far-reaching legislation in environmental history .
it 's not ancient history .
our bodies are home to trillions of microbes , and these creatures define who we are .
if you look inside the restrooms , they all have really similar ecosystems , and if you were to look inside the classrooms , those also have similar ecosystems .
i am collaborating with charlie brown .
wouldn 't it be awesome if we all had blis on our phones ?
after , there is the narcissistic design : it 's a fantastic designer who designs only for other fantastic designers .
and before , there was this soup , called " soupe primordiale , " this first soup -- bloop bloop bloop -- sort of dirty mud , no life , nothing .
you know , we mutate during four billion years before , but now , because it 's me , we stop . fin .
the more you will rise , the more you will be important for the civilization .
what , what else we can say about that ? why do that ?
forget all that . there is priority ; there is urgency .
with billions of people who have been born , worked , lived and died before us , these people who have worked so much , we have now bring beautiful things , beautiful gifts , we know so many things .
this has really invigorated me day-to-day , when i wake up , to try and do something interesting with my day .
and i found that it 's actually been very , very important to record even just that one second of a really bad moment .
every one of these little blobs is a galaxy roughly the size of our milky way -- a hundred billion stars in each of those blobs .
the air in this room is very smooth .
a low entropy configuration is one in which there 's only a few arrangements that look that way .
in every one of these books , every one of these sets of lectures , he emphasized this puzzle : why did the early universe have such a small entropy ?
for one thing , the universe will expand forever .
but that 's a probabilistic statement .
so boltzmann says , we will only live in the part of the multiverse , in the part of this infinitely big set of fluctuating particles , where life is possible .
and i would love to tell you the answer , but i 'm running out of time .
you might say , " well there 's nothing there to be living , " but that 's not right .
this is a prediction . i might be wrong .
right . now , when -- it 's interesting that when we look at an image we see , you know , color , depth , texture . and you can look at this whole scene and analyze it . you can see the woman is in closer than the wall and so forth . but the whole thing is actually flat . it 's painted . it 's trompe l 'oeil .
and it 's interesting , by doing this in this sort of rendered fashion , how much stronger the illusions are . any case , i hope this has brought you a little joy and happiness , and if you 're interested in seeing more cool effects , see me outside . i 'd be happy to show you lots of things .
wk : in fact , a design of the windmill that was in the book , it has got four -- ah -- three blades , and mine has got four blades .
wk : yeah .
wk : thank you .
right there .
i 'm going to make a cut right there .
i 'd like to talk today about the two biggest social trends in the coming century , and perhaps in the next 10,000 years .
and it goes like this . it 's by a guy called yuan chen : " i cannot bear to put away the bamboo sleeping mat .
and last but not least , it is an obsession .
the kind of mind -- part of the mind -- when you 're reaching for that piece of chocolate , when you want to win that promotion at work .
so with that preamble , i want to go into discussing the two most profound social trends .
we are seeing now one of the most remarkable traditions in the history of the human animal .
we sit around it and it shapes our minds .
i 'm always astonished when people come to me and say , " why is it that men are so adulterous ? "
so we 're seeing there 's a real extension of middle age .
it 's as if there 's a committee meeting going on in your head as you are trying to decide what to do .
not only do they suppress the dopamine circuit , but they kill the sex drive .
you fall in love with somebody who fits within what i call your " love map , " an unconscious list of traits that you build in childhood as you grow up .
these circuits are deeply embedded in the human brain .
and the ice that is there is quite thin .
these are animals that can practically swim from the equator to the poles and can crisscross entire oceans in the course of a year .
but before i went out to photograph this component , i sort of wrestled with the notion of how do you make a picture of a dead shark that will resonate with readers you know , i think there 's still a lot of people out there who think the only good shark is a dead shark .
this is the oceanic whitetip shark , an animal that is considered the fourth most dangerous species , if you pay attention to such lists .
in the pacific , where i made this photograph , their stocks have declined about 90 percent in the last 15 years .
72 percent of the population has such scars , but most don 't shed the gear , things like lobster traps and crab pots .
for example , these fish predate on sea urchins , and when the fish were all gone , all anyone ever saw underwater was just acres and acres of sea urchins .
i find weather extremely fascinating .
when you step closer , you actually see that it is indeed all made up of numbers .
and not everyone has a ph.d. in science .
in 1895 , lord kelvin declared that heavier-than-air flying machines were impossible .
today , we don 't talk about flying transonically , or even supersonically , we talk about flying hypersonically -- not mach 2 or mach 3 , mach 20 .
you can 't learn to fly at mach 20 unless you fly .
failure is part of creating new and amazing things .
what if we could use these electromagnetic pulses as beacons , beacons in a moving network of powerful transmitters ?
the internet is home to two billion people , or 30 percent of the world 's population .
so go ahead , ask yourself , what would you attempt to do if you knew you could not fail ?
" there is only time enough to iron your cape and back to the skies for you . "
we 've got to fly it first .
well look , our singular mission is the creation and prevention of strategic surprise .
i had a fire nine days ago .
i called my sister . i called my neighbors . i said , " come dig . "
the negatives are gone .
and we have two main tools available at our disposal .
we need to design , build and engineer a home away from home for the cells .
there 's air flowing through the top channel , and then we flow a liquid that contains nutrients through the blood channel .
mucus traps particulates , viruses , potential allergens , and these little cilia move and clear the mucus out .
does it have a toxicity ?
we have engineers , we have cell biologists , we have clinicians , all working together .
well , we could imagine one day having geraldine on a chip , having danielle on a chip , having you on a chip .
there was one held in detroit here last summer , and it will be held again next summer , at the henry ford .
now this one takes a little bit of explaining .
they 're a little bit radical .
and i talked to his mom , and i ended up doing a story on him for a magazine called kidrobot .
and you can 't see this very well on the screen , but arduino -- arduino is an open-source hardware platform .
this is a radar speed detector that was developed from a hot wheels toy .
thank you very much .
court : where ?
and it particularly don 't feed your spliff habit .
marcus : when a man resorts to profanities , it 's a sure sign of his inability to express himself .
what the fuck are you talking about ?
and then , the third piece . the third piece for me is the question : what is cinema to you ? what do you do with cinema ?
we went from one village to another -- three villages .
i 'm interested .
mr. ezra gelehun , please stand .
ask if anyone in this room have ever seen real diamond before ?
eo : well , we thank you again for coming to the ted stage .
and for all three of these , i believe , biomimicry has a lot of the solutions that we 're going to need .
and with less overall weight in the superstructure , there were big savings in the foundations .
so it transformed a linear process into a closed-loop model , and it created more value in the process .
the more vegetation we lose , the more that 's likely to exacerbate climate change and lead to further desertification .
this photograph was taken on completion day , and just one year later , it looked like that .
and with biomimicry , if you 've got an underutilized resource , you don 't think , " how am i going to dispose of this ? "
and i firmly believe that studying the way nature solves problems will provide a lot of the solutions .
i graduated .
and for those of you whose lives have been touched by mental illness , you know how challenging it can be .
and i went onstage to accept a webby award for best blog .
the second " a " is awareness .
here he is pictured with the " fearsome foursome . "
i don 't know what it would feel like coming to a new country when you 're in your mid-20s .
he would say , " look , can you believe they have a mango here from mexico ?
you can watch a horror movie with monsters .
the first was , instead of the months flying by , forgotten , the time was much more memorable .
i learned that when i made small , sustainable changes , things i could keep doing , they were more likely to stick .
it 's the hollowing out of small towns .
racially , the county is about 60 percent african-american , but what happens in the public schools is most of the privileged white kids go to the private lawrence academy .
i have strategically cut matt 's head out of this photo , because he would kill me if he knew i was using it because of the sweatsuits .
this is in response to the awful mobile trailers and the outdated textbooks and the terrible materials that we 're building schools out of these days .
this is the most complex .
and in recent decades , a lot of the funding for shop class has gone away entirely .
and then this is anthony .
but as you look at it , i hope you 'll begin to feel just slightly uneasy .
and where you have slightly more complex things , you can get slightly more complex things .
and it 's expanding at incredible speed .
and each cloud is compacted , gravity gets more powerful as density increases , the temperature begins to rise at the center of each cloud , and then , at the center of each cloud , the temperature crosses the threshold temperature of 10 million degrees , protons start to fuse , there 's a huge release of energy , and , bam !
now , what are the ideal conditions for chemistry ?
you don 't stabilize the individual ; you stabilize the template , the thing that carries information , and you allow the template to copy itself .
sixty-five million years ago , an asteroid landed on earth near the yucatan peninsula , creating conditions equivalent to those of a nuclear war , and the dinosaurs were wiped out .
we evolved as a species in the savanna lands of africa , but then you see humans migrating into new environments , into desert lands , into jungles , into the ice age tundra of siberia -- tough , tough environment -- into the americas , into australasia .
if we avoid that trap , others are waiting for us .
he likes to say , " you wouldn 't like me when i 'm angry , " quoting hulk from the movie , but i 've never seen him angry .
we 're doing changing media .
this is a little spot that we filmed there that 's to be displayed on the large jumbotrons in singapore .
great person .
what it was , was the 20th anniversary of the siege , the beginning of the siege of sarajevo , and i don 't like the word " anniversary , " because it sounds like a party , and this was not a party .
you 're not allowed to identify anyone by ethnicity , which is , of course , what started the slaughter in the first place .
i 'm not a u.n. conflict resolution person .
now bring it out , bring it out . anybody else ?
audience : 25 .
thank you very much .
audience : oh , 722 .
yes .
good . then i shall attempt the impossible -- or at least the improbable .
for my next number -- while i mentally recharge my batteries , i have one more question for the audience .
february what ? audience : sixth .
audience : april . april what ?
now , i have to apologize to our magician friend lennart green .
this is a phonetic code , a mnemonic device that i use , that allows me to convert numbers into words .
now , one thing about being a twin is that it makes you an expert at spotting favoritism .
and yet , even though there are scientifically proven techniques we could use to treat these kinds of psychological injuries , we don 't .
i knew he would call in the morning , but that night was one of the saddest and longest nights of my life .
it even suppress the functioning of your immune system , making you vulnerable to all kinds of illnesses and diseases .
because if your mind tries to convince you you 're incapable of something and you believe it , then like those two toddlers , you 'll begin to feel helpless and you 'll stop trying too soon , or you won 't even try at all .
and you have to break this kind of negative cycle before it begins .
you wouldn 't get a cut on your arm and decide , " oh , i know !
and i couldn 't stop thinking about what he was going through .
if they were happier and more fulfilled ?
we don 't run around emitting ultrasonic squeaks , like bats .
we recognize them by the experiences , and we abstract them into symbols .
for everybody who does not know the public transport here in dublin , essentially we have this system of local buses that grew with the city . for every outskirt that was added , there was another bus route added running from the outskirt all the way to the city center , and as these local buses approach the city center , they all run side by side , and converge in pretty much one main street .
so here 's what we did .
the reactions i got were tremendous . it was really good to see .
but from the japanese perspective , it 's their duty to protect those who don 't know any better -- in this case , the ignorant gaijin -- from making the wrong choice .
now when the third group came in , they were told that their anagrams and their markers had been chosen by their mothers .
it requires that everyone treat choice as a private and self-defining act .
combine this with the assumption that more choices are always better , and you have a group of people for whom every little difference matters and so every choice matters .
choice no longer offers opportunities , but imposes constraints .
in a study i conducted with simona botti and kristina orfali , american and french parents were interviewed .
we live entirely by the imposition of a narrative line upon disparate images , by the idea with which we have learned to freeze the shifting phantasmagoria , which is our actual experience . "
if we learn to speak to one another , albeit through translation , then we can begin to see choice in all its strangeness , complexity and compelling beauty .
what 's different about them ? "
and then you have the emerging world cities , with a mixed variety of vehicles , mixed land-use patterns , also rather dispersed but often with a very dense urban core .
and these red dots show the most congested parts , which are the bridges that lead into the inner city .
and personally , i would like to do this every once a year or so , but they won 't let me do that .
each day , people make new decisions , and people change and the world changes around them , and each day all of these decisions are sort of nudged ever so slightly away from rush hour car driving in a way that people don 't even notice .
let 's talk a little bit about how nuclear fission works .
it 's made into a grade where it 's not usable for a nuclear weapon , but they love this stuff .
well , uranium dioxide 's a ceramic , and ceramic doesn 't like releasing what 's inside of it .
it 's a way to bring power to the developing world , because it 's produced in a factory and it 's cheap .
i graduated high school in may , and -- — i graduated high school in may , and i decided that i was going to start up a company to commercialize these technologies that i 've developed , these revolutionary detectors for scanning cargo containers and these systems to produce medical isotopes , but i want to do this , and i 've slowly been building up a team of some of the most incredible people i 've ever had the chance to work with , and i 'm really prepared to make this a reality .
these routes to happiness haven 't really increased happiness very much .
i also put in here the stress response .
and of course we know this intuitively , that happiness is not just the absence of misery .
we have basically at least two systems here , and they both are very ancient .
so you see , even 10-month-old babies , when they see their mother , will show this particular kind of smile .
the other thing is , that a piece of evidence is , is if you look at computerized text analysis of people who commit suicide , what you find there , and it 's quite interesting , is use of the first person singular -- " i , " " me , " " my , " not " we " and " us " -- and the letters are less hopeless than they are really alone .
the data isn 't terribly supportive of money buying happiness .
i end with a few quotes .
it 's been eight years , and i can tell you that i didn 't go to china to become a lawyer .
and then i go to china and i stand on a stage at a university and i bust out into a song in chinese and everybody sings along and they roar with delight at this girl with the hair and the instrument , and she 's singing their music .
at the same time , i run a website on cool tools , where i issue a daily obsession of the latest things in technology .
so he 's saying , what do genes want ? the selfish gene .
but a more interesting way , the current way to take the long view , is to look at it in an evolutionary perspective .
they never touch the inner matter . there is more and more co-evolution .
and so it would be sort of approximately up there , coming out of the animal kingdom . and if we were to do that , we would find out -- we could actually approach technology in this way .
all of them are still being produced . so you 've got corn shellers .
that is what we call an " infinite game . "
we want a trillion zillion species of one individuals .
i 'm a multitasking person , and i push my students to fly through a very creative , multitasking design process .
in 1931 , my grandmother -- bottom left for you guys over here -- graduated from the eighth grade .
they checked schedules . they were meeting with secretaries .
the problem then becomes how do you take seventh- and eighth-graders to a talk about genocide and deal with the subject in a way that is responsible and respectful , and they know what to do with it .
so we did this project , and this is one of the artifacts of the project .
and they 're like , " oh , that one wasn 't so awesome . "
and so we have to understand not only why tech 's important , where it 's going , but also , very importantly , when -- the timing is everything .
after it falls below a critical price , it will tend , if it 's successful , to rise above a critical mass , a penetration .
that gave an advantage ; that was an implication of the technology 's rise that wasn 't obvious to everybody .
in january 2000 , the price was 10,000 dollars , or 27 dollars a day .
it 's the first radical change in automobile technology in 100 years .
i mean , you know , the music industry is imploding in front of our very eyes , and hollywood 's worried as well .
so there has been a lot of change .
slim and his friends went through the country and pasted hundreds of photos everywhere to show the diversity in the country .
while in iran at the same time abololo -- of course a nickname -- has pasted one single face of a woman to show his resistance against the government .
maybe not in one year . that 's the beginning .
so you go to the literature .
when we slow it down 50 times we see how the leg is hitting that simulated debris .
it walks on two legs and it holds the other arms up in the air so that it can 't be seen .
and my assistant 's going to help me here .
a little better than nature .
the same is true when we looked at this lizard running on fluidized sand .
this is when its foot 's in the air .
they peel away from the surface like you 'd peel away a piece of tape .
i think this is an extraordinary example of how curiosity-based research -- we just wondered how they climbed up something -- can lead to things that you could never imagine .
and here 's cutkosky 's and his amazing students ' design .
now , that was before cassette tapes , c.d.s , dvds -- any of the cool stuff we 've got now .
a little bit of differential , but not much .
i think it 's wonderful ; i think sometimes people , when they get educated , lose it : they get so smart they 're unwilling to look at things that they know better than .
they have literally beat a path to our door .
instead of being made on the face of the cone , it 's made at literally billions of little independent points along this narrow column in the air , and so when i aim it towards you , what you hear is made right next to your ears .
we make a version with this which puts out 155 decibels .
so , i 've been really lucky as an inventor .
i remember i was about 13 , glued to a grainy black and white television in my parents ' living room as soviet tanks rolled into budapest , and kids not much older than me were throwing themselves at the tanks and getting mown down .
and they did it in a total devotion to non-violence .
so what about our fear ?
but anger as an engine -- in an engine -- is powerful .
and the kind of thing they 're doing is demobilizing militias , rebuilding economies , resettling refugees , even liberating child soldiers .
dictatorships in czechoslovakia , east germany , estonia , latvia , lithuania , mali , madagascar , poland , the philippines , serbia , slovenia , i could go on , and now tunisia and egypt .
i don 't have children .
this is five dangerous things .
and it shows that kids can develop an extended sense of self through a tool at a very young age .
break the digital millennium copyright act .
and i 've had some incredible warm-up acts .
bring it over here and open it up . aaaah !
and it 's by a guy named pastor rick warren , and it 's called " the porpoise driven life . "
uses very , very little power .
day three .
no , i said what 's your favorite song ?
from dutch to [ korean ] , into " hordahordaneecheewa . "
and the wonderful thing about the new bookstore is , it 's going to be shaped in a spiral that 's organized by the dewey decimal system .
back in 1968 , you can see that the mountain range of brokeback mountain was covered in 151 inches of snow pack .
both were very young countries then , and full of hope for the future .
he said , " ok . i measured the height of a brick .
and when i try to explain my work to her , she waved away all the details , and she said , " neil , there 's only one question that really matters .
well , i got interested in this because it seemed to me that it was an obvious question .
and we try to convince ourselves -- we really try to convince ourselves they 're wrong .
well , here 's the number of physicians in africa .
it 's an 80-room art deco hotel from the 1920s .
the students don 't usually leave the computer lab till 2 or 3 a.m.
we had some of the students filmed at home before they came to aims .
he 's about to finish his ph.d. , and he was filmed recently with someone you all know .
well , i said we also have a plan . and our plan is quite simple .
and we summarize them this way : the institutes have got to be relevant , innovative , cost-effective and high quality . why ?
zoom into it and see where it was taken .
open it up .
when people think about making pan-viral detection reagents , usually it 's the fast-evolving problem that 's an issue , because how can we detect things if they 're always changing ?
here 's the section on the all-important emergency stop switch .
polio and rhino : they 're in the same family , very close to each other .
well , it 's pretty simple .
remember , our evolutionary-conserved sequences we 're using on this array allow us to detect even novel or uncharacterized viruses , because we pick what is conserved throughout evolution .
so let 's do something a little bit harder .
you do an open lung biopsy when you 've got no other options .
clearly , we have a case of a healthy person that 's going down .
its closest relative is , in fact , from mice , and so we would call this a xenotropic retrovirus , because it 's infecting a species other than mice .
it 's a pleasure to be here in edinburgh , scotland , the birthplace of the needle and syringe .
now , these are two things that you probably may have heard of , but there are two other shortcomings of the needle and syringe you may not have heard about .
so that gives you an idea of the nanopatch , and immediately you can see some key advantages .
as one example , in the brown layer there 's a certain type of cell called a langerhans cell -- every square millimeter of our body is jammed full of those langerhans cells , those immune cells , and there 's others shown as well that we haven 't stained in this image .
that 's a real fresh opportunity .
within my lab we 've shown that we can keep the vaccine stored at 23 degrees celsius for more than a year without any loss in activity at all .
now standing here today in front of you at the birthplace of the needle and syringe , a device that 's 160 years old , i 'm presenting to you an alternative approach that could really help make that happen -- and it 's the nanopatch with its attributes of being needle-free , pain-free , the ability for removing the cold chain and improving the immunogenicity .
the filmmaker mira nair speaks about growing up in a small town in india . its name is bhubaneswar , and here 's a picture of one of the temples in her town .
richard serra : i was standing there looking at it , and i realized that velázquez was looking at me , and i thought , " oh . i 'm the subject of the painting . "
and i asked her , " what would happen if i was a member of the press ? " and she told me , " oh , look back there , " and back a block was the press corps tied up in a little penned-in area , and i said , " well , when do they go in ? "
i want to leave you with another image of a japanese tea bowl . this one is at the freer gallery in washington , d.c.
i looked at slaves . i met slaveholders , and i looked very deeply into slave-based businesses because this is an economic crime .
well , it builds up with these factors .
they take it for a little while , but when they try to leave , bang ! , the hammer comes down , and they discover they 're enslaved .
africans and indians , as usual , south americans , and eastern europeans in particular are on our buy list .
there are no roads there , so they carry loads of stone on their backs , often of their own weight , up and down the himalaya mountains .
we do not buy people out of slavery .
four million people were lifted up out of slavery and then dumped .
and we 've got to say , what good is all of our intellectual and political and economic power -- and i 'm really thinking intellectual power in this room -- if we can 't use it to bring slavery to an end ?
what 's happened since the book came out -- the book was mainly about research in biomimicry -- and what 's happened since then is architects , designers , engineers -- people who make our world -- have started to call and say , we want a biologist to sit at the design table to help us , in real time , become inspired .
you know , it 's a silo , people in silos . they didn 't know that the same thing was happening . so one of them thought about it and said , ok , well , if this is just crystallization that happens automatically out of seawater -- self-assembly -- then why aren 't shells infinite in size ? what stops the scaling ?
that 's on the software side . but what 's interesting to me is that we haven 't looked at this , as much . i mean , these machines are really not very high tech in my estimation in the sense that there 's dozens and dozens of carcinogens in the water in silicon valley .
and thirdly , how does life make things disappear into systems ?
here 's an interesting one for the it world : bio-silicon . this is a diatom , which is made of silicates .
that 's very exciting for fuel cells -- to be able to do that without platinum .
we do chemistry in organic solvents .
luckily , there are millions and millions of geniuses willing to gift us with their best ideas .
our farming has done the opposite .
i 'm sorry , there 's nothing normal about this .
how is that possible ?
as we were working on this , it dawned on us : this is taking infrared radiation , wavelengths , and converting it into electrons .
each of us , every day , need just eight glasses of this , because we 're human .
you don 't have enough time .
isn 't life about the journey , not really the destination ?
none of us ever get through this life without heartache , without turmoil , and if you believe and you have faith and you can get knocked down and get back up again and you believe in perseverance as a great human quality , you find your way , and bonnie grabbed my shoulders , and she said , " let 's find our way to florida . "
i mean , how long did it take them to build that ?
well , they were just there for 53 hours , and i was there for years .
and the third thing i said on that beach was , " it looks like the most solitary endeavor in the world , and in many ways , of course , it is , and in other ways , and the most important ways , it 's a team , and if you think i 'm a badass , you want to meet bonnie . "
i was worried about my own vagina .
" hurry , nurse , bring the vagina . "
but i want to talk a little bit about happiness and the relationship to this whole vagina journey because it has been an extraordinary journey that began eight years ago .
and it turned out , after thinking and investigating , that i discovered -- and the un has actually said this recently -- that one out of every three women on this planet will be beaten or raped in her lifetime .
what has also happened is in the course of these travels -- and it 's been an extraordinary thing -- is that every single place that i have gone to in the world , i have met a new species .
i was beaten by my husband for five years .
and everyone was supposed to be happy in that community and , in fact , my life was hell . i lived with an alcoholic father who beat me and molested me , and it was all inside that .
when i was a kid growing up in the south bronx , inner-city ghetto in new york , i was surrounded by evil , as all kids are who grew up in an inner city .
he didn 't do a good job of keeping it there though .
because everybody has a digital camera or cell phone camera , they took pictures of everything . more than 1,000 .
because " what " could be the who of people , but it could also be the what of the situation , and obviously that 's wrongheaded .
so my book , " the lucifer effect , " recently published , is about , how do you understand how good people turn evil ?
the learner 's a genial , middle-aged guy .
ok . here 's the data . they could not be more wrong .
randomly assigned them to be prisoner and guard .
they strip them naked . they sexually taunt them .
mindlessly taking the first small step .
he gave the guards permission to do those things , and they knew nobody was ever going to come down to that dungeon .
he was the one that stopped those abuses you saw , because when he saw those images , he turned them over to a senior investigating officer .
you 've got to act when other people are passive .
path two , you become guilty of the evil of passive inaction .
that 's the kind of power i feel in this room .
fair enough .
or should we leave him alone ?
or maybe we punt -- ask the legal department , see what they say .
in math , we know the objective facts .
he wants objective truths .
it 's not like its relation to some abstract form .
he said we should use our reason to figure out the rules by which we should guide our conduct , and then it is our duty to follow those rules .
happily , we 're not machines , and we can do it .
now the next step -- try this .
that 's interesting .
that 's where i live , and it 's my university as well .
and there was a wasp 's nest that i had let grow in my yard , right outside my door .
what i 'd like to do is show you a few of the things that they 're learning .
it actually basks . it 's a slow-moving shark .
there is now a cement manufacturing company starting in the united states called calera .
they export water molecules through , and leave solutes on the other side .
in fact , sulfur-reducing bacteria , as part of their synthesis , they will emit , as a byproduct , nanoparticles into the water .
these wind turbines can rotate in incredibly slow windspeeds , as a result .
and what we 're trying to do , in a tedesque way , is to organize all biological information by design and engineering function .
but also kinsey interviewed a woman who could be brought to orgasm by having someone stroke her eyebrow .
and i said to her , " are you just doing this all the time ? "
i said to her , " you should do an experiment .
in the 1900s , early 1900s gynecologists , a lot of gynecologists believed that when a woman has an orgasm the contractions serve to suck the semen up through the cervix and sort of deliver it really quickly to the egg , thereby upping the odds of conception .
you may be wondering , " how do you make artificial semen ? "
so uh , okay .
so possibly , you know , a little more arousing than it looks .
this was not idle curiosity .
and you know , it 's amazing .
and what happened was , because they could afford it sometimes , sometimes not , i got kicked out pretty much every term .
they called me two weeks later , they 're like , oh , yeah , you can come now . and i told them to stuff it .
he got sick again . he got sick on a friday .
i was actually crying during his presentation .
what are we doing ?
one is because i 'm pretty aggressive , and i try and find , you know , opportunities .
another thing is that these leaders are a reflection of our society .
my cousin ran out of school fees , and she 's really smart .
and i 'm like , " because i 'm here and it 's cheap , and you know , i kind of like pittsburgh . "
thank you .
transferred to a larger scale -- actually a lot larger , with a lot of help -- 14,064 bicycle reflectors -- a 20-day install .
thank you very much . thanks .
rm : thanks .
for example , molecular structure .
here is thomas mann talking about symmetry in " the magic mountain . "
you see it already . immediately you go in , the reflective symmetry in the water .
so i 'm going to take you through , perhaps push you a little bit mathematically -- so brace yourselves -- push you a little bit to understand how this language works , which enables us to capture what is symmetry .
but now this has some reflectional symmetry .
well let 's do that . a sixth of a turn , followed by a third of a turn , the combined effect is as if i had just rotated it by half a turn in one go .
take a beer mat and rotate it by a quarter of a turn , then flip it . and then do it in the other order , and the picture will be facing in the opposite direction .
now , let 's move to the very different-looking wall in the alhambra .
but here is the language which describes how the symmetries interact .
20 digits or less , sit down .
it 's all the unanswered questions which make mathematics a living subject .
there 's the glamour of physics .
there was a tremendous amount of technical achievement associated with creating this hollywood glamour .
this is filippino lippi 's 1543 portrait of saint apollonia .
glamour is all about transcending this world and getting to an idealized , perfect place .
and sprezzatura is the art that conceals art .
this is the most glamorous picture , i think , ever .
the perfect getaway in your perfect car .
because what they 're doing is they 're saying , your coat 's not so glamorous , what 's been edited out is something important .
and that has a fascination .
now , the end product of that action is up on the board here .
the guy went up and started dickering , and 10 dollars later , we had four camels .
i want you to get as close to that camel as you possibly can . "
the desert 's extremely windy as well as being very cold .
you can actually see , right here , it will vibrate .
jasmine has been his mate for some time .
leathery chest pads that beat the heat .
bedouins call the camel the gift of god .
turn and face your neighbors .
and you need some design to be successful .
now the very easy and simple technology which was developed actually runs after this formula .
and two tastes which protect you -- bitter and sour , which are against poisonous and rotten material .
i took the three elements -- stomach , small intestine and colon .
i took here a model from robotics -- it 's called the subsumption architecture .
so now back to the cooking question and back to the design .
so , to make cooking really a very important element , i would say even philosophers have to change and have to finally recognize that cooking is what made us .
so you 'll see images of this remarkable building .
moshe safdie : he was a real nomad .
very pleased to welcome you back .
there is no other shortcut , no other way to really understand him .
i think it was my longstanding desire to bring together my interest in art , science and philosophy that allowed me to be ready when the proverbial light bulb went on .
so i 'm not sure if there are any in this photo , but i do know the fungus is down there .
the location of this tree is actually kept secret for its own protection .
and you know , i think of all of these organisms as palimpsests .
the tree can easily recover .
this is a map that i 've put together of the oldest living things , so you can get a sense of where they are ; you see they 're all over the world .
and i followed this one pig with number " 05049 , " all the way up until the end and to what products it 's made of .
of course , the bone in fine-bone china gives it its translucency and also its strength , in order to make these really fine shapes , like this deer .
this is a bullet coming from a very large ammunition company in the united states .
well it is , because everything that can 't be used for anything else is made into a fuel that can be used as renewable energy source .
and this has always been the case , throughout history .
and that means visual intelligence software will need to scan it for items of interest .
cell phone geolocation , telecom metadata , social media , email , text , financial transaction data , transportation data , it 's a wealth of real-time data on the movements and social interactions of people .
this temporarily effectively banned autonomous weapons in the u.s. military , but that directive needs to be made permanent .
autonomous robotic weapons would concentrate too much power in too few unseen hands , and that would be corrosive to representative government .
since then , what 's happened ?
we need to get away from feeling , in the same way , human rights matters because of the other things it brings , or women 's rights matters for the other things it brings .
that can mean different things in different countries .
but what about how they behaved ? that 's what he wanted to know .
in chimpanzee society , we find many , many examples of compassion , precursors to love and true altruism .
ways of controlling , preventing soil erosion .
the problems in africa , however , as we 've been discussing for the whole of these first couple of days of ted , are major problems .
finally , all around the world , people have begun to believe that there is something going on very wrong with our climate .
hundreds and thousands of young people around the world can break through and can make this a better world for all living things .
once again , they 're useful members of society .
what we buy . what we wear .
people like this are the role models we need for young africans .
carl norden was born in 1880 .
it 's called the norden mark 15 bombsight .
well it allowed you to do that .
well in a real war , you can 't do that ; you 'll get shot down .
so why do we talk about the norden bombsight ?
the issue was they didn 't know where the scud launchers were .
we think the things we make can solve our problems , but our problems are much more complex than that .
so this is a model of the human brain , and this is prefrontal cortex , right at the front .
so in my lab , we bring adolescents and adults into the lab to have a brain scan , we give them some kind of task that involves thinking about other people , their minds , their mental states , their emotions , and one of the findings that we 've found several times now , as have other labs around the world , is part of the prefrontal cortex called medial prefrontal cortex , which is shown in blue on the slide , and it 's right in the middle of prefrontal cortex in the midline of your head .
in other words , everything you need to do in order to remember the rule and apply it seems to be fully developed by mid-adolescence , whereas in contrast , if you look at the last two gray bars , there 's still a significant improvement in the director condition between mid-adolescence and adulthood , and what this means is that the ability to take into account someone else 's perspective in order to guide ongoing behavior , which is something , by the way , that we do in everyday life all the time , is still developing in mid-to-late adolescence .
all four of my grandparents , for example , left school in their early adolescence . they had no choice .
and that 's what makes computers powerful : these high-level languages that can be compiled .
and the neat thing is that if you change the sequence and change the spell , you just change the sequence of the staples .
and in terms of experience of capitalism , there are two aspects that the rest of the globe experiences .
my colleagues at johns hopkins were among the best .
the first challenge is to rethink , fundamentally , the issue of the time .
so , ashraf , until recently , you were the finance minister of afghanistan , a country right at the middle of much of the world 's agenda .
the united states , great britain , joined for instance , egyptian intelligence service to train thousands of people in resistance and urban terrorism .
and everybody was telling me it was a different world .
they don 't want to sell to the charity bazaars that are only for foreigners -- and the same bloody shirt embroidered time and again .
there 's an entire weight of history vis-a-vis aid that now needs to be reexamined .
and in this way i could find noor , the hidden light of afghanistan .
but all that aside , we still have a problem , and it 's a real problem .
how do we change these numbers at the top ?
two , make your partner a real partner .
and my brother says , " i got the top grade in the class . "
there 's a really good study that shows this really well .
and she said , " i learned something today .
and that 's a problem , because we have to make it as important a job , because it 's the hardest job in the world to work inside the home , for people of both genders , if we 're going to even things out and let women stay in the workforce .
and if two years ago you didn 't take a promotion and some guy next to you did , if three years ago you stopped looking for new opportunities , you 're going to be bored because you should have kept your foot on the gas pedal .
as christian iconography got changed , and swastikas were created out of crucifixes , batman and superman were created by jewish young men in the united states and canada , also going back to the bible .
so the librarians find out and they get together a special solution , a chemical solution called king 's water , that when mixed with 99 stones would be able to save all that culture and history in the books .
noor is arabic for light .
but this is not about religion , it 's not about proselytizing .
i came home to my wife and i said , " i created a character after you . "
" so when 's the article coming out ? "
so there 's a struggle within the team .
now , tell me which way to go .
and i took away the name of the writer , the name of the [ unclear ] -- everything was gone except the facts .
" yes , rayan , just go away . " he left his scooby doo in his house .
thank you very much .
what do i win if i convince you that utilitarianism isn 't really the right framework for thinking about ethical theories ?
you know , presenting a sound , well-argued , tight argument in english before a francophone audience just isn 't going to work .
and i think the argument-as-war metaphor inhibits those other kinds of resolutions to argumentation .
sure , you got some pleasure out of it , maybe your ego stroked , maybe you get some professional status in the field .
there 's the proponent and the opponent in an adversarial , dialectical argument .
you can make the baby poop .
we all had to fast during ramadan .
but they 're playing geopolitics .
and that meant she knew she only had one shot at collecting her data .
openness alone can 't drive change .
that means we have to resist the neurobiological drive , which means that we really prefer people mostly like ourselves , and it means we have to seek out people with different backgrounds , different disciplines , different ways of thinking and different experience , and find ways to engage with them .
because it does take skill and practice , too .
they think of him as a leader .
and what 's more , i 'm really lucky , because i get to share that with millions of people worldwide .
but technology alone isn 't enough .
this two-and-a-half-inch bat has a three-and-a-half-inch tongue , the longest relative to body length of any mammal in the world .
the stars themselves -- at 12,000 feet , the dry , thin air makes for perfect stargazing .
well , our approach to finding longevity was to team up with national geographic , and the national institute on aging , to find the four demographically confirmed areas that are geographically defined .
deprive your brain of oxygen for just a few minutes , those brain cells die , they never come back .
and here we have this area where men live the longest , about 10 times more centenarians than we have here in america .
this is a place where the oldest living female population is found .
it takes about a half hour for that full feeling to travel from your belly to your brain .
and one of the questions , they were very culturally astute , the people who put the questionnaire .

these 100-year-old okinawan women are getting up and down off the ground , they sit on the floor , 30 or 40 times a day .
they tend to eat a plant-based diet .
they don 't like that . they think it 's crank . i don 't think it 's crank .
now , for those of you who may not be familiar , bitcoin is a crypto-currency , a virtual currency , synthetic currency .
these are the more polite ones i could share with you today .
you know , when you are standing in line in starbucks , 30 percent of transactions in starbucks on any one day are actually being made with starbucks star points .
which backs up my point and shows he didn 't even break a sweat when he said that .
so that 's getting really interesting here , a really interesting dynamic going on .
i still start every day practicing playing bach .
but if we look at the human scale , there 's massive problems that aren 't being addressed by those nanoscale technologies .
and the idea is that you take the three-dimensional structure of a protein -- in this case it 's the crambin protein -- you take the backbone -- so no cross-linking , no environmental interactions -- and you break that down into a series of components .
so today for the first time , we 're unveiling a new project , which is a collaboration with stratasys , and it 's called 4d printing .
these are scenarios where it 's difficult to build , our current construction techniques don 't work , it 's too large , it 's too dangerous , it 's expensive , too many parts .
now , try to imagine 40 , 50 films wrapped , distributed , every week in the streets of lagos , nigeria and west africa .
here i can tell a story of africans making movies like i do , and actually i felt this was an inspiration for me .
and you shoot in seven days .
and consistently , they are glued to their screen whenever they see the story .
saint obi : i was so fascinated , you know , with those cowboy movies .
this ain 't going to be my last movie .
we didn 't have to tell to the nigerian filmmakers .
it 's not an added sequence , just some voices from nollywood .
so it 's safe to say that there are 2,000 films .
there is no life without stories .
so , i started taking art courses , and i found a way to make sculpture that brought together my love for being very precise with my hands , with coming up with different kinds of logical flows of energy through a system .
this next one here , " machine with wishbone , " it came about from playing with this wishbone after dinner .
so i 've invented it in concrete , because it doesn 't really matter .
so this is a little wire-bending tool .
and when i had this thought , i was imagining that i would make -- i would have a whole machine theater evening , where i would -- you would have an audience , the curtain would open , and you 'd be entertained by machines on stage .
what happens to education ?
when you take education and technology , then i find in the literature that , you know , things like websites , collaborative environments -- you 've been listening to all that in the morning -- it 's always piloted first in the best schools , the best urban schools , and , according to me , biases the result .
i 'll have to really rush through this . they 're a set of experiments .
he did that , and the internet explorer changed page .
and they said , " well , we 've picked it up from the cds . "
i couldn 't find a single correlation with anything , but it had to be in groups .
so what does the eight-year-old do ?
and you know about the internet-based self-organizing systems .
i was born in the 1970s , and john travolta was big in those days : " grease , " " saturday night fever , " and he provided a fantastic kind of male role model for me to start dancing . my parents were very up for me going .
i 'm not sure if this is going to be good or not .
and we 'll see what we come up with .
they start with small little units and build it up .
whoa , underneath , whoo-um . yeah ? underneath . jump .
ready and go ... um .
okay , you can open your eyes if you had them closed .
thank you . thank you .
be formless , shapeless , like water .
instead , people from across the road , they would shout things like -- hp and yr : arriba ! arriba ! ándale ! ándale !

nextpedition turns the trip into a game , with surprising twists and turns along the way .
they talk about wanting lives of purpose and greater meaning .

and together they started a book club for a hundred people in the slums , and they 're reading many ted authors and liking it .
and ultimately , we want to be part of a movement that is about measuring impact , measuring what is most important to us .
it was hard , it was a difficult road , but ultimately the leaders of the community came together , realizing we only have each other .
my final story is about a young , beautiful man named josephat byaruhanga , who was another acumen fund fellow , who hails from uganda , a farming community .
and it 's partly because i came to this field from a different background , chemist and a bacterial geneticist .
there it comes , these zeroes after zeroes after zeroes .
that means that microenvironment and the context which surrounds those cells actually are telling the cancer gene and the cancer cell what to do .
but how does context signal ?
well , it was wonderful . boggles my mind .
you need to always think , what else needs to be discovered ?
and here is merce cunningham , i was fortunate to dance with him when i was younger , and here he is a dancer , and while he is dancing , he is both the dancer and the dance .
why don 't we start there ?
and , you know , people said , " aimee , you know , you 've got speed -- you 've got natural speed -- but you don 't have any skill or finesse going down that track .
and i said , " no , come on . "
my pleas fell on deaf ears , thank god .
and i 'm sure of it , you know ?
you know , i 'd never lost anything , like , whether it would be the scholarship or , you know , i 'd won five golds when i skied . in everything , i came in first .
and that was this collective glory -- that there was , you know , 50 people behind me that had joined in this incredible experience of going to atlanta .
ok , now , these are my sprinting legs , made of carbon graphite , like i said , and i 've got to make sure i 've got the right socket .
but actually these , like i said , are still the actual prototype .
i mean , what happened was , two years ago this man in belgium was saying , " god , if i can go to madame tussauds ' wax museum and see jerry hall replicated down to the color of her eyes , looking so real as if she breathed , why can 't they build a limb for someone that looks like a leg , or an arm , or a hand ? "
my name is joshua walters .
there 's a movement going on right now to reframe mental illness as a positive -- at least the hypomanic edge part of it .
how much depends on how lucky you are .
this is a body of knowledge , method , skill and principle that we threw in the garbage after world war ii and decided we don 't need that anymore ; we 're not going to use it .
it is emphatically an outdoor public room .
this is it on a smaller scale : the back of the civic center in my town , saratoga springs , new york .
they haven 't learned that in monterey .
here you see it on a small scale -- the mothership has landed , r2-d2 and c-3po have stepped out to test the bark mulch to see if they can inhabit this planet .
we know that heather , his sister heather , 14 years old , is turning tricks up here to support her drug habit .
we 're going to have to -- we have a railroad system that the bulgarians would be ashamed of !

as wael ghonim , the google-egyptian-executive by day , secret-facebook-activist by night , famously said to cnn after mubarak stepped down , " if you want to liberate a society , just give them the internet . "
this is a map of social networks worldwide , and certainly facebook has conquered much of the world -- which is either a good or a bad thing , depending on how you like the way facebook manages its service .
because i think all of you will agree that the only legitimate purpose of government is to serve citizens , and i would argue that the only legitimate purpose of technology is to improve our lives , not to manipulate or enslave us .
but it 's going to require innovation that 's not only going to need to focus on politics , on geopolitics , but it 's also going to need to deal with questions of business management , investor behavior , consumer choice and even software design and engineering .
okay , so let 's put in some numbers .
so , that 's the u.k. , and the population density of the u.k.
those are lines of equal power consumption per unit area , which i measure in watts per square meter .
and i 'm not saying that 's a bad idea .
what can a country like the u.k. do on the supply side ?
next , there 's the heating lever .
so we need a plan that adds up , and i 've described for you six big levers , and we need big action because we get 90 percent of our energy from fossil fuels , and so you need to push hard on most if not all of these levers .
it 's still with us today .
and you have people who guide those computers to do their clerical jobs .
and i said , " yeah , it 's , i don 't know . "
on your right is an eight-year-old .
i made a hypothesis , a ridiculous hypothesis .
so a little girl who you see just now , she raised her hand , and she says to me in broken tamil and english , she said , " well , apart from the fact that improper replication of the dna molecule causes disease , we haven 't understood anything else . "
neurons ... communication .
the reptilian part of our brain , which sits in the center of our brain , when it 's threatened , it shuts down everything else , it shuts down the prefrontal cortex , the parts which learn , it shuts all of that down .
she does it with only one age-old gesture .
it 's been tried all over the world , and teachers sort of stand back and say , " it just happens by itself ? "
this one is about what happens to the air we breathe .
if you would please , please do it across all five continents and send me the data , then i 'll put it all together , move it into the school of clouds , and create the future of learning .
yeah , i think that 's pretty likely -- there 's going to be lots of robots everywhere .
we 're going to give this away i think , chris said , after the talk .
okay , so it 's doing local navigation there .
there 's a sea change happening in how -- where technology 's going .
now see if you can put it back together .
rb : yeah , it was really bad , but -- remember , especially when haley joel osment , the little robot , looked at the blue fairy for 2,000 years without taking his eyes off it ?
rb : it smiles . she imitates the smile . this happens a lot .
and he brings the watch center , into the robot 's field of vision , points to it , gives it a motion cue , and the robot looks at the watch quite successfully .
and it 's moving forward , you know , propelled by various charges , and then the soul steps in and tweaks those molecules so that they connect .
before that has to come to be a mildly bad robot , and before that a not so bad robot .
and he reached the point where he felt that there must be something out there that was smaller than the smallest forms of life that were ever known -- bacteria , at the time .
we know it 's not anything that we 've seen before ; it 's sort of the equivalent of an uncharted continent right within our own genetic information .
it 's a rare condition .
i 'm an extreme example of this .
and this is an opening phrase from the novel " lolita . "
easy when you know how .
they yield to the slightest movement or motion or emotion .
well , here 's an example from my own experience .
there are lots of people who believe that , and i think it is utter baloney .
and in a lot of familiar cases , they of course are .
here 's an example of this similarity .
then you use the symmetry of special relativity and you get an even simpler set down here , showing that symmetry exhibits better and better .
symmetry exhibits the simplicity .
i say here that newton did a lot of things that year : gravity , the laws of motion , the calculus , white light composed of all the colors of the rainbow .
it was made of glass , and this building really helped me to do my job good .
so i went out , collected the duck , and before i put it in the freezer , i checked if the victim was indeed of the male sex .
and there are nine other winners who get prizes .
these are cane toads in australia .
so what this bird does is fight his own image .
you press start , nobody touches anything , and it can reach its destination fully autonomously .
so it measures acceleration , angular acceleration -- like a human ear , inner ear .
so these two devices , drivegrip and speedstrip , are very effective .
there 's the grandstand now .
how are we going to handle insurance ?
now , the academics in this audience may think , " well , that sounds like plagiarism . "
now , those of you who are familiar with the logic behind copyright protection -- which is that without ownership , there is no incentive to innovate -- might be really surprised by both the critical success of the fashion industry and the economic success of this industry .
the courts have said over and over again , " you don 't need any more intellectual property protection . "
they don 't want to be wearing what everybody else is wearing .
i don 't know if you know that jokes also can 't be copyright protected .
if you look at the registry , actually , a lot of the registered things in the e.u.
it 's really hard to get copyright for databases .
this is a difficult , unstable binary .
our society loves to romanticize the idea of the single , solo inventor who , working late in the lab one night , makes an earthshaking discovery , and voila , overnight everything 's changed .
when we are in medical school , we learn our anatomy from illustrations such as this where everything 's color-coded .
please go cut that piece out . "
so here in this situation , if you make a solution full of this three-part molecule along with the dye , which is shown in green , and you inject it into the vein of someone who has cancer , normal tissue can 't cut it .
and this works for metastatic lymph nodes also .
i won 't go into this very much , but our technology , besides being able to tag tumor and metastatic lymph nodes with fluorescence , we can also use the same smart three-part molecule to tag gadolinium onto the system so you can do this noninvasively .
but i went ahead anyway .
now you do .
it is not an event for the solo runner .
now why was i so grateful to ted ?
religious teaching , this is where we 've gone so wrong , concentrating solely on believing abstruse doctrines .
and of course the problems sometimes seem insuperable .
and i met julius the last week that i was living in kibera .
this was southland , a small shanty community on the western side of nairobi , kenya .
" for armstrong , southland wasn 't constrained by its material conditions .
people dry out or air out their mattress stuffing on their roofs .
this is a shopping street in kibera , and you can see that there 's a soda dealer , a health clinic , two beauty salons , a bar , two grocery stores , and a church , and more .
and i say that because the system in turkey is notable .
the issue is not the larger , over-arching thing .
and this shows that engineers , medical people , scientific people , have an obsession with solving the problems of reality , when actually most problems , once you reach a basic level of wealth in society , most problems are actually problems of perception .
they are absolutely disgusting and they 're good for nothing . "
for those of you who don 't speak spanish , jugo de naranja -- it 's actually the spanish for " orange juice . "
it said that your family had made a great sacrifice in the past .
and on your right you have a dependent public which is pathetically grateful for anything you give it .
he believes the mobile phone , by being location-specific , contextual , timely and immediate , is simply the greatest persuasive technology device ever invented .
same 100 percent whole-grain wheat in a delicious diamond shape .
so , eventually , the manufacturers actually arrived at a compromise , which was the combo pack .
now as cool as that sounds , my family was not that thrilled with this .
it was on jonestown .
god is going to fix all the problems in the world .
i had no idea that at that moment my life was going to change forever .
i was blind , i couldn 't speak , and i couldn 't walk .
the one advantage that they had over most of you is wisdom , because they had a long life .
so out went the green scrubs and in came the polyester and floral prints .
now imagine you have to cross a street .
and i go , " i 'm just going to touch it . "
my name is abdul khan . i come from peshawar .
and the rising tide of india 's spectacular economic growth has lifted over 400 million indians into a buoyant middle class .
i said somebody here must surely know , because despite the fact that there aren 't that many hungarians to begin with , and the further fact that , so far as i know , there 's not a drop of hungarian blood in my veins , at every critical juncture of my life there has been a hungarian friend or mentor there beside me .
he went to the commercial business high school as a young man in budapest , and there he was as smart as he was modest and he enjoyed a considerable success . and after graduation when he went into textile engineering , the success continued .
probably , mr. teszler had gotten some money into swiss bank accounts because he managed to take his family first to great britain , then to long island and then to the center of the textile industry in the american south .
" no , i reckon i don 't . "
and just as clearly , it is saying , " it 's okay . it was all so beautiful .
and afterwards we convened at the president 's house with dr. robicsek on one hand , mr. milliken on the other .
" ez a mi munkank ; es nem is keves . yo napot , pacak ! "
this is not accurate , but it did happen to tony blair at the davos forum in 2005 , when his doodles were , of course , " discovered " and he was labeled the following things .
that is a pretty solid contribution for a behavior equated with doing nothing .
" oh , it 's very easy . it 's the western world and it 's the developing world , " they say .
then the developing countries applied soap and water , vaccination .
by the way , i 'm teaching you how to use our website , gapminder world , while i 'm correcting this , because this is a free utility on the net .
because in fact , this is child labor . my son and his wife sat in a closet for many years and developed this .
we could actually go to mayflower to eisenhower , and that would be put together into a developing world , which is rightly growing its cities in a very amazing way , which have great entrepreneurs , but also have the collapsing countries .
we have all this at the same time .
and then it 's united states today , up here .
and what has happened in the world ?
i run sweden the same 16 year period .
we never thought it would happen that they would win over sweden !
but now it 's not falling , because there , with help from pepfar , it 's working with treatment . and people are not dying .
this is the epidemic in mozambique . this is an epidemic in northern tanzania .
ghana felt safe to me as a child .
and i had become ashamed of the other , the african in me .
he said that his vote was in his heart .
after all , they decide , and they did .
now i have learned that my place is not just in the west or in africa , and i 'm still searching for my identity , but i saw ghana create democracy better .
and as a reaction , it stimulates public opinion and gives impetus to public debate , thereby preventing the interested parties from totally controlling the agenda , much as they would like to .
i 've been covering the palestinian-israeli conflict since 1981 .
in somalia , the central government collapsed and clan warfare broke out .
perhaps because a lesson had been learned by the weak response to the war in bosnia and the failure in rwanda , when serbia attacked kosovo , international action was taken much more decisively .
when the story was published , unsolicited donations poured in .
in the fall of 2004 i went to darfur .
when war with iraq was imminent , i realized the american troops would be very well covered , so i decided to cover the invasion from inside baghdad .
thank you very much .
thank you .
youtube has really changed the way , or changed the speed , in which a single individual can actually spread an idea around the world .
we 're all familiar with the macro impact of urbanization , climate change , resource exploitation , but when that one last plant — or animal for that matter — when that very last specimen has disappeared from the face of this earth , we would have lost an entire subset of the earth 's biology , and with it , important plants with medicinal potential or which could have ingredients that would speak to the cosmetic , nutrition , pharma , and even the ethno-veterinary sectors , be gone forever .
now , the local people again use the leaves in traditional medicine against respiratory problems .
and this is one of the reasons why the nutrition companies of this world , they are looking for this fruit to provide what we know as reinforced food .
every time a forest is cut down , every time a marsh is filled in , it is a potential lab that goes with it , and which we will never , ever recover .
you were tired , but you felt you could drive a few more miles .
in the past , i 've been a race car owner , a crew chief and a driving coach , although maybe not at the level that you 're currently expecting .
we decided to instrument not only the car , but also the race car driver , to try to get a glimpse into what was going on in their head as they were doing this .
and then he has to turn left .
can we take this reflexive action that we see from the very best race car drivers , introduce it to our cars , and maybe even into a system that could get onto your car in the future ?
now , i can 't do the accent , but i am serious , thanks to these two children , who , as you 'll learn , are very much at the heart of my talk .
in the context of this auditorium , the front two rows aren 't going to get any food .
it 's still sort of locked away in the banking system today .
so following that conversation with my daughter , and seeing the absence of inflation in the face of money-printing , and knowing that international aid payments were falling at just the wrong time , this made me wonder : could we match but just on a much grander scale ?
there was no inflation .
i seriously believe the question should be , why not ?
in the laboratory what we want to do is much the same , but with on the order of tens of different types of molecules -- so a drastic reduction in complexity , but still trying to produce something that looks lifelike .
it forms a surface that is , say , chemically active .
so i add some food source to the system .
there 's a protocell ab now in this system .
these are also , these tar-fueled protocells , are also able to locate resources in their environment .
but these protocells satisfy these general requirements of living systems .
" great -- got it . "
now you think you know what 's coming , michael -- you don 't , ok ?
let 's do something that doesn 't make the lamb squeal and bleed -- we 're on in five continents , dude .
i go in , tail comes off .
ok , i 'm still in " poetics , " in aristotle , and i 'm thinking -- out of nowhere , two terms come crashing into my head that i haven 't heard since my classics professor in college drilled them there .
and , as i stood there , looking at the happy lamb that i had just defiled -- but it looked ok .
roadkill picker-uppers whistle while they work . i swear to god -- i did it with them .
now , he 's selling them to walmart .
but in that moment , what he said next can 't be repeated in the lower 48 .
that 's what plumbers look like , right ?
they look like the stuff we walk around with .
i 've been watching , since i grew up , the expressions of truth and beauty in the arts and truth and beauty in the sciences .
they power how a cell replicates . they power our hearts .
so no matter how lazy you feel , you 're not really intrinsically doing nothing .
it 's called " abegg variations , " by robert schumann , a german 19th century composer .
and once i realized it , there 's a parallel between creating music and creating art , because for your motive or your little initial idea for your drawing , it 's your character -- you want to decide who do you want to draw , or if you want to draw an original character .
oh , d and f -- too familiar .
it also provides a third of the food we eat .
if you do nothing else but to cultivate that response to the great gift that this unique day is , if you learn to respond as if it were the first day in your life and the very last day , then you will have spent this day very well .
thank you .
now , who remembers heisenberg 's uncertainty principle ?
so if we take an example -- ptolemy had dozens of data points to support his theory that the planets would rotate around the earth .
it 's out of your control .
and finally , there 's a profound social impact .
you squeeze your hand , these muscles contract .
you touch yourself , there 's a stimulus that comes up those very same nerves back up to your brain .
he 's just a saint of a man -- 54-year-old lineman who touched the wrong wire and had both of his arms burnt so badly they had to be amputated at the shoulder .
so here 's jesse in our first little test with him .
all right .
i was able to use my elbow and my hand simultaneously .
and then we used some algorithms that are a lot like speech recognition algorithms , called pattern recognition .
so if it stopped working , i just had to take it off .
ak : can 't clap with this one .
we want to build a better arm .
little kids , especially , are attracted by colorful packaging and plastic toys .
when it rains , these chemicals seep into the ground , or run off into our waterways , poisoning our water too .
i want you to know that there are farmers ' markets in every community popping up .
the basic idea of humanism is the improvable quality of life ; that we can do good things , that there are things worth doing because they 're good things to do , and that clear-eyed empiricism can help us figure out how to do them .
" what 's it going to be like to be in high school or junior high school ?
girl 2 : divorced -- parents divorced , maybe .
she asked me to make sure you knew about it .
and a sense of the choices that are available in their lives .
when i asked people their associations with the wheelchair , they used words like " limitation , " " fear , " " pity " and " restriction . "
and i think that moment of completely new thought perhaps creates a freedom that spreads to the rest of other people 's lives .
by the way , since i 've been speaking , another 13,000 people around the world are suffering now with diarrhea .
so that 's definitely going to get through those 200 nanometer holes .
and i 've got a gift here from a friend of mine 's rabbit .
michael pritchard : okay .
so here is the " thinking different " bit .
one day a one-eyed monkey came into the forest .
" the god indra has sinned , in that he has sinned against ... a brahmin .
now , if i were to go into the same crowd and say , " i want to lecture you about justice and injustice , " they would say , " thank you very much , we have other things to do . "
and then aboriginal women in africa would come and say , " this is it ! "
and here is one of the ways we get it to people .
here , father , your eight-times folded cotton sari .
want to kill that cyclist on the way to work , and string up your cousin ' cause she 's such a jerk . oh , dear .
and of course , " the vagina monologues " we know about .
her mother the queen said , " who will marry a whistling princess ? "
thank you .
it was , what i would say , compositional complexity , and i felt that if i had to fulfill what i talked about -- a building for science -- there had to be some kind of a generating idea , some kind of a generating geometry .
you walk through the space , a voice reads the names , ages and place of birth of the children .
and my proposal was to split the museum into two -- the permanent exhibits at one end , the auditorium , library , and changing exhibitions on the other -- to flood the valley into a series of water gardens and to link it all to the fort and to the downtown .
and there are chambers carved in the rock -- concrete walls , stone , the natural rock when possible -- with the light shafts .
and i know it is not a fashionable term these days , and certainly not fashionable in the discourse of architectural schools , but it seems to me that all this , in one way or the other , is a search for beauty .
but this is no news , right ?
yeah .
they are shaping the way we consume .
this got me thinking .
people fear them -- they help the rebellion a lot .
i mean , they didn 't agree with each other -- that was not the point .
today , tech companies are the world 's largest editors .
so let 's start with the first one : christmas island , over 5,000 people .
then the plankton feeders , these little damselfish , the little animals floating in the water .
and the fish have grazed the algae , so the turf of algae is a little lower .
so let me just give you a summary of what no-take reserves do .
so there is spill over ; there are benefits beyond the boundaries of these reserves that help people around them , while at the same time the reserve is protecting the entire habitat . it is building resilience .
now , if you do an economic analysis and project what would happen if the fish were not cut , if we brought just 20 divers one month per year , the revenue would be more than 20 times higher and that would be sustainable over time .
but what about the rest of the coast of the world , where people live and make a living out of fishing ?
that was a masterful job of pulling things together .
you 're saying we 're spending 35 billion dollars now on subsidies .
it was run by the great and powerful parents , and the people were helpless and hopeless naughty children .
well , that 's not exactly the story , because the problem was that parliament delayed and delayed releasing that data , and then they tried to retrospectively change the law so that it would no longer apply to them .
that 's why we 're starting to see more disclosure laws come out , so for example , on the environment , there 's the aarhus convention , which is a european directive that gives people a very strong right to know , so if your water company is dumping water into your river , sewage water into your river , you have a right to know about it .
in my own field of investigative journalism , we 're also having to start thinking globally , so this is a site called investigative dashboard . and if you 're trying to track a dictator 's assets , for example , hosni mubarak , you know , he 's just funneling out cash from his country when he knows he 's in trouble , and what you want to do to investigate that is , you need to have access to all of the world 's , as many as you can , companies ' house registrations databases .
that did end up with vulnerable people in afghanistan being exposed . it also meant that the belarussian dictator was given a handy list of all the pro-democracy campaigners in that country who had spoken to the u.s. government .
you have to trust me . take it on faith . "
but on the other side , if you look at the natural systems , we have proteins that have two million types , can fold in 10,000 nanoseconds , or dna with three billion base pairs we can replicate in roughly an hour .
so these are the brilliant scientists , engineers , designers that worked on this project .
in this case i call it self-guided replication , because your structure contains the exact blueprints .
that 's amazing parallel and distributed computing power , new design possibilities .
it 's a condition , or it 's a situation that leads to mortality .
but what really drives these numbers , this high morbidity , and to some extent the high mortality , is the fact that these start very early in life .
it 's actually a kind of cruel trick of evolution that we simply don 't have a brain that seems to be wired well enough to understand itself .
but most important , go back to where we started .
and i think it 's worth remembering what we 've heard through the conference right from the first day , where i heard that all the important statistics have been given -- about where we are now , about how the continent is doing much better .
because we are confronted with a challenge .
so let 's not forget that it 's taken a lot to build this , including all those things that we tried to do in nigeria that dele referred to .
so when they try to give back , we shouldn 't be on the defensive .
my father was not there .
she gave a shot of her chloroquine -- what i learned was the chloroquine then -- gave her some -- it must have been a re-hydration -- and some other therapies , and put us in a corner .
that 's why i said the debate has to get more sophisticated .
and one day , these foundations have so much money , they will overtake the official aid that is being given .
this is what gives us the hopeless image .
that agriculture will work better if there are railroads to get the goods to market .
let 's see how aid can be a facilitator in partnership .
she needs another 20 million .
now why do i show a cauliflower , a very ordinary and ancient vegetable ?
to the right , i took a higher roughness .
now a lung is something very strange .
well , 99.9 .
and the objects which were used as examples , when i was a child and a student , as examples of the break between mathematics and visible reality -- those objects , i turned them completely around .
i see ; it 's an island . "
now compare that with real price increments .
and after the war , i saw an uncle again .
all that from this little formula , which has whatever , five symbols in it .
it 's brown to start with .
and you see , the choices that we make as an individual , but the choices that we make in every single job that we have , no matter how high or low you are in the pecking order , has an impact on all of these systems .
it 's got no oxygen . it 's tightly compacted and hot .
it 's insane . it 's 1.3 billion tons of food per annum .
the life cycle impact of that lettuce is astronomical .
because obviously energy 's a problem with this product .
1.5 million kettles , seriously problematic .
these are communities , and this is happening all over the world .
so breaking things back down and delivering smartly , elegantly , sophisticated solutions that take into consideration the entire system and the entire life of the thing , everything , all the way back to the extraction through to the end of life , we can start to actually find really innovative solutions .
okay . now , while the table comes up to pressure , let me note here that the sound is not traveling in perfect lines . it 's actually traveling in all directions , and the rubens ' tube 's a little like bisecting those waves with a line , and the flame table 's a little like bisecting those waves with a plane , and it can show a little more subtle complexity , which is why i like to use it to watch geoff farina play guitar .
now , in this series he 's speaking with the aid of a computer , which actually makes identifying the ends of sentences fairly easy . so i wrote a steering algorithm .
there 's still going to be no audio , but what i am going to do is i 'm going to render the sound visually in real time at the bottom of the screen .
in 1990 , in east asia and the pacific region , there were 500 million people living in poverty -- that number now is under 200 million .
they think they 're going to continue to develop a problem or address a problem using today 's tools , at today 's pace of progress , and fail to take into consideration this exponential growth .
it 's an inherent nature of an evolutionary process .
every time one paradigm ran out of steam , another paradigm came out of left field to continue the exponential growth .
unlike gertrude stein 's roses , it 's not the case that a transistor is a transistor .
one little software program , called the fat insulin receptor gene , basically says , " hold onto every calorie , because the next hunting season may not work out so well . "
miniaturization -- we 're shrinking the size of technology at an exponential rate , both wired and wireless .
it will intersect human intelligence in terms of capacity in the 2020s , but that 'll be the hardware side of the equation .
by 2010 computers will disappear .
human life expectancy is expanding . it was 37 in 1800 , and with this sort of biotechnology , nano-technology revolutions , this will move up very rapidly in the years ahead .
so what i did was i quickly put together a collage of all the teachers i had drawn , glorified my school principal , put him right on top , and gifted it to him .
but , most importantly , while i was traveling , i taught children cartooning , and in exchange , i learned how to be spontaneous .
salman rushdie was pissed-off i think because i altered the map of new york , if you notice .
so , i wanted to be a painter like him , except , i don 't know how to paint .
and then i was fortunate enough to actually perform this in california with velocity circus .
so , one day i had the opportunity to meet one of these guys , and i said , " how do you paint like that ? who taught you ? "
no , they were really big geeks , and they didn 't know much about art .
but all this excitement led to the press writing about us .
my works also turned autobiographical .
that 's my little son .
i was 17 .
these are actually solutions . and what do i mean by that ?
they send him to iraq .
he takes the uniform off . he 's no longer sergeant jones in his community . he 's now dave from kansas city .
i broke my right arm . i broke my collarbone .
the next concern was whether i would walk again , because i was paralyzed from the waist down .
if i couldn 't do that , then what could i do ?
i soaked it up and i thought , how could i ever have taken this for granted ?
and the question i asked was , " why me ? why me ? "
and that realization was about to change my life .
they sat me down . there are buttons and dials everywhere .
and then i made great progression to the point where i could walk around the house , holding onto the walls , like this , and mom said she was forever following me , wiping off my fingerprints .
i now know that my real strength never came from my body , and although my physical capabilities have changed dramatically , who i am is unchanged .
we did this software which displays it like this : every bubble here is a country .
your yellow ones here are the arabic countries , and they get larger families , but they -- no , longer life , but not larger families .
and this is latin america . it has everything on this earth , from the poorest to the richest , in latin america .
yemen , civil war . united arab emirate , money which was quite equally and well used .
in spite of falling oil prices , he brought this country up here .
a search function where we can copy the data up to a searchable format and get it out in the world . and what do we hear when we go around ?
it takes some time to change for this , but on the axises , you can quite easily get any variable you would like to have .
well , ladies and gentlemen , we live at one of those times .
and if it is therefore the case , as i believe it is , that one of the phenomenon of our time is the globalization of power , then it follows that one of the challenges of our time is to bring governance to the global space .
you might argue that the story , the history of civilizations , has been civilizations gathered around seas -- with the first ones around the mediterranean , the more recent ones in the ascendents of western power around the atlantic .
if paris got together with berlin , britain got together with vienna and rome to provide a counterbalance .
people say to me , " the chinese , of course , they 'll never get themselves involved in peace-making , multilateral peace-making around the world . "
there are fires in the steppes of russia , food riots in africa .
but now one final thing .
as other speakers have said , it 's a rather daunting experience -- a particularly daunting experience -- to be speaking in front of this audience .
we 're not top on people 's lists for dinner party guests and conversations and so on .
and for some reason -- which shall remain rather vague -- we 're interested in a particular pattern .
so you 've all got to think about this , and you 've all got to vote -- and we 're not moving on .
so imagine -- let 's suppose we 're doing it .
what 's the point i want to make ?
well , there are lots of reasons .
don 't think you don 't trust me anymore .
each of those explanations has a likely bit and an unlikely bit .
so if you toss a coin twice , the chance of getting a head twice are a half -- that 's the chance the first time -- times a half -- the chance a second time .
it 's exactly the same in this context .
so just to conclude -- what are the take-home messages from this ?
usually -- one hopes -- innocently , but misrepresented evidence .
they 're people getting out of poverty as fast as they can .
for the last 50 years , we have focused on treating the individual gene in understanding cancer , not in controlling cancer .
i co-founded a company called navigenics , where , if you spit into a tube -- and we can look look at 35 or 40 genetic markers for disease , all of which are delayable in many of the cancers -- you start to identify what you could get , and then we can start to work to prevent them .
so , it is the idea of sequencing all of the genes in the cancer , and giving us a new lexicon , a new dictionary to describe it .
if you could start to move that , to identify what you 're up against , you 're going to do things a hell of a lot better .
and , believe it or not , there were hisses in the audience .
and so , if you think of cancer as a system , there 's an input and an output and a state in the middle .
nobody has ever shown -- and this will be shocking -- nobody has ever shown that most chemotherapy actually touches a cancer cell .
so the diseases we have today , which reflect patterns in the system over the last several decades , are going to change dramatically over the next decade or so based on things like this .
so , it was done on this group of patients .
but if one is unfortunate to get a disease , you 'll go into your doctor 's office , he or she will take a drop of blood , and we will start to know how to treat your disease .
we need to start to think differently and radically .
to what extent do we self-construct , do we self-invent ?
and you know what that means , of course .
it 's such an eye-opening experience to be here .
anyway .
but then on top of that , you know , sarah jones told me we only have 18 minutes .
right now it 's very exciting actually for me because i 'm the junior assistant to the associate director under the senior vice president for business development -- that 's my new title .
and we were only 11 years old , so it was not appropriate .
uh , well , thank you .
she only wants to spend time with her friends .
and i would like to first of all thank sarah jones for putting all of the pressure on the only arab who she brought with her to be last today .
and i pray that this is the way that we will self-invent , in time .
so i wrote a letter .
more than three and a half thousand photos go up onto facebook .
and finding the source becomes more and more important -- finding the good source -- and twitter is where most journalists now go .
oh , shit !
this is from hama .
so we go a bit further . we switch to the satellite view , and we find another bridge , and everything starts to line up .
thanks very much .
the self was not constant .
i was a noticeable nobody .
so in africa , there 's been more time to create genetic diversity . "
for a start , we can think about all the times when we do lose ourselves .
and over time and with practice , i 've tried to live more and more from my essence .
but nothing else does either .
never mind that i had no idea what ginger beer was .
the only thing my mother told us about him was that his family was very poor .
but in the u.s. whenever africa came up people turned to me .
but i must quickly add that i too am just as guilty in the question of the single story .
i told him that i had just read a novel called american psycho -- -- and that it was such a shame that young americans were serial murderers .
i 've always felt that it is impossible to engage properly with a place or a person without engaging with all of the stories of that place and that person .
what if my roommate knew about the female lawyer who recently went to court in nigeria to challenge a ridiculous law that required women to get their husband 's consent before renewing their passports ?
and i could see everybody looked at me , somebody said , " bollywood . "
you 're a director , you 've done it for years . "
and i say , " cate , what do you want to do ? "
and i would think , " daddy , how far does the universe go ? "
we are the stories we tell ourselves .
and i said , " why ? " he said , " because nobody is going to give you a film if you talk about subtext .
they said , " we won the armada . "
are you with child ?
you no longer have the queen 's protection .
so how do i start all this ?
there 's a mythology in india about -- where they say , and i 'll say it in hindi , [ hindi ] right . what does that mean ?
it 's the effect of looking for harmony in the contradiction that exists in a poet 's mind , a contradiction that exists in a storyteller 's mind .
so let me start with genomics .
but most things , you really have to know what 's going on in the kitchen , because , mostly , sick people used to be healthy people -- they have the same genome .
there 's a huge amount of information about the genetics just by comparing the genetic similarity .
i kept getting this call from this oncologist named david agus .
they really tell us what 's going on there .
so this already , i think , is tremendously useful in all kinds of medicine .
well , right now what we do is we divide it by part of the body -- you know , where did it appear ? -- and we put you in different categories according to the part of the body .
so your house is dealing with leaks all the time , but it 's fixing them . it 's draining them out and so on .
and so i believe that this will be the way that cancer will be treated in the future .
and when i went to find out something , i used scientific methods . i wasn 't real surprised , you know , when they first told me how -- how you were supposed to do science , because i 'd already been doing it for fun and whatever .
one thing , he put a bird in there , and he pumped all the air out , and the bird died . so he said , hmm ...
it 's two fans , one which he could turn from outside after he got the vacuum established , and he discovered that if he pulled all the air out of it , the one fan would no longer turn the other one , right ?
and seeing what happens , it was ok to generalize , and say , i 'm sure that this will happen anytime we make one of these things .
remember , that 's a short time .
i didn 't take it personally , but -- i just -- i had -- i naively had thought , until this surfing experience started me into the 17th century , i 'd thought that 's just the way people thought , and everybody did , and they recognized reality by what they could see or touch or feel or hear .
i 'm sure it 's got to do with rockets or it wouldn 't be in that manual .
and we had not -- i mean , we weren 't frightened by it .
and no tricky shit behind the thing . i mean , it 's all -- you 've got to be very honest with what you 're doing if it really is going to work .
but a lot of people got in it for the money and the power and the travel .
but in fact , it was just coming up -- it was the nighttime ; the daytime temperatures didn 't go up .
they 're concerned , and you can tell they have very guarded conclusions in these papers , because they 're talking about big laboratories that are funded by lots of money and by scared people .
now , on the other side of the network , you tend to have primarily african-american and latino folks who are really concerned about somewhat different things than the geeks are , but just to give some sense , the green part of the network we call smalltimore , for those of us that inhabit it , because it seems as though we 're living in a very small town .
other boy bands , country singers , gospel music , funk and rap and stand-up comedy , and there 's even a whole section around drugs and jokes .
others battle oppressive societies .
i was faced with an organized defamation campaign in the local media combined with false rumors shared in family gatherings , in the streets and in schools .
and to my surprise , it got hundreds of thousands of views the first day .
there was this official study that was presented to the shura council -- it 's the consultative council appointed by the king in saudi arabia — and it was done by a local professor , a university professor .
i know .
i learned to be always there .
and i don 't know how i became one now .
this rebirth of grass . and then i went out for years trying to photograph the pristine landscape .
and these ages of man are still at work today .
what you 're looking at here -- i went to bangladesh , so i started to move away from north america ; i started to look at our world globally .
so this created a reservoir 600 kilometers long , one of the largest reservoirs ever created .
this is wushan , one of the largest cities that was relocated .
this is a shift change , one of three .
in fact , even shenzhen , the economic zone -- one of the first ones -- 15 years ago was about 100,000 people , and today it boasts about 10 to 11 million .
and again , looking at these images , there 's this constant , like , haze that you 're seeing .
the machines are all running , absolutely incredible to see what the scale of industries are .
there 's 21,000 employees . this one factory -- and they had several of them -- is half a kilometer long .
and to me the whole notion -- the things i 'm photographing are out of a great concern about the scale of our progress and what we call progress .
what was unusual , according to stephen , is less than five percent of ads are actually leading with image .
in that way , what 's happening is that we 're motivating a certain age group to start thinking .
we go into the cold war , and we continue to try and build walls .
last year , at this time , there were 20 vessels , 500 mariners held hostage .
this kind of trafficking , in narcotics , in humans , in weapons , god forbid , in weapons of mass destruction , is part of the threat to the global commons .
you would be correct .
they 're all part of this .
why do we want to be involved ?
you don 't have to have a military that is either in hard combat or is in the barracks .
visual effects are based on the principles of all illusions : assumption , things are as we know them ; presumption , things will behave as we expect ; and context in reality , our knowledge of the world as we know it , such as scale .
and so while other kids were bbm-ing their parents , i was literally waiting by the mailbox to get a letter from home to see how the weekend had gone , which was a little frustrating when grandma was in the hospital , but i was just looking for some sort of scribble , some unkempt cursive from my mother .
these are the kinds of stories that convinced me that letter-writing will never again need to flip back her hair and talk about efficiency , because she is an art form now , all the parts of her , the signing , the scripting , the mailing , the doodles in the margins .
nor am i going to talk about what i think are obvious statements from my first book , " silicon snake oil , " or my second book , nor am i going to talk about why i believe computers don 't belong in schools .
what i ask myself is , what 's society is going to be like , when the kids today are phenomenally good at text messaging and spend a huge amount of on-screen time , but have never gone bowling together ?
so it 's highly -- that one 's the cool one .
he wrote a letter of recommendation for me to get into graduate school .
is true . is true . i teach eighth-grade science four days a week .
i was all set to do it and i was thinking , " aw man , " i was just going to impose upon the powers that be , and measure the speed of light .
i 'll put it over here , and as i move this away from the source , you 'll notice the spiral .
there 's a riot ! hey , elmo 's done : off .
the time 's going backwards because i 'm inside of it .
and the mosquito has killed more humans than wars and plague .
now the odd thing is , is that once you 've been bitten by this mosquito , and you 've had this disease , your body develops antibodies , so if you 're bitten again with that strain , it doesn 't affect you .
well , there 's two principle ways .
we don 't want to have a lasting impact on the environment .
so here 's a typical situation , male meets female , lots of offspring .
and we 've got a production unit in oxford , or just south of oxford , where we actually produce these mosquitos .
both have a side benefit , which is that we reduce pesticide use tremendously .
so you 're looking at roughly one percent of the brain of a cockroach .
this experiment revealed the first , and perhaps most fundamental , nugget of the neural code : that information is written in the form of electrical impulses .
because the light-activated pore is encoded in dna , we can achieve incredible precision .
they didn 't get very far , obviously .
so we set out to identify the cells in the fly 's brain that played the role of the critic .
these 12 cells , as shown here in green , send the output to a brain structure called the " mushroom body , " which is shown here in gray .
in the experiments i told you about , we have lifted the identity of the critic , but we still have no idea how the critic does its job .
so i suppose you 're not going to be able to kick me off the stage , since you asked the question .
but , yeah , it was sad at the time , but we moved on .
rb : i should have .
when i first came to america , i used to try this with employees as well and they kind of -- they have these different rules over here , it 's very strange .
rb : yeah , it 'll be ready in -- well , ready in 12 months and then we do 12 months extensive testing .
and , i mean , first of all we -- nobody had actually crossed the atlantic in a hot air balloon before , so we had to build a hot air balloon that was capable of flying in the jet stream , and we weren 't quite sure , when a balloon actually got into the jet stream , whether it would actually survive the 200 , 220 miles an hour winds that you can find up there .
but fortunately , they never had to use it .
and generally , the people would say , oh , well that 's bad news .
do you look at the current generation of kids coming up and think they 're too coddled , they don 't know what they 've got , we 're going to raise a generation of privileged ...
it 's actually a nickname given to priests in the eighteenth century . "
i mean , do you think about life balance ?
we 're trying to -- maybe we 'll change it -- but anyway , it 's a war room to try to coordinate all the attack that 's going on in africa , all the different social problems in africa , and try to look at best practices .
i mean , the psychologist erik erikson says that -- as i understand him and i 'm a total amateur -- but that during 30s , 40s people are driven by this desire to grow and that 's where they get their fulfillment .
that 's a thing . google it .
everything we blog , everything we tweet , and everything we click is a public act of making media .
i mean , really , same example : if you don 't like politicians calling each other names , stop clicking on the stories about what one guy in one party called the other guy in the other party .
for example , flipping a boring lecture from the classroom to the screen of a mobile device might save instructional time , but if it is the focus of our students ' experience , it 's the same dehumanizing chatter just wrapped up in fancy clothing .
can we be the surgeons of our classrooms ?
about the size of the great wall of china , this would hardly be an invisible structure .
some are already deserts ; others are being seriously degraded by the sand .
they had to move this village in 1987 as a huge dune threatened to swallow it .
we can start harvesting condensation , and start greening the desert from within .
well , i 'll quickly show you two options .
the world is likely to lose one third of its arable land by the end of the century .
so how could i untangle this knotted bunch of sentences ?
she would just take her fruit , her mom packed her a melon every day , and she would just throw it in the ivy and then she would eat fruit snacks and pudding cups , and i was like , " riley , you can 't do that , you have to eat the fruit . "
we know these characters aren 't real , and yet we also know that they are .
it 's a secret door that you can walk through .
leeches , nature 's tiny doctors .
i want a book to be a secret door that opens and lets the stories out into reality .
and they get a picture of their whale too .
i would want anyone i was writing for to be in that place emotionally with the things that i create .
well , it started back in the late 1800s when people started settling in places like montana .
they 're concerned about securing an adequate supply of water , they 're trying to be really efficient with their water use , and they 're concerned about how their water use affects the image of their brand .
so , working with local water trusts , we created an incentive to do so .
we 've connected senior water rights holders with brewers in montana , with hotels and tea companies in oregon and with high-tech companies that use a lot of water in the southwest .
so as camping trips go , it was a long one , and one i 've seen summarized most succinctly here on the hallowed pages of business insider malaysia .
and of course some strange and predictable combination of curiosity , stubbornness , and probably hubris led me to thinking i might be the man to try to finish the job .
we traveled up and down one of the largest and most dangerous glaciers in the world , the beardmore glacier .
we had a finite amount of food in the sledges to make this journey , so we were trying to string that out by reducing our intake to half the calories we should have been eating .
this was the biggest dream i 've ever had , and it was so nearly perfect .
i 've got one on my nose , one on each cheek , from where the goggles are , but inside i am a very different person indeed .
you know , it 's very old . this is a plate from 1797 .
and i want to tell you how we did that in origami .
or you can ramp up and go up to 50 stars on a flag , with 13 stripes .
and i 'm going to show you all how to do that so you can go out of here and fold something .
so now we 're ready to scale up .
or you could do a moose .
and sometimes you create high art , and sometimes you pay the bills by doing some commercial work .
so , imagine a lens the size of a football field .
and this example is the latter .
and i 'd like to do a little collateral thinking , if you will , about compassion and bring it from the global level to the personal .
and this difference between the self and the other focus can be very subtle .
this is a man who terrorized the very vicinity we 're in many years ago . he was known as the santa cruz strangler .
in a sense , the room itself is the elephant in the room , but we don 't see it . and we 've become victims of a system that points us elsewhere . consider this .
the moment i stopped , half a dozen other people immediately ringed the same guy .
it consumes about 15 watts of power .
so the smaller you make r , the more dramatically the inertia reduces .
this is a picture of a recent experiment we did -- actually not so recent anymore -- in sendai shortly after the earthquake .
and the obstacles can be moving .
so this is the kind of coordination we want our robots to have .
so this just shows that we can double , triple , quadruple the robot strength by just getting them to team with neighbors , as you can see here .
it builds the map .
the first thing i want to do is say thank you to all of you .
more and more rules to protect us against an indifferent , uncaring set of institutions we have to deal with .
we need people who want to do the right thing .
a wise person knows when to improvise .
he had never committed a crime before .
so that is an example , both of wisdom in practice and the subversion of wisdom by rules that are meant , of course , to make things better .
it creates people -- when you manipulate incentives to get people to do the right thing -- it creates people who are addicted to incentives .
these are people who are looking not to dodge the system 's rules and regulations , but to transform the system , and we talk about several .
stayed with them , followed up on them , made sure that they were sticking to whatever plan had been jointly developed to get them over the hump .
so the patients are not organ systems , and they 're not diseases ; they 're people , people with lives .
in giving us the will and the skill to do the right thing -- to do right by others -- practical wisdom also gives us the will and the skill to do right by ourselves .
the idea goes like this : imagine space is a substrate of all there is .
that raised a question : warps and curves in what ?
it 's in manhattan . you 're in central park -- it 's kind of irrelevant -- but the cable looks one-dimensional from a distant viewpoint , but you and i all know that it does have some thickness .
superstring theory -- what is it ?
the different particles are responsible for all the richness in the world around us .
and the wonderful thing is , if those numbers had any other values than the known ones , the universe , as we know it , wouldn 't exist .
and if we could calculate the allowed vibrational patterns , we should be able to calculate those 20 numbers .
einstein comes along and says , well , space and time can warp and curve -- that 's what gravity is .
i do not recommend this at all .
i decided to take it to its logical conclusion and take everything in the bible literally , without picking and choosing .
so , i wanted to follow that rule .
it happened -- i was in the park , and i was dressed in my biblical clothing , so sandals and sort of a white robe , you know , because again , the outer affects the inner .
because if you do , then you end up acting like a crazy person , and stoning adulterers , or -- here 's another example .
so , this is actually a key to happiness for me , is to just remember when i came over here , the car didn 't flip over , and i didn 't trip coming up the stairs .
and their argument is that jesus never talked about homosexuality .
you have to pick and choose . and anyone who follows the bible is going to be picking and choosing .
but with the rise of interstate trucking , it was used less and less .
we thought it would cost 100 million dollars to build .
and they 're going to break ground in may .
but in the last two decades , it has experienced an unprecedented expansion , now accounting for roughly 15 percent of the world 's gdp .
here are some of those same weightlifters after their 1989 makeover .
the european union , which by now was beginning to reap the benefits of globalization , transforming it into the most affluent consumer market in history , eventually comprising some 500 million people .
so if you can smuggle them into the e.u. , there are very handsome profits to be made , and i want to show you this to demonstrate the type of resources available to these groups .
now these things are an essential part of the money laundering parade , and if you want to do something about illegal tax evasion and transnational organized crime , money laundering , you have to get rid of them .
when that happens , it is a trend which is set to overwhelm our policing capacity in the west .
you would not believe how easy it is to persuade people to do things with their computers which are objectively not in their interest .
there is no romance involved with gangsters in the 21st century .
now , if you parked those end to end and wrapped them around the earth , that would stretch around the earth 125 times .
and that 's quite exciting .
i 'm very , very intrigued by the fact that our cars and trucks sit idle 90 percent of the time : they 're parked , they 're parked all around us .
are you guys going to really try and show leadership on this ?
there was just no future .
and this picture was sent throughout the country .
we introduced our first microcredit program in 1975 , and the women who organized it said , " we only want to lend to women who practice family planning .
i said , " don 't worry . come over and i 'll do the whole lot of you . "
so i said , " okay . "
in taxis , you get condoms .
we had condoms in all the refrigerators in the hotels and the schools , because alcohol impairs judgment .
and before you can borrow the money , you need to be trained .
re-do the school , make it serve the community needs .
scientists have always created pictures as part of their thinking and discovery process .
what would it look like ?
thank you .
when the cell feels it 's ready to go , it rips apart the chromosome .
it is a signal broadcasting system .
discovering this stuff is certainly a pleasurable incentive to work in science .
it is organic , across our religious , spiritual and ethical traditions , and yet it transcends them .
i 'm not sure if i can show you what tolerance looks like , but i can show you what compassion looks like -- because it is visible .
and compassion can also have those qualities .
but here 's a face from 20th century science that might surprise you in a discussion about compassion .
and it is much harder , often , to be compassionate towards those closest to us , which is another quality in the universe of compassion , on its dark side , that also deserves our serious attention and illumination .
now , usually when people hear statistics or stats like that , you start thinking about places like haiti or other kind of exotic or maybe even impoverished areas , but it happens right here in the united states every single year .
in fact , 15 exos can fit on a single semi truck by itself .
so in one year , we 've negotiated manufacturing agreements , been awarded one patent , filed our second patent , talked to multiple people , demoed this to fema and its consultants to rave reviews , and then started talking to some other people who requested information , this little group called the united nations .
i 'm a big believer in the emotion of design , and the message that 's sent before somebody begins to read , before they get the rest of the information ; what is the emotional response they get to the product , to the story , to the painting -- whatever it is .
this is from my second book .
i think you eventually can and , more importantly , i think it 's true .
that was it . that 's all he saw as the options . and not too far off .
they were wild-posted around new york city .
and the umbrella campaign was " thank god it 's monday . "
and i was fortunate to find a photograph of a teacher sitting on some books .
one -- who knows what she 's going through ; the other one is worried about model behavior and milk .
this lady 's advertising for her lost pit bull .
and if you wouldn 't , what the heck are you doing ?
other creatures can enjoy them too .
to answer this question , we need to flip back in the family album to some baby pictures .
it 's her " come hither " sign .
dubbed " femme fatales " by jim lloyd , another colleague , these females have figured out how to target the males of other firefly species .
thank you .
and on the other hand , accordion , the friendly bus , he carries 300 people -- 275 in sweden ; 300 brazilians .
what in the design that made the difference is the boarding tubes : the boarding tube gives to the bus the same performance as a subway .
and coming back to the car , i always used to say that the car is like your mother-in-law : you have to have good relationship with her , but she cannot command your life .
don 't forget : creativity starts when you cut a zero from your budget .
so , i 'll start with this : a couple years ago , an event planner called me because i was going to do a speaking event .
so i 'm a researcher-storyteller , and i 'm going to talk to you today -- we 're talking about expanding perception -- and so i want to talk to you and tell some stories about a piece of my research that fundamentally expanded my perception and really actually changed the way that i live and love and work and parent .
so i thought , you know what , i 'm going to start with connection .
you know this .
in fact , i did it first in a four-day very intensive data analysis , where i went back , pulled these interviews , pulled the stories , pulled the incidents .
this led to a little breakdown -- -- which actually looked more like this .
and i said , " well , i have a vulnerability issue .
why do we struggle with it so much ?
i hack into your lives for a living .
a way to discharge pain and discomfort .
but there 's another way , and i 'll leave you with this .
however , here 's chris ' clock .
jinsop lee : hey , my name 's jinsop , and today , i 'm going to show you what riding motorbikes is like from the point of view of the five senses . hey !
respondents said that great sex hits all of the five senses at an extreme level .
now , i don 't play the flute or the clarinet , so i decided to combine these keys with an instrument i do play : the television remote control .
it 's the raw material , the stuff , of evolution in our agricultural crops .
imagine that . 7,100 apples with names .
it sounds like it was written by an old school teacher of mine .
now , the highest concentration of poor and hungry people in the world , and the place where climate change , ironically , is going to be the worst is in south asia and sub-saharan africa .
unfortunately , these seed banks are located around the world in buildings and they 're vulnerable .
and this next picture shows it in context , in svalbard .
and if anything happens , then they can come back and get it .
and we need to support it financially .
and this ideal product would also be able to go about five kilometers a day so you could get to your job , get to school , and do it on many , many different types of terrain .
so as a wet-behind-the-ears student , excited , our team made a prototype , brought that prototype to tanzania , kenya and vietnam in 2008 , and found it was terrible because we didn 't get enough input from users .
ashok : you also encouraged me to work .
it 's measuring all sorts of things around the car .
so this is a child , about the same age as the racing car on stage , three months old .
and when things start to change , when conditions start to deteriorate , we move into the red line .
as a matter of fact , this is something that about half of you , more than half of you will not be familiar with .
ignore the instructions , that 's what the government has to put in there to confuse you , i 'm sure .
they deceive these people , costs them a lot of money , cost them a lot of emotional anguish .
and they take advantage of the innocent , the naive , the grieving , the needy people out there .
no , it is not fun . it is a cruel farce .
she gives you the names of previous lives , who you were in previous lives .
i 'm alive , you may have noticed .
why don 't they affect me ?
well , with sylvia browne i would think so .
you will see the records that we have .
spiders are not just everywhere , but they 're extremely diverse .
so silk comes out of the spinnerets , and for those of us spider silk biologists , this is what we call the " business end " of the spider .
nearly all of these proteins can be explained by a single gene family , so this means that the diversity of silk types we see today is encoded by one gene family , so presumably the original spider ancestor made one kind of silk , and over the last 380 million years , that one silk gene has duplicated and then diverged , specialized , over and over and over again , to get the large variety of flavors of spider silks that we have today .
specifically , if you look on the vertical axis , that 's stress . if you look at the maximum stress value for each of these fibers , you can see that there 's a lot of variation , and in fact dragline , or major ampullate silk , is the strongest of these fibers .
yet , their draglines are not the toughest .
to borrow from the writings of a spider named charlotte , silk is terrific .
so the problem we introduced to him was this : he 's just moved house .
you can lean back , but the camera will change its perspective depending on which way you 're looking .
we also reference that with the tonation database that we build up of dimitri 's voice , or the user 's voice .
milo : okay .
milo : what do they want to come here for anyway ?
but for me , this is a wonderful opportunity where technology , at last , can be connected with , where i am no longer restrained by the finger i hold in my hand -- as far as a computer game 's concerned -- or by the blandness of not being noticed if you 're watching a film or a book .
they are lucky . they already have a job .
you give the injection and then put it down .
this is the problem : satellites are big , expensive and they 're slow .
now , this is pretty normal for a silicon valley company that we are , but we believe it 's the first time for a space company .
it 's really cool . wait for it .
we 'll be able to see the extent of all water bodies around the whole world every day and help water security .
well , i invite you to come and explore with us .
in order to convert this opaque , 90,000 hours of video into something that we could start to see , we use motion analysis to pull out , as we move through space and through time , what we call space-time worms .
and the [ horizontal ] axis is time .
we 're now on the couch , looking out through the window at cars passing by .
and just for contrast , we can do this with any word .
and what we 're seeing here , these skyscrapers now , are commentary that are linked to content on television .
this is a pro-amateur , or pro-am media critic who has this high fan-out rate .
and i really want you to focus on something as i take you through .
and little did i know that one year later ... we 'd be doing this show . sobule : i sing . sweeney : i tell stories . together : the jill and julia show . sobule : hey , they asked us back ! sweeney : can you stand it ? !
and the basic idea is that there 's this law of attraction , and your thoughts have this vibrating energy that goes out into the universe and then you attract good things to happen to you .
i 'm sure at the time he did that , i didn 't -- it didn 't -- well , somewhere , i guess in the hidden recesses of mind , it popped out years later .
coal oil lamp -- we didn 't have electricity in our farm home .
later on i said certain things -- i had -- players , if we 're leaving for somewhere , had to be neat and clean .
and the third one was , never criticize a teammate .
i think our tendency is to hope that things will turn out the way we want them to much of the time . but we don 't do the things that are necessary to make those things become reality .
just get out there , and whatever you 're doing , do it to the best of your ability .
i was asked one time about that , and they said , " suppose that you in some way could make the perfect player . what would you want ? "
neither one of those youngsters could shoot very well .
in the lower 48 , the farthest you can get away from a maintained road is 20 miles .
and those who really own it are the generations as yet unborn .
these days , i call myself a graphic artist .
and these tiling units , i designed specifically so that they would contain parts of letterforms within their shapes so that i could then join those pieces together to create letters and then words within the abstract patterning .
so it 's a little bit unexpected , but , in a way , it refers to the macaroni art that children make for their parents or they make in school and give to their parents , which is in itself a form of honor .
these are my valentines from 2005 and 2006 .
and i 'm just going to read one of them to you .
and yes , sometimes i 'm swayed by money .
in the words of the poet longfellow , " the human voice is the organ of the soul . "
so i reached out to my collaborator , tim bunnell .
because when we mix them , we can get a voice that 's as clear as our surrogate talker -- that 's the person we borrowed the filter from — and is similar in identity to our target talker .
what 's novel is how we make it sound like this young woman .
and as a scientist , i 'm so excited to take this work out of the laboratory and finally into the real world so it can have real-world impact .
just 10 minutes , undisturbed ?
you get stressed , you do some meditation .
at the same time , this sort of constant mind-wandering is also a direct cause of unhappiness .
you go back to it , repeat it . " oh , i am worried .
nine years ago , i worked for the u.s. government in iraq , helping rebuild the electricity infrastructure .
this is a high-end . this is what we 'd call a " smart knee . "
regardless of your income level , you want the most beautiful , the best product that there is .
how do all these components get to the clinic ?
and this goes into my last point .
and she said , " well , now that i can walk again , i can go back and complete my studies . "
this is the community that i originally showed you the slide of .
if there 's one operation for a disease , you know it works .
" the world will not be saved by the internet . "
what is it that we have every right to ask of ourselves , out of our shared humanity and out of the human spirit ?
remember , i have been talking about , essentially philanthropy : the love of humankind , the individual humankind and the individual humankind that can bring that kind of love translated into action , translated , in some cases , into enlightened self-interest .
why are the leadership gaps widening when there 's so much more investment in leadership development ?
the second question is , what is the diversity measure of your personal and professional stakeholder network ?
thank you .
self-study , self-exploration , self-empowerment : these are the virtues of a great education .
and in short order , thousands of people were building our machine .
and with that in mind , i 'd like to say a few words about traditional college grading .
moving along , what about the area of a triangle ?
and this delta water flows to mobile bay , and finally into the gulf of mexico .
so i went right up to the front of the tank -- i was three or four inches from the front glass -- and the octopus was sitting on a perch , a little rock , and he came off the rock and he also came down right to the front of the glass .
i remember i took a trip to australia , went to an island called one tree island .
so we created a way to find out , and i got my first look at that famous beak in action .
and they 're big mountains , thousands of feet tall , some of which are tens of thousands of feet and bust through the surface , creating islands like hawaii .
it 's amazing to think that this is actually on earth ; it looks like aliens in an alien environment .
so this rainwater is flooding down the hillside , carrying with it sediments from the construction site , smothering the coral and killing it .
look in your own backyard .
so , i hope that we can also keep some of these " hope spots " in the deep sea .
and then , we fast-forward to about 1932 , when three italian psychiatrists , who were largely treating depression , began to notice among their patients , who were also epileptics , that if they had an epileptic -- a series of epileptic fits , a lot of them in a row -- the depression would very frequently lift .
but they wrote a paper about this , and everybody in the western world began using electricity to convulse people who were either schizophrenic or severely depressed .
being someone who had had a very difficult childhood , a very difficult adolescence -- it had to do with not quite poverty but close .
i rarely bathed . i sometimes didn 't shave . it was dreadful .
and he asked to meet with the senior staff , and they agreed to meet with him because he was very well thought of in that place .
i could blow the depression away .
it 's been , as i said , close to 30 years .
to those to whom it doesn 't happen , there will be adversities .
here is one such scrap from an initiative i 'm involved in using creativity to inspire people to be greener .
andy hobsbawm : we 've got the science , we 've had the debate .
but we take the severe ones , and we reschedule the other ones the next day .
we can reconcile .
that 's why i became a doctor .
i succeeded in my place .
i thought i would read poems i have that relate to the subject of youth and age .
in those days , those days which exist for me only as the most elusive memory now , when often the first sound you 'd hear in the morning would be a storm of birdsong , then the soft clop of the hooves of the horse hauling a milk wagon down your block , and the last sound at night as likely as not would be your father pulling up in his car , having worked late again , always late , and going heavily down to the cellar , to the furnace , to shake out the ashes and damp the draft before he came upstairs to fall into bed -- in those long-ago days , women , my mother , my friends ' mothers , our neighbors , all the women i knew -- wore , often much of the day , what were called housedresses , cheap , printed , pulpy , seemingly purposefully shapeless light cotton shifts that you wore over your nightgown and , when you had to go look for a child , hang wash on the line , or run down to the grocery store on the corner , under a coat , the twisted hem of the nightgown always lank and yellowed , dangling beneath .
my seeing her , it wasn 't her , at the mailbox .
her whispering , " thanks love . " lightly , lightly against me .
i was afraid some repressed part of myself would go out of control , and i 'd be forever entrapped in the shocking seethe of her stench .
and the girl remembers , in this infinite instant already now so many times divided , the sadness she felt once , hardly knowing she felt it , to merely inhabit herself .
even that though . another confession : once in a book on pre-war poland , a studio portrait , an absolute angel , an absolute angel with tormented , tormenting eyes .
thank you .
we really showed that , yes , we can .
the temperature 's going to drop two , three degrees centigrade .
you can build nice stations .
all these red parts are favelas .
so the third commandment i want to leave here tonight is , a city of the future has to be socially integrated .
i 've already told the people that we have tropical rain this time of year .
osorio : absolutely , mr. mayor .
a city of the future is a city that can never let anyone out of this great party , which are cities .
how does that work ? "
and it 's also sometimes called algo trading , algorithmic trading . "
so this is one that they found , they called the knife , the carnival , the boston shuffler , twilight .
but what if you could rate those movies before they get made ?
everybody who wants to go to the 10th floor goes into car two , and everybody who wants to go to the third floor goes into car five .
and this is really where the wires come right up into the city .
they 're prophecy for the kind of seismic , terrestrial effects of the math that we 're making .
i 'd seen a lot of death , in particular epidemic death , and epidemic death has a different feel to it .
the other explanation or , in a way , the solution suggested , is please fix all of these things : the schools , the community , the homes , the families , everything .
which also sounds like , if there is a case of flu , someone gave someone a case of flu , or a cold , or the greatest risk factor of tuberculosis is having been exposed to tuberculosis .
and this was a beautiful thing for the neighborhood itself , first 50 or 60 days , then 90 days , and then there was unfortunately another shooting in another 90 days , and the moms were hanging out in the afternoon .
my musician friends added the word " dude . "
i love my food .
oh , some of you have seen it .
because those people who were hunter-gatherers in origin wanted to be free and roam and pick up information as they wanted , and those that were in the business of farming information wanted to build fences around it , create ownership and wealth and structure and settlement .
are we going to start looking at what happens when your information source is turned off , as a famine ?
and the song began to move on i understand like this .
now , what i 'd been trained to do was methodological research on such people .
then we had a four and a half million-dollar line of credit because we were credit-worthy at that point .
there 's just one of them .
but it 's not just about people ; it 's about lifestyles .
all of those things are part of that equation .
they may have a lot of opinions about it , but they 're not going to be terribly informed .
so we 've got 35 places , we 've got 15 priority commodities , who do we work with to change the way those commodities are produced ?
why is 25 percent important ?
it 's risk and demand .
more importantly , cargill and one other company ship 50 percent of the palm oil that goes to china .
that is an externality by definition .
or rather a cubicle , an open-space cubicle , with a lot of space .
unlike , for example israel , where audiences cough all the time .
people who made those stradivarius , amati , all those beautiful instruments .
now what does riccardo muti do ? he does something like this ...
the first one was : if you sweat by the end of the concert it means that you must have done something wrong .
audience : itay talgam : hmm ... again .
meaning that you know you have no authority to change anything .
you know what to do , even though kleiber is not conducting you .
but authority is not enough to make people your partners .
so control is no longer a zero-sum game .
and bernstein enables that . isn 't that wonderful ?
it 's traditionally called the informal economy , the underground economy , the black market .
so the implications of that are vast , because it means that this is where employment is — 1.8 billion people — and this is where we can create a more egalitarian world , because people are actually able to earn money and live and thrive , as andrew saboru did .
now , most of the phones there are not second-hand at all .
all over the world . and that company was the big german electronics giant siemens .
the first clue to the origin of starlight happened as recently as 1899 : radioactivity .
before the scientific revolution , they believed that everything important , knowable , was already known , enshrined in ancient writings , institutions , and in some genuinely useful rules of thumb -- which were , however , entrenched as dogmas , along with many falsehoods .
empiricism is inadequate because , well , scientific theories explain the seen in terms of the unseen .
you have your interpretation . we have ours .
so what was wrong with that myth , and with all pre-scientific thinking , and what , then , made that momentous difference ?
that 's a good explanation : hard to vary , because every detail plays a functional role .
it 's a fact that is , itself , unseen , yet impossible to vary . thank you .
it will take elders ' voices from the far corners of the world to call the world into balance .
when western scientists would join mau on the canoe and watch him go into the hull , it appeared that an old man was going to rest .
we 're connected 24 / 7 , yet anxiety , fear , depression and loneliness is at an all-time high .
sustainability represents the what , the where and the how of what is caught .
you 've got pole-caught yellowfin tuna here -- comes from sustainable stocks .
vegetables : they might yet save the oceans .
dan barber and alice waters are leading passionately the green food delicious revolution .
they got healthier . i made more money .
i expect that producing ingredients , preparing dishes and eating meals is all part of the communion of human interests .
we 've seen an image of our blue planet , our world bank .
he said , actually , that he believed the job of the painter was to paint everything that was visible and invisible in the universe .
and i thought to myself : what the hell have i done ?
and i realize that this object was in my mind , born from the same mind , from the same womb , practically , as barbie ballerina .
it took me a little time .
this is an object which is all about escapism .
there 's an idea that we don 't want these anxious-making , imaginative journeys to happen in our daily lives .
i let him into my life because the sèvres pink elephant vase allowed me to do so .
i 'll get your postman making dinner plans .
you might wanna avert your gaze , because that is a newt about to regenerate its limb , and shaking hands spreads more germs than kissing .
hello ! my name is golan levin .
because this is , in some sense , the first way , that people discover their own potential as actors , and discover their own agency .
so it occurred to me , what happens if we could run these backwards ?
and then a bunch of people who were like , " what 's the big deal ?
hello ? and i can ... hello ... okay .
just one eye , looking at you , and eliminating everything else about a face , but just to consider gaze in an isolated way as a kind of , as an element .
hollywood does this all the time , of course .
they did so illegally .
wild boar , lynx , moose , they 've all returned to the region in force , the very real , very negative effects of radiation being trumped by the upside of a mass exodus of humans .
they are dying of sadness . "
the world presented me with options , and i took them .
that 's not only in the developing world .
which is like yellow , this one .
so today i 'm dressed in c major , so it 's quite a happy chord .
and here 's some music translated into color .
i think life will be much more exciting when we stop creating applications for mobile phones and we start creating applications for our own body .
that disproves that popular notion that if you 're the smartest person in the room , you 're in the wrong room .
and i 'm not saying this is easy , and i 'm sure many of you have made the wrong moves too about who you wanted to connect with , but what i want to suggest is , this is an opportunity .
they could practice in their hotel room , no equipment provided .
i find it interesting that , for every one dollar we spend , however , on early childhood education , like head start , we save 17 dollars on stuff like incarceration in the future .
and andy and his team discovered that they were going to spend 200 million of those dollars on asphalt to surround the schools themselves .
most people are still unemployed , leading to most of the same kinds of social problems that unemployed people in inner cities also experience -- drug and alcohol abuse , domestic abuse , teen pregnancy and poor heath , as well .
they take a look at the demands that are out there -- beauty products , healthy schools , electricity -- and how the money 's flowing to meet those demands .
and so we know " urban ag " is a big buzz topic this time of the year , but it 's mostly gardening , which has some value in community building -- lots of it -- but it 's not in terms of creating jobs or for food production .
the recession has us reeling and fearful , and there 's something in the air these days that is also very empowering .
and sometimes i would loan him money from my after-school or summer jobs , and he always had the great intention of paying me back with interest , of course , after he hit it big .
there goes my dog who led me to the park in my wedding .
they 're essentially digital cameras .
you know ? if you want to know what i 'm made of , let 's look at me . "
the first one , the electron , was discovered in 1897 , and the last one , this thing called the tau neutrino , in the year 2000 . actually just -- i was going to say , just up the road in chicago . i know it 's a big country , america , isn 't it ?
in principle , you should be able to calculate it from that equation .
well , what the higgs does is , it gives mass to the fundamental particles .
there are many other things . you 've heard many of the big problems in particle physics .
gravity separated away from the other forces .
and i think that 's a wonderful and significant story .
amusing ? yes . desirable ? maybe .
in the case of design , that means balancing desirability , what humans need , with technical feasibility , and economic viability .
now , in the west we rely on highly trained technicians to fit these hearing aids .
so if human need is the place to start , and prototyping , a vehicle for progress , then there are also some questions to ask about the destination .
now , brunel worked at the height of the industrial revolution , when all of life and our economy was being reinvented .
so they developed and iterated these ideas .
and the reason we can do this is through an emerging technology called additive manufacturing , or 3d printing .
it 's actually using a laser to fuse the new layer of material to the old layer .
so really the resolution is quite incredible .
so it 's overall performance and efficiency just exceeds standard mass produced products .
3d printing can be also used to download spare parts from the web .
this is the sort of 3d data that a machine will read .
scanning teeth today , you can have your teeth scanned and dental coatings made in this way to fit you .
br : and we 're chefs . so when moto opened in 2004 , people didn 't really know what to expect . a lot of people thought that it was a japanese restaurant , and maybe it was the name , maybe it was the logo , which was like a japanese character , but anyway , we had all these requests for japanese food , which is really not what we did . and after about the ten thousandth request for a maki roll , we decided to give the people what they wanted . so this picture is an example of printed food , and this was the first foray into what we like to call flavor transformation . so this is all the ingredients , all the flavor of , you know , a standard maki roll , printed onto a little piece of paper .
hc : let 's talk about flavor transformation , and let 's actually make some cool stuff .
so after we do that , we put it into a vacuum bag , add a little bit of seaweed , some spices , and we roll it , and this starts taking on the appearance of tuna .
last september of 2011 , i started an online magazine for teenage girls called rookiemag.com.
so i was trying to figure all that out , and i felt a little confused , and i said so on my blog , and i said that i wanted to start a website for teenage girls that was not this kind of one-dimensional strong character empowerment thing because i think one thing that can be very alienating about a misconception of feminism is that girls then think that to be a feminist , they have to live up to being perfectly consistent in your beliefs , never being insecure , never having doubts , having all of the answers . and this is not true , and , actually , reconciling all the contradictions i was feeling became easier once i understood that feminism was not a rulebook but a discussion , a conversation , a process , and this is a spread from a zine that i made last year when i -- i mean , i think i 've let myself go a bit on the illustration front since .
now rather than just argue about this number , a copyright mathematician will analyze it and he 'll soon discover that this money could stretch from this auditorium all the way across ocean boulevard to the westin , and then to mars ...
and so the job losses that came with the internet and all that content theft , have therefore left us with negative employment in our content industries .
and i got from global security policy to food because i realized when i 'm hungry , i 'm really pissed off , and i 'm assuming that the rest of the world is too .
and the thing that 's a little strange about international hunger and talking about international issues is that most people kind of want to know : " what are you doing in america ? "
so african agriculture , which is the place of most hunger in the world , has actually fallen precipitously as hunger has risen .
so the problematic food system is affecting both hunger and obesity .
and i think by aligning international advocates that are addressing hunger and domestic advocates that are addressing obesity , we might actually look for long-term solutions that will make the food system better for everyone .
what i know about this topic comes from a qualitative study with a sample size of two .
jim died first . he was conscious until the very end , but on his last day he couldn 't talk .
prepare a one-page summary of your medical history , medications and physician information .
so , i want to start out with this beautiful picture from my childhood .
because seti doesn 't want to hear this .
but there 's two fates to everything , isn 't there ?
i mean , it must be true , because we 've had two hollywood blockbusters since that time , and this paradigm , from 1980 to about 2000 , totally changed how we geologists thought about catastrophes .
they are culturally invisible . we do not make movies about these .
the ranges of stuff -- the red line is the mass extinction .
and the last three years have seen an enormous breakthrough in a brand-new field .
we should be up to a thousand in three centuries at the most , but my friend david battisti in seattle says he thinks a 100 years .
and the reason i could do that is because we mammals have gone through a series of these hydrogen sulfide events , and our bodies have adapted .
what are you going to do ?
and we go back to the fossil record and we could try to detect how many of these have happened in the past .
and what about the waste that 's already been produced ?
we read that each year , the vancouver municipal government monitors phthalate concentration levels in rivers to assess their safety .
so jeanny and i took three of our most efficient strains and then performed gene amplification sequencing on them and matched our data with an online comprehensive database .
if we 're making plastic synthetically , then we think the solution would be to break them down biochemically .
i opened up a magazine , and visa 's branding was , " business takes simplicity . "
you know , with the pinks and blues . we can 't help but love complexity .
it 's very hard work to make tofu .
and also ikko tanaka was a very important mentor in my life -- the paul rand of japan . he designed most of the major icons of japan , like issey miyake 's brand and also muji .
i wrote computer programs to make complex graphics like this .
" eye candy " -- sort of pejorative , don 't you think ?
oh , you guys are missing out , if you haven 't done it yet .
end of story .
anyone who has kids knows that if you offer a kid a big cookie or a small cookie , which cookie are they going to take ? the big cookie .
he 's an expert in aging . this horizontal axis is how old you are -- twelve years old , twenty-four years old , seventy-four , ninety-six years old -- and this is some medical data . so , brain strength increases up to 60 , and then after 60 , it sort of goes down . kind of depressing in a way .
and this book was one of the most famous books in america for about 35 years .
one was his daughter , laurence .
everyone that blew my mind this week .
they would come into the emergency room with what the police would call " a lovers ' quarrel , " and i would see a woman who was beaten , i would see a broken nose and a fractured wrist and swollen eyes .
and so , step number two , we knew we needed to change the laws .
and so knowing that , we went to the advertising council , and we asked them to help us build a public education campaign .
we were obviously making a difference .
she sat right down next to him .
tonight , i want to have a conversation about this incredible global issue that 's at the intersection of land use , food and environment , something we can all relate to , and what i 've been calling the other inconvenient truth .
so one of the questions we 've been asking is , how much of the world is used to grow food , and where is it exactly , and how can we change that into the future , and what does it mean ?
well , this is a lot of water , and again , we 're mining water and using it to grow food , and today , if you travel down further down the colorado , it dries up completely and no longer flows into the ocean .
the soviet union didn 't really have a sierra club .
that 's more than all our transportation .
well , we could try to farm more land .
in fact , what i think they are is more like silver buckshot .
that 's the size of africa .
so where do we go from here ?
i think that we can come up with very concrete solutions on how to treat disorders .
so i can say , with some certainty , " i think , therefore i am . "
but there are about a million of them .
it 's a bit like going and cataloging a piece of the rainforest .
so there is no neuron in my brain that is the same as another , and there is no neuron in my brain that is the same as in yours .
and when they get to the synapse , what they do is they effectively , literally , shock the synapse .
so , the way that we can look at that is to ignore the neurons , ignore the synapses , and look just at the raw electrical activity .
the other chapter that i wanted to look at was how we use it -- our cities , our cars , our motorcultures , where people gather around the vehicle as a celebration .
we would have no access to love or to the ability to create .
and we could take a very simple view and say , well , it is that which we lose when we fall into deep sleep without dreams , or when we go under anesthesia , and it is what we regain when we recover from sleep or from anesthesia .
this , of course , is a visual map that i 'm showing you , but this applies to any kind of map -- auditory , for example , in relation to sound frequencies , or to the maps that we construct with our skin in relation to an object that we palpate .
and something else that happens is that those image-making regions where you have the plotting of all these neural maps , can then provide signals to this ocean of purple that you see around , which is the association cortex , where you can make records of what went on in those islands of image-making .
if you deviate too much in the parameters that are close to the midline of that life-permitting survival range , you go into disease or death .
there was a very interesting film , one of the rare good films done about a situation like this , by julian schnabel some years ago about a patient that was in that condition .
now there are three levels of self to consider -- the proto , the core and the autobiographical .
and finally , medicine .
this is 59 seconds into the film .
the first thing we did was we took a little bicycle mirror and we band-aided it here , onto a gurney , a hospital trolley , so that when you were wheeled around by a nurse or by a doctor , you could actually have a conversation with them .
and he invented the shipping container .
so , again , this idea of workarounds .
we co-opt other experiences -- we take one item and transfer it to another .
so , what came out of this ?
we had to completely transfer ourselves over to their world .
my grandmother tells me that she heard the sound of gunfire along with my first cries .
this one went as follows : all societies , regardless of culture , be it christian , muslim , confucian , must progress from traditional societies in which groups are the basic units to modern societies in which atomized individuals are the sovereign units , and all these individuals are , by definition , rational , and they all want one thing : the vote .
in other words , all the new and old democracies put together amounted to a mere fraction of what a single , one-party state did without voting .
so the party self-corrects in rather dramatic fashions .
in the larger central committee of 300 or more , the percentage of those who were born into power and wealth was even smaller .
by that point , a typical assignment will be to manage a district with a population in the millions or a company with hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue .
i said , " how about competency ? "
pollution is one . food safety . population issues .
meta-narrative is the cancer that is killing democracy from the inside .
i think many here , and in general in western countries , would agree with your statement about analysis of democratic systems becoming dysfunctional , but at the same time , many would kind of find unsettling the thought that there is an unelected authority that , without any form of oversight or consultation , decides what the national interest is .
but it 's different . you wouldn 't recognize it .
so if you look , you can see a lot of different machines come out of this . they all move around .
that 's what happened when the robots actually are rewarded for doing something .
" thank you for sharing , that 's really interesting . "
so , the idea of changing the world is really quite an extraordinary one .
that 's how ted brings these connections together .
i just , can i just say a few things about , first about cherie , because she 's a wonderful lady , my wife , with a wonderful smile .
luckily , somebody like george bush was really helpful .
how many people here are left-handed ?
but now he 's gone , and it 's great to see one of the -- arguably one of the worst speech makers in american history , now given way to one of the greatest , in obama .
and everyone goes , " great idea . "
and i , you know . "
if you 're a man in the united states of the america , you 've got about a one in two chance of being diagnosed with cancer during your lifetime .
well , what you do is , you test in animals , you test in test tubes , but there 's this notion of going from the bench to the bedside , and in order to get from the bench , the lab , to the bedside , to the patients , you 've got to get the drug tested .
so andrew said to me , he said , " what if we stop thinking about these as drugs ?
that cash flow is used , then , to buy that big portfolio of drugs that you need , and those drugs start working their way through that approval process , and each time they go through a next phase of approval , they gain value .
but it wasn 't until we actually got the popular press interested in this that we began to get some traction .
it was an invitation-only conference .
and i also was taught , coupled with that , that it was my job -- this classroom full of five and six year-old children -- it was our job , apparently , to help .
and after a while , i developed what i think many of us do , is this predictable response , where i started to feel bad every time i heard about them .
i know many in the room probably know exactly who he is , but to give the shorthand version for any who have not heard him speak , dr. yunus won the nobel peace prize a few years ago for his work pioneering modern microfinance .
their business trajectory would change .
and i learned about profit and revenue , about leverage , all sorts of things , from farmers , from seamstresses , from goat herders .
i hope that kiva can blur those lines .
when you lend them money , and they slowly pay you back over time , you have this excuse to have an ongoing dialogue .
and what you can do is go onto the site , create a profile , create investment terms in a really easy way .
thanks .
i do believe what chris said . i believe that you 're not an accident .
and i looked at it and i said , " oh , i don 't see anything . "
because as i started to say , i don 't think you 're given money or fame for your own ego , ever .
when he said the word " species , " he was revealing his worldview .
we just said , we 're not going to use it on us .
materialism is all about getting -- get , get , get , get all you can , can all you get , sit on the can and spoil the rest .
i just came off a nearly month-long speaking tour on three different continents , and i won 't go into that , but it was an amazing thing .
and so the purpose of influence is to speak up for those who have no influence .
and he picks it back up again , and it becomes a staff again .
second , it 's a symbol of not only his identity ; it 's a symbol of his income , because all of his assets are tied up in sheep .
and it represents your influence .
when my little kids were little -- they 're all grown , now i have grandkids -- i used to go in and sit on the side of their bed , and i used to watch my kids sleep .
living systems are in constant conversation with the natural world , through sets of chemical reactions called metabolism .
this is a violent process .
so when we think about scaling up metabolic materials , we can start thinking about ecological interventions like repair of atolls , or reclamation of parts of a city that are damaged by water .
an accretion itself is a huge sink of carbon dioxide .
in kenya , contested presidential elections in 2007 -- we just heard about them -- quickly led to high levels of inter-ethnic violence and the killing and displacement of thousands of people .
this decline would be even more obvious if we factored in the genocide in rwanda in 1994 .
despite centuries of animosity , decades of violence and thousands of people killed , 1998 saw the conclusion of an historic agreement .
the comprehensive peace agreement for sudan signed in 2005 turned out to be less comprehensive than envisaged , and its provisions may yet bear the seeds of a full-scale return to war between north and south .
diplomacy needs to be well resourced , sustained , and apply the right mix of incentives and pressures on leaders and followers .
carved above their door is , " free to all . "
and a book , if you had a book , is about a megabyte , so -- you know , if you had it in microsoft word .
and it turns out to not be very hard .
so the books were in the library . we could get it to people , if they 're digitized , but we didn 't know how to quite get them digitized .
well , they didn 't . they didn 't want to send their books .
and we 've been able to achieve 10 cents a page if we run things in volume .
so i think of -- we 're kind of going from the out-of-copyright , library stuff , and amazon.com is coming from the in-print world .
in the united states , it doesn 't cost you to give something away . right ?
we 're not quite a youtube .
we take a snapshot of every website and all of the pages on it , every two months .
so universal access to all knowledge -- i think it can be one of the greatest achievements of humankind , like the man on the moon , or the gutenberg bible , or the library of alexandria .
simply , if you are talented , if you have the vocation and the will to be here , you get in . you share with us and make music .
the structure of el sistema is based on a new and flexible managing style adapted to the features of each community and region , and today attends to 300,000 children of the lower and middle class all over venezuela .
it 's what makes a little girl play the clarinet at home , while her mother does the housework .
and i 'll give you some examples of what i mean .
this is the cover story .
number two , it 's imperfect ; it 's not very glamorous , and it doesn 't suddenly start and suddenly end .
quite the opposite : i actually think people are amazing and smart and that they do care .
and you have some guy that you 're not quite sure what 's wrong with him -- oliver sacks is going to be born way in the future .
these were folks that traveled from village to village , town to town , doing surgery sort of as a form of performance art .
and they came back to their american clinic and they said they had learned it was as important to wash your hands before doing surgery as it was to wash up afterwards .
and during that learning curve the complications went quite a bit higher .
you can also sew bypass vessels directly onto a beating heart without cracking the chest .
and for that reason there are many surgeries that just aren 't being done with the da vinci .
we get to write the script of the next revolution in surgery .
so this is all very prototypey at this point .
i think , how is it possible for a man with so much time to tell his story in 18 minutes ?
he said , " john , i want you to become a good herder .
they could sell these things for anything between $ 5,000 a kilo .
do you have anybody in your communities , or people , that know the bush very well and that know wildlife very well ?
the second element is that we wanted to have a life , a better life where we can benefit through many things .
but today , there are more than 130 lions .
and now , what the world really needs is for you to help me and our partners take some of what we have learned in namibia to other places with similar problems : places like mongolia , or even in your own backyards , the northern great plains , where buffalo and other animals have suffered and many communities are in decline .
not much has changed in those 50 years .
we closed broadway from 42nd street to 47th street and created two and a half acres of new pedestrian space .
and the lawn chairs became the talk of the town .
you can have fun with paint .
and you can see here that this strategy has worked .
the bikes are being used six times a day .
it 's a cognitive illusion that we 've been studying in my lab for the past few years , and 80 percent of us have it .
and this is a really important point , because we 're optimistic about ourselves , we 're optimistic about our kids , we 're optimistic about our families , but we 're not so optimistic about the guy sitting next to us , and we 're somewhat pessimistic about the fate of our fellow citizens and the fate of our country .
and it 's a global phenomenon .
number two : regardless of the outcome , the pure act of anticipation makes us happy .
in fact , without the optimism bias , we would all be slightly depressed .
so , for example , what is your likelihood of suffering from cancer ?
and using a method called functional mri , we were able to identify regions in the brain that were responding to positive information .
we made people more biased in the way that they process information .
but the good news is that becoming aware of the optimism bias does not shatter the illusion .
and so , for example -- and it 's a great second life thing -- i had a bedroom .
i think there 's a couple of things . it 's what we see in the movies -- you know , it 's this dream that we all share .
so that sort of space exploration thing is matched up here by the amount of content that 's in there , and i think that amount is critical .
so for example , c-h-a-i-r is the english word for that , but a picture of this is a universal symbol .
i think that wherever this is all going , whether it 's second life or its descendants , or something broader that happens all around the world at a lot of different points -- this is what we 're going to see the internet used for , and total traffic and total unique users is going to invert , so that the web and its bibliographic set of text and graphical information is going to become a tool or a part of that consumption pattern , but the pattern itself is going to happen mostly in this type of an environment .
i just remember it was one of those examples of data-driven design .
when people are given the opportunity to create in the world , there 's really two things they want .
and so part of what we see is the same evolution of human behavior that you see in emerging societies .
if i had to just sort of paint a broad picture , i 'd say , remember the people who were really getting into ebay in the first few years of ebay ?
that 's a frightening change , frightening disruption .
you see , titus ' car sort of resembled a car that was driven earlier in the evening by a man who raped a female hitchhiker , and titus kind of resembled that rapist .
well , titus was consumed with his civil case .
i first started studying this constructive memory process in the 1970s .
and when i began looking into these cases , i was wondering , where do these bizarre memories come from ?
i published an exposé on the case , and a little while later , the accusing daughter filed a lawsuit .
most people cherish their memories , know that they represent their identity , who they are , where they came from .
all right . there you go .
no to killing , in this case no to killing men of religion , because sheikh ahmed adina refaat was shot on december 16th , during a demonstration , leaving behind three orphans and a widow .
and in my lab , i was studying the widower effect , which is a very old idea in the social sciences , going back 150 years , known as " dying of a broken heart . "
so my first topic with respect to this , was not death , but obesity .
and it 's only when you get to your friend 's friend 's friend 's friends that there 's no longer a relationship between that person 's body size and your own body size .
was weight gain in one person actually spreading to weight gain in another person ?
i mean , there would be an advantage to experiencing our emotions inside , you know , anger or happiness .
and if you look at this image , you can right away see clusters of happy and unhappy people , again , spreading to three degrees of separation .
now , those people both have four friends , but a 's friends all know each other , and b 's friends do not .
and so some people knit together the networks around them , creating a kind of dense web of ties in which they 're comfortably embedded .
superorganisms have properties that cannot be understood just by studying the individuals .
the first one is mass .
it 's also useful if you want to put it down on your nightstand to watch a movie or use as an alarm clock , it stands .
and i think making it physical is a good way to do that .
and that got me thinking about a website that i had learned about a few months prior called change.org.
but then i started to realize something .
it 's been a roller coaster ride .
and through the children is usually the way to go .
but they do also a lot of other remarkable things .
well , basically , we dam it , we pollute it , we pour in pesticides , weedicides , fungicides .
but complacency does have a tendency to breed contempt .
and i hate to be so ironic and sarcastic about it but it 's the truth . it 's just one of the filthiest cesspools you can imagine .
we 're still working hard at it .
you know , most people are terrified of snakes .
whenever he eats the pit viper he gets this little venom rush .
it was about children who were born with deformities , and their parents felt that once they were born with those deformities , they were not good enough to live in the society , so they were given some concoction to take and as a result they died .
i show you how you stole it and when , or what you used what you had stolen to do .
and here was him , denying .
of course , drugs were abundant .
so someone sued you in court , and they took you there , and you were in remand custody for part of it , and you did that deliberately .
so instead , i turned to video , and video is the next best way to preserve and memorialize someone and to capture a specific moment in time .
i put my friends in jars , i put this character , this sort of endangered species character in a blender .
one out of every seven people .
and this was yet another famine in ethiopia .
so why is it that we have a billion people who can 't find food ?
and so today we focus on not just passing out food , but making sure the mothers have enough enrichment , and teaching them about breastfeeding .
what we have found working with the world bank is that the poor man 's safety net , the best investment , is school feeding .
well two years ago , we decided , let 's transform the model of fighting hunger , and instead of giving out the food aid , we put it into food banks .
and the women can go in and swipe and get nine food items .
and they 're doing this at huge scale after president lula declared his goal of ensuring everyone had three meals a day .
i am so honored to be here with some of the world 's top innovators and thinkers .
two-thirds of this room , today , in america , are statistically overweight or obese .
in 10 years , it 's set to double : 300 billion dollars a year .
she has six years to live .
by the way , this is what they get buried in .
the industry wants to self-police themselves .
what is school ? who invented it ? what 's the purpose of school ?
knives and forks ? no , they 're too dangerous .
jo : normal . england and america , england and america .
so , let me just show you .
they need to help us shop . they need to show us how to cook quick , tasty , seasonal meals for people that are busy .
the workplace , we haven 't really talked about it .
you know , it 's local cooks teaching local people .
they have interest sniffing each other , chasing squirrels .
every time he jumps up , he gets all sorts of abuse .
and people say , " well , i don 't know , to sit , i guess . "
and the dog can take a note , and i 've got my own little search-and-rescue dog .
all i have to do is sit , and they do everything .
there 's several definitions of what a punishment is , but one definition , the most popular , is : a punishment is a stimulus that reduces the immediately preceding behavior , such that it 's less likely to occur in the future .
your head now is 100 yards away , sailing through the air , ok ?
" johnny , don 't do that . " kick , kick , kick .
and it then starts , and we get into this thing , and our personal feedback -- there 's two things about it .
that is such a powerful training technique .
it was just going 65 -- to zero ?
in countless accidents , the driver says , " i didn 't see it coming . "
you can make reasonable predictions about how cars behave .
that guy could be a problem .
so let your car gossip about you .
girl : you 're different than anybody i 've ever met .
david is fearless of technology , and he is absolutely tenacious .
but we believed that we had a very solid methodology that might work ...
and we had enough passion to will the processes and technology into existence .
but we also looked at numbers of other films at the time that were using facial marker tracking , and that 's the idea of putting markers on the human face and doing the same process .
so this became the foundation of our research as we went forward .
now , that 's great , except we had him at age 44 .
so now , we had a 3d database of everything brad pitt 's face can do at age 87 , in his 70s and in his 60s .
and so we could choose numbers of positions on the face to pull that data from .
we also had to create an articulating tongue that allowed him to enunciate his words .
eu : that 's how to create a digital human in 18 minutes .
but you fuck one goat ... " storytelling -- is joke telling .
and he 's summoned by his rich uncle , john carter , to his mansion with a telegram saying , " see me at once . "
it confirmed something i really had a hunch on , is that the audience actually wants to work for their meal .
i took a seminar in this year with an acting teacher named judith weston .
so we 're all learning all the time .
we didn 't have any influence then , so we had a little secret list of rules that we kept to ourselves .
are you deaf ?
and it wasn 't until , on one of my later viewings , that the veil was lifted and it was in a scene where he 's walked across the sinai desert and he 's reached the suez canal , and i suddenly got it .
wonder is honest , it 's completely innocent .
i promise , i will never let anything happen to you , nemo .
and archie cochrane , as the camp doctor , was one of the first men in to clear up the mess .
and he can 't understand how this barbarism can be tolerated , and he vents his frustrations .
you know hans : the mick jagger of ted .
imagine you had one second per product category .
we clearly can .
it falls to the floor .
we have no idea why it works , no idea at all .
so i say , okay , fine .
he wanted to test out the question of , where is it that patients should recover from heart attacks ?
would you like to close down the trial now , or should we wait until we have robust results ? "
his friend , goro shimura -- who worked on the mathematics with him -- many decades later , reflected on taniyama 's life .
my grandmother was a homemaker .
so i learned to write about myself in third person at a young age .
you can go to holy name , which is coed , or st. john 's , which is all boys .
and i loved that thought , of being able to share my ideas through the printed page .
now when i was a teenager , i was angsty as any teenager was , but after 17 years of having a mother who was in and out of my life like a yo-yo and a father who was faceless , i was angry .
now , i used to work the weekends at the hole in the wall off-season programming to make some extra money as i was trying to get my feet off the ground , and this kid who was just this really hyper kid , i started calling him " monkey boy , " and i went home and wrote a book called " good night , monkey boy . "
you know ? you only get one birthday per year .
and she responded with , " i 'm here . "
and she said , " and where do , um , where do human women , like , where do women lay their eggs ? "
and she said , " mom , have you done this before ? "
and i go , " oh , it 's the same . it 's basically the same . "
i wanted to talk to you today about creative confidence .
that you don 't do things , you 're afraid you 're going to be judged .
and when they touched the snake everything was fine . they were cured .
he designs medical imaging equipment , large medical imaging equipment .
so from something like 80 percent of the kids needing to be sedated , to something like 10 percent of the kids needing to be sedated .
we 'd been working in health and wellness , and k through 12 , and the developing world .
but literally within days of arriving i was told , in no uncertain terms , by a number of west african women , that africans didn 't want saving , thank you very much , least of all not by me .
so , one week , two weeks , three weeks went by , and finally i said , " well , how about blue ? "
yes , we ran this as a business , but someone needed to pay the philanthropic support that came into the training , and the management support , the strategic advice and , maybe most important of all , the access to new contacts , networks and new markets .
so that 's about 50,000 people affected .
unicef came forward and said , " we 'll buy most of the nets , and then we 'll give them away , as part of the global fund 's and the u.n. ' s commitment to pregnant women and children , for free . "
we can start building local distribution , and actually , it can cost the public sector much less . "
but what it takes is a commitment from all of us to essentially refuse trite assumptions , get out of our ideological boxes .
and as you can see from the visuals , the service was responding and rescuing victims from the incident locations even before the police could cordon off the incident locations and formally confirm it as a terror strike .
now , let me ask you another question .
it can be worth up to one trillion dollars , being paid in bribes every year , or equal to india 's gdp .
and he did not want to pay .
in my husband 's homeland in the highlands of sulawesi island in eastern indonesia , there is a community of people that experience death not as a singular event but as a gradual social process .
and that 's exactly what i 'm saying .
it 's said in toraja that everybody has sort of a predetermined amount of life .
if we could expand our definition of death to encompass life , we could experience death as part of life and perhaps face death with something other than fear .
so if these predictions are accurate , that gap is not going to close .
i had the chance a little while back to ride in the google autonomous car , which is as cool as it sounds .
they haven 't done a darn thing to the curves .
prices stabilized , so people could plan their economic lives .
we 've also shared other sorts of entertainment -- sports arenas , public parks , concert halls , libraries , universities .
wow , that 's great . okay , thank you .
because when we buy a car we go to the dealer once , we have an interaction , and we 're chow -- usually as quickly as possible .
so people have created this business .
platforms are invitations .
and this is a very mesh-y thing .
they had some number of big successes .
you check your email while you 're sitting here .
here is an example of an abdominal ultrasound , and also a cardiac echo , which can be sent wireless , and then there 's an example of fetal monitoring on your smartphone .
what if we could reduce the need for hospital beds ?
but this monitors food , it monitors activity and tracks weight .
okay , well this was a week of my life in sleeping , and you get a z.q. score . instead of an i.q. score , you get a z.q. score when you wake up .
ok . now let 's move from sleep to diseases .
and this article from the economist summed it up beautifully about the opportunities in health across the developing world : " mobile phones made a bigger difference to the lives of more people , more quickly , than any previous technology . "
but , the future -- we can now tell who 's going to get type ii diabetes from all the common variants , and that 's going to get filled in more with low-frequency variants in the future .
they can produce loud clicks and listen for echoes from the sea floor in order to orient .
and you can see , there 's not much variability in these calls .
let 's now take a step back and see what this message can tell us about protecting dolphins from human disturbance .
to me , the most mind-bending example of the interconnectedness of the ocean comes from an acoustic experiment where oceanographers took a ship to the southern indian ocean , deployed an underwater loudspeaker and played back a sound .
unlike fins and blues , which disperse into the temperate and tropical oceans , the humpbacked whales congregate in local traditional breeding grounds , so they can make a sound that 's a little higher in frequency , broader-band and more complicated .
you hear the reverberation as the sound travels over long-range in the ocean and is not quite as loud .
so here we have the loudness of a call at the whale .
it 's as if the whole population had to shift from being basses to singing as a tenor .
the colorized area shows the risk of collision for endangered right whales because of the ships moving in this lane .
at the same time , we need to be really creative in thinking of solutions to be able to help reduce these problems .
but there was something really exciting , because i could see at a distance the tv channels covering it , and they had these big vans and the teams and the cameras , and i was basically doing the same thing and all i had was a backpack .
so the police violence against them started to grow as well .
we were covering more than 50 cities at the same time .
i said that livestream could turn the web into a colossal tv network , but i believe it does something else , because after watching people using it , not only to cover things but to express , to organize themselves politically , i believe livestream can turn cyberspace into a global political arena where everyone might have a voice , a proper voice , because livestream takes the monopoly of the broadcast political discourse , of the verbal aspect of the political dialogue out of the mouths of just politicians and political pundits alone , and it empowers the citizen through this direct and non-mediated power of exchanging experiences and dialogue , empowers them to question and to influence authorities in ways in which we are about to see .
what if , out there , others are asking and answering similar questions ?
but , this time not one billion dollars , one billion stars .
the first is that problems are inevitable .
we understand the scientific basis for the interrelatedness of life but our ego hasn 't caught up yet .
if you look very hard here you can see the signal from the voyager 1 spacecraft , the most distant human object in the universe , 106 times as far away from us as the sun is .
the first step would be to tap into the global brain trust , to build an environment where raw data could be stored , and where it could be accessed and manipulated , where new algorithms could be developed and old algorithms made more efficient .
at these large-scale construction sites in china , you see a sort of makeshift camp where workers live during the entire building process .
slowly , from found materials , walls rise , and people create a space out of any found objects or materials .
on this particular evening , i came across this live band dressed to the t in their coordinating outfits .
despite having limited access to space and money , the homes in the area are designed with care and detail .
now imagine what these already ingenious communities could create themselves , and how highly particular their solutions would be , if they were given the basic infrastructures that they could tap into .
our journey did not , in fact , begin at hercules inlet , where frozen ocean meets the land of antarctica .
what do you eat ? one of my favorite dishes on expedition : butter and bacon . it 's about a million calories .
imagine being 13 years old , hearing those words , and believing it .
i saw one of them that featured a kitten and her mom and wishing her mom a happy mother 's day .
i 'm not so sure we should be thinking of young people as digital natives .
let me show you about what it 's like to code in scratch .
so i 'm going to let all of you control this game using your voices .
i 'll call it score .
it 's probably not so likely , but regardless of what he does , he 'll be able to make use of these design skills that he learned .
for kids like me , being called childish can be a frequent occurrence .
for instance , the museum of glass in tacoma , washington , my home state -- yoohoo washington !
okay , so they didn 't tell us to become doctors or lawyers or anything like that , but my dad did read to us about aristotle and pioneer germ fighters when lots of other kids were hearing " the wheels on the bus go round and round . "
no , really , we are going to be the next generation , the ones who will bring this world forward .
so here 's the metaphor i 'm offering today .
this is from a 16th century aztec scroll showing a man about to eat a psilocybin mushroom and at the same moment get yanked up the staircase by a god .
the lower level he called the level of the profane .
so here 's the million-dollar question for social scientists like me : is the staircase a feature of our evolutionary design ?
the slowest rowers , the weakest rowers , are going to get cut from the team .
we start with just one green , and as it interacts it gains wealth or points or food .
and the most cohesive hives won , just as darwin said .
i can 't be certain if the staircase is an adaptation rather than a bug , but if it is an adaptation , then the implications are profound .
come , have a seat in my home entertainment center .
and if they exist and you can find them , then maybe one could eventually do something about it .
you can see the little head moving down at the bottom there .
well as you know , genes , which are part of the dna , they 're instructions to make a protein that does something .
insulin is a hormone that promotes the uptake of nutrients into your tissues after you eat a meal .
it turns out that these long-lived mutants are more resistant to all these diseases .
these animals have within them the latent capacity to live much longer than they normally do .
and they all come and they fortify the house .
but in this case , there 's already a drug called rapamycin that binds to the tor protein and inhibits its activity .
and i think that 's much better , that kind of control would be much better as a drug .
mr : but what you 're talking about here is not extending human lifespan by preventing death , so much as extending human youthspan .
you can see the three-light transom there with the eyebrow windows -- certainly an architectural antique headed to the landfill .
it doesn 't look like a can of beer , but the design take-offs are absolutely unmistakable .
it 's a pretty panel of glass .
if i took a bite out of it , you 'd go , " wait a second .
and in there he said that cultures tend to swing between one of two perspectives .
well , trees don 't grow two inches by four inches , eight , ten and twelve feet tall .
" good call , tulles . from now on , you guys hit this pile first . "
" no , no . we had a wind last night .
in there he talked about the divided self .
we do what that group does that we 're trying to identify with .
but that 's okay .
these rocks have been hitting our earth for about three billion years , and are responsible for much of what 's gone on on our planet .
we are living at the age here at the end of the book , where electronic paper will undoubtedly replace it .
it 's designed like an escher print .
but we can also look at an enigma machine from the nazis in world war ii that was a coding and decoding machine .
so the next time you download a gigabyte , or two gigabytes , it 's not for free , ok ?
and if you are a boy , you 're four times as likely to be diagnosed with adhd -- attention deficit hyperactivity disorder .
the first is zero tolerance .
" i want to write about video games . i want to write about leveling-up .
so that may be a very direct way that we see it happen .
and so this is a very serious problem . where is it coming from ?
we need to think about how to uncompress this curriculum if we can , trying to bring boys back into a space that is comfortable for them .
because , ultimately , if we don 't , then we 're going to have boys who leave elementary school saying , " well i guess that was just a place for girls .
it knows how much it 's moving .
data : here 's the first one .
i can help .
thank you very much .
and just assume that we will be collecting data during five seconds , and that would correspond to one terabyte of data -- that 's 800,000 books and 16 kilometers of phone books .
i want to look at the heart .
so i 'm going to show you a few examples of what we can do .
first you saw the body bag that the body came in , then i 'm peeling off the skin -- you can see the muscles -- and eventually you can see the bone structure of this woman .
here 's another violent case . this really didn 't kill the person .
it 's really a hands-on experience .
and this is karljohan , one of my graduate students who 's been working on this project .
so motts is doing something here , and probably he is going like this with his right hand , because the left side is activated on the motor cortex .
now we 're also having a bit of fun at the center .
it 's a huge effort that goes into doing this , gathering the data and developing the algorithms , writing all the software .
and it was gut wrenching .
and when you think about it , it 's very true : what we all most desire is a penis -- or " happiness " as we say in english .
number one : do nothing . this thing ain 't broke , so i ain 't gonna fix it .
and more important , i think , the ideas that are exhibited and realized here are ideas that the foundation can use , because there 's fantastic synergy .
but in the meantime i invite you to imagine the day when we might journey to the saturnine system , and visit the enceladus interplanetary geyser park , just because we can .
why did america get serious ?
that is still the waterfront of effective policies : aid , trade , security , governments .
so , here comes a bit of science , and this is a bit of science i 've done since " the bottom billion , " so it 's new .
the best growth rates they 've had -- ever .
the simple proposal is that we should have some international standards , which will be voluntary , but which would spell out the key decision points that need to be taken in order to harness these resource revenues .
if the british treasury can be out by a factor of 10 , think what the ministry of finance in sierra leone is going to be like .
i spent the best part of last year working on a documentary about my own happiness -- trying to see if i can actually train my mind in a particular way , like i can train my body , so i can end up with an improved feeling of overall well-being .
if you 're ugly or if you 're really , really good-looking it makes no difference whatsoever .
now i , of course , thought , " well this is american data , " and i thought , " well , those silly americans .
and lately , to be involved in projects where i know about 50 percent of the project technique-wise and the other 50 percent would be new .
all this noise around us actually has information .
it turns out what we found was pretty surprising .
so what ?
how do we end a war like iraq ?
it 's moved up again . the groups are more fragmented .
so let 's go back , and i 'll show you what you saw . there was a lot there .
space that exists within us , and without us .
so , imagine we 're in the middle of america .
you can see i don 't do much . i 'm just standing there , again with my eyes closed , and other people are molding me , evidential .
the pieces appear and disappear , but maybe more importantly -- this is just looking north from the center of the installation -- they create a field , a field that involves living and the surrogate bodies in a kind of relation , a relation with each other and a relation with that limit , the edge , the horizon .
but this is a space that is actually filled with people , disembodied voices , and out of that ambient environment , when people come close to your own body zone , very close , they appear to you as representations .
the water had started coming back . it was foaming over the reef .
we think this boat is going to phuket hospital , but if it 's too dangerous to land at its pier , then perhaps it will go to krabi instead , which is more protected .
they said , " the blogsters let us down . "
so , i think the first thing that the blogosphere tells us is that we need to expand our idea of what counts as rational , and we need to expand our simple equation of value equals money , or , you have to pay for it to be good , but that in fact you can end up with collectively really brilliant products without any money at all changing hands .
so , that 's the positive side of it .
the metaphor that i like to use is the metaphor of the circular mill .
laughter is contagious . passion is contagious .
that 's them rolling .
here was a city telling its child , " you can . "
and they did . stories of change poured in from all over india , from nagaland in the east , to jhunjhunu in the west , from sikkim in the north , to krishnagiri in the south .
first they have cleaned the society , then it will be hyderabad , and soon india .
thank you .
thank you .
i 'd always told myself there 's no reason to share that i was gay , but the idea that my silence has social consequences was really driven home this year when i missed an opportunity to change the atmosphere of discrimination in my own home state of kansas .
and then i wrote a note to myself at the bottom : " remember this . "
it was a very tragic time . it was a very difficult time .
there is more that we 're doing to explore this idea of collective intelligence , that i , as a citizen , if i share the information with whatever device that i have , could inform you about what is going on , and that if you do the same , we can have a bigger picture of what 's going on .
we 've built a crowd map , we 've built ushahidi .
and for us , we begin with solving the problem in our own backyard in kenya .
and so this has raised a bunch of problems for them when dealing with these sorts of issues .
now there 's a whole range of different sorts of non-lethal weapons , some of which are obviously available now , some of which they 're developing .
so their attitudes to the use of lethal force are very different , and i think it 's fairly obvious that their attitude to the use of non-lethal weapons would also be very different from what it is with the police .
and the red arrow represents the point where queensland actually said , " yes , this is where we 're going to give all police officers across the entire state access to o.c. spray . "
now one of the particular issues that comes up with military use of non-lethal weapons -- and people when they 're actually saying , " well hey , there might be some problems " -- there 's a couple of particular problems that get focused on .
second problem that people sometimes talk about with military use of non-lethal weapons , and it 's actually the reason why in the chemical weapons convention , it 's very clear that you can 't use riot control agents as a weapon of warfare , the problem with that is that it 's seen that sometimes non-lethal weapons might actually be used , not as an alternative to lethal force , but as a lethal force multiplier -- that you use non-lethal weapons first so that your lethal weapons will actually be more effective .
and it 's all captured by the video camera running in the front of the police car .
because police are actually more restrained in the use of force than the military are .
and for dollars , is their 30 million , plus the 20 million dollars from the american manufacturer .
the other thing that happened is -- i put them on youtube just -- i saw no reason to make it private , so i let other people watch it , and then people started stumbling on it , and i started getting some comments and some letters and all sorts of feedback from random people from around the world .
it was very strange for me to do something of social value .
so once the khan academy -- i quit my job and we turned into a real organization -- we 're a not-for-profit -- the question is , how do we take this to the next level ?
but as ridiculous as that sounds , that 's exactly what 's happening in our classrooms right now .
further down , you start getting into algebra one , algebra two , a little bit of precalculus .
now i come from a very data-centric reality , so we don 't want that teacher to even go and intervene and have to ask the kid awkward questions : " oh , what do you not understand ? " or " what do you do understand ? "
and so the same kids that you thought were slow six weeks ago , you now would think are gifted .
thank you .
i think what they 're excited about is they can now follow these kids .
the idea there is , if i 'm confused about a topic , somehow right in the user interface i 'd find people who are volunteering , maybe see their reputation , and i could schedule and connect up with those people ?
and this first hotel that i bought , motel , was a pay-by-the-hour , no-tell motel in the inner-city of san francisco .
but given my befuddled state of mind , i ended up in the self-help section very quickly .
our employee turnover dropped to one-third of the industry average , and during that five year dotcom bust , we tripled in size .
now , in essence , the king was asking us to consider an alternative definition of success , what has come to be known as gnh , or gross national happiness .
and it focuses on something i read long ago from a guy named rabbi hyman schachtel .
so it suggests that the momentum is shifting .
we 're not asking anything that 's intangible .
they 've created a habitat of happiness for dave .
well , what then happened over the last 50 or 60 years , is that goods have become commoditized .
all of these are experiences .
and they realize , i 'm right !
when you think about that , let me go back to what lionel trilling , in his seminal book on authenticity , " sincerity and authenticity " -- came out in 1960 -- points to as the seminal point at which authenticity entered the lexicon , if you will .
now , the other two sides of the coin are : being a real fake -- is what it says it is , but is not true to itself , or being a fake real : is true to itself , but not what it says it is .
right , the key of being true to yourself is knowing who you are as a business .
right , it 's not advertising does it .
superconductivity is a quantum state of matter , and it occurs only below a certain critical temperature .
why ? because it is a quantum phenomenon . it 's quantum physics .
why ? because as long as it rotates , the locking is maintained .
but we can also store energy using superconductors , because we have no dissipation .
this is me in the middle making faces .
there i would hear people say my father was a " moudjahid " and that means " fighter . "
his parents were of russian descent .
as a " dyer , " do you know how to bleach ink marks ?
i 'd like to talk about those sacrifices , because there were many .
and then i understood that asking my father so many questions was stirring up a whole past he probably didn 't feel like talking about because it was painful .
but , he agreed to do it , even though daniel cohn-bendit 's life was not in danger , just because it was a good opportunity to mock the authorities , and to show them that there 's nothing more porous than borders -- and that ideas have no borders .
dna analysis , one of the hallmarks of the scientific revolution of the last 400 years that he started , was the way we found which set of bones actually belonged to the person who read all those astronomical books which were filled with leftover hair that was copernicus ' hair -- obviously not many other people bothered to read these books later on .
the way we do that , actually , is with a method , which we call the transit method .
now the total planet number in our solar system was nine .
most of these are candidates .
and here comes biology -- biology , with its basic question , which still stands unanswered , which is essentially : " if there is life on other planets , do we expect it to be like life on earth ? "
so that 's what we are building from the left side of the river .
we know that .
think about those oldest living things on earth , but in a cosmic proportion .
to get a sense of this , and it 's been a theme we 've talked about all week , i recently talked to a bunch of tweeners .
the next year they march forward and they introduce qube , the first interactive cable tv system , and the new york times heralds this as telecommunications moving to the home , convergence , great things are happening .
i mean , how did a machine that was built for accounting and artillery morph into media ?
cb : looks very good to me .
this had the first pointing device . it was distributed , so it worked out -- distributed computing and modems -- so all these things could talk to each other .
a new technology has confounded radio men and movie moguls and they 're quite certain that television is about to do them in .
turns out they told us directly that these are the only crayons you should ever use with your winky dink magic window , other crayons may discolor or hurt the window .
and so the global village is as big as a planet , and as small as a village post office .
they saw these tools that were controlled by the establishment as ones that could actually be liberated and put to use by these communities that they were trying to build .
the method we illustrate in this video uses a pre-made videodisc but creates custom hypercard stacks .
never had scientists been put under such pressure and demand .
thomas edison had the same problem .
but i , yeah , i think there 's an opportunity . as the strike continues , there 's an opportunity for more people to experience video on places like myspace tv .
and media companies realize the audience is important also .
nadia al-sakkaf : well , i 'm glad to be here .
but we want to tell the world that , no , under the one flag , we 'll still remain as yemeni people .
and in my third year , i started becoming confused because i was yemeni , but i was also mixing up with a lot of my friends in college .
it 's about proving who you are and what you can do .
we started with , you can take it off in the office .
it 's very important for you to go to yementimes.com , and it 's very important to listen to our voice .
n well there is a saying that says , " you fear what you don 't know , and you hate what you fear . "
it 's the hardest thing i 've ever attempted , and there have been plenty of times when i felt like backing out .
and where that energy touches water , something new emerges : life .
lichens arose as a co-op . fungi married algae ...
in australia , a lily turned into a grass tree , and in hawaii , a daisy became a silver sword .
walruses adapted with layers of fat . sea lions got sleek .
looking deeply inside nature through the magnifying glass of science , designers extract principles , processes and materials that are forming the very basis of design methodology , from synthetic constructs that resemble biological materials to computational methods that emulate neural processes , nature is driving design .
technology had eliminated my disability and allowed me a new climbing prowess .
to that end , we used imaging tools such as mri to look inside my body to figure out the geometries and locations of various tissues .
the button 's pushed , voltage is applied , and it stiffens , offering me a greater maneuverability of the bionic limb .
we 're also building exoskeletal structures using these same principles that wrap around a biological limb .
so , when this is fully developed and for human use , persons like myself will not only have synthetic limbs that move like flesh and bone , but actually feel like flesh and bone .
as a society , we can achieve these human rights if we accept the proposition that humans are not disabled .
in 200 days , we put her back .
this photo taken just before his death — — is actually a — no , one reason this photo is interesting is because most people would not do this , and if they did , they would not live to tell it , because fear would have kicked in a long time ago to a natural predator .
so when one disgusting thing touches a clean thing , that clean thing becomes disgusting , not the other way around .
if you ask enough of these , you can get a general overall score of disgust sensitivity .
disgust didn 't influence attitudes toward all the other social groups that we asked , including african-americans , the elderly . it really came down to the attitudes they had toward gay men .
the science writers and editors -- i shouldn 't say science writers , i should say people who write about science -- and editors would sit down over a couple of beers , after a hard day of work , and start talking about some of these incredible perceptions about how the universe works .
we are all much healthier than we were 20 years ago .
in a few years , nasa is going to launch four or five telescopes out to jupiter , where there 's less dust , and start looking for earth-like planets , which we cannot see with present technology , nor detect .
last july , in science , the journal science , 19 oceanographers published a very , very unusual article .
there 's been an experiment for the last four or five years on the georges bank , or the grand banks off of newfoundland . it 's a no-take fishing zone .
secondly , we have a natural laboratory surrounding the earth .
sp : so , what can we do about this ? oh , by the way , we 're overdue .
obviously , we don 't want one of those .
and we know staph can do amazing things .
most of them should be in orbit around something .
a small asteroid , say a half mile wide , would touch off firestorms followed by severe global cooling from the debris kicked up -- carl sagan 's nuclear winter thing .
but it 's going to take them 10 years , at spending three million dollars a year , and even then , they claim they 'll only have about 80 percent of them catalogued .
we don 't want to get caught flat-footed again .
but as we age , our organs tend to fail more .
so , salamanders can do it .
this was an injured urethra on the left side .
that 's what you 're seeing here . you 're seeing this muscle bio-reactor actually exercising the muscle back and forth .
but they are really acting mostly as conduits .
and i 'm sure everyone here wanted an extra-large . right ?
this is actually one of the strategies . we use a printer .
we perfuse the outside of the liver with the patient 's own liver cells .
a windpipe cell already knows it 's a windpipe cell .
but actually method a is the correct approach .
i 'm here to tell you the secret to successful decision-making : a cheese sandwich .
but the problem is that this kind of thing happens all the time , and it affects not just the stories you read in the news but also the products you see on the shelves .
now let me pause here and take a moment to say that neuroscience has advanced a lot in the last few decades , and we 're constantly discovering amazing things about the brain .
this time it 's not a cheese sandwich .
but these clinics have treated tens of thousands of patients to date , many of them children , and spect imaging involves a radioactive injection , so exposing people to radiation , potentially harmful .
we americans bought alaska in the 1850s . it 's called seward 's folly .
and we knew nothing about going to space .
we 've done two so far . we 'll be announcing two more on the soyuz to go up to the space station for 20 million dollars .
today 's commercial markets worldwide , global commercial launch market ?
see , the insurance companies went to boeing and lockheed , and said , " are you going to compete ? " no .
pd : that was filmed inside our airplane , and so , you can now do this .
it may or may not happen . but if you put up a prize , the beautiful thing is , you know , it 's a very small maintenance fee , and you pay on success .
she said , " be good to your friends .
well , she and i went blackberry picking .
i went up to him and said , how can i learn that ?
they would just take a stick and a catgut and string it up .
you don 't know how hard it is to earn money . your dad works so hard .
he just sang : " well , there 's a long white robe in heaven , i know .
and it also can bring the group together in a way that nothing else can .
and i don 't want it to leave me behind .
fifteen years ago , 14 years ago , i guess , this year , my wife and i lost our daughter , sarah jane , in a car accident , and it was the most -- it almost took me out -- it almost took me out of this world .
while you can hardly move , they 're running around having all kinds of fun .
man , we were only 10 , but we knew that made gunpowder .
he said , " yeah , hey , it 's melting . yeah , the sulfur 's melting .
i 'm going to define what the terms of my success are . "
here , just for historical authenticity , is a picture of me in that year .
the phone rang and it was my doctor .
this is much sharper than an ultrasound would be .
and what i found was on other websites , even by the third page of google results , " outlook is bleak " , " prognosis is grim . "
it 's really serious .
and the story of how all that happens is in this book .
she came to realize that there were a lot of people who 'd written patient advocate books that you just don 't hear about at medical conferences .
but you see , it 's still generic .
what she was able to do was because she had access to the raw data .
in professional circles everywhere , it 's of course universally accepted .
i think they 're right that evolution is fundamentally hostile to religion .
it turns out to be , in principle , incapable of doing the job required of it .
perfectly ordinary scientific paper .
as has been said before , we are all atheists about most of the gods that humanity has ever believed in . some of us just go one god further .
that is , the higher one 's intelligence or educational level , the less one is likely to be religious . "
on the contrary , they 'll demonstrate that atheists are often the kinds of people that could serve as decent role models for your children , the kinds of people an advertising agent could use to recommend a product , the kinds of people who are sitting in this room .
you think we might have grown up since then .
it lacks the strong connotation that there 's definitely no god , and it could therefore easily be embraced by teapot or tooth fairy agnostics .
well , here 's how it changed me .
water 's pumped from the lake and is filtered and shot as a fine mist through an array of high-pressure fog nozzles , 35,000 of them . and a weather station is on the structure .
you know , when we did this project it was a kind of tough sell , because the swiss said , " well , why are we going to spend , you know , 10 million dollars producing an effect that we already have in natural abundance that we hate ? "
and we actually had to install white walls to separate these pieces , which didn 't belong together .
so rather than securing a neutral background for the artworks on display , the wall now actively competed for attention .
so , it 's already sticking out into space enough , and then from that is this , is this small area called the mediatheque .
so , the hall is a multi-purpose hall .
so now that we 've stripped the hall of all visual distraction , everything that prevents this intimacy which is supposed to connect the house , the audience , with the performers , we add one little detail , one piece of architectural excess , a special effect : lighting .
but if you have to have an operation , what you really want is a minimally invasive operation .
if you need surgery , you want to be operated on by a board-certified surgeon .
so here 's allan teaching an english-speaking surgeon in africa these basic fundamental skills necessary to do minimally invasive surgery .
here in the united states we spend more money per person for outcomes that are not better than many countries in the world .
it starts with a framework system where when the surgeon delivers the lecture using a framework of captioning technology , we then add another technology to do video conferencing .
it 's important to be accurate .
they were making it possible for us to do what they do , and yet , they didn 't really understand how they did it .
so these things are kind of relative to where you or your ancestors happen to stand .
the paige typesetter had 18,000 parts .
they were working on it independently , and they weren 't getting anywhere .
one other very positive consequence of 20th century technology , though , was the way in which other kinds of calamities could lead to positive advances .
we need to take a really positive view .
well , cèilidh first of all is gaelic for party , but kitchen party in cape breton is very common , and basically somebody drops into the house , and no matter what house you go to in cape breton , there 's a fiddle there , guaranteed , and i 'd say , well there 's first of all more fiddlers per capita in cape breton than anywhere in the world , so ten chances to one , the fellow who walked in the door could play it , so you 'd have someone come into the house , you 'd invite them to play a tune , and lo and behold a little party would start up and somebody would dance , and somebody would sing , and all that sort of thing , so it was a wonderful , wonderful way to grow up , and that is where my beginnings in music come from : my surroundings , my family , just my bloodline in itself , and , oh , i 've done lots of things with my music .
well i guess i have to now .
dl : with one minute .
anyway , i 'm blabbering on here .
so let 's start talking about that .
and that , of course , is the reason why all of you are making such generous and wonderful donations to these nice folks .
this stuff is getting serious enough that if we don 't start paying attention to the deficit , we 're going to end up losing the dollar .
if you 're 50 to 60 we want you to work two years more .
now , right behind the financial crisis there 's a second and bigger wave that we need to talk about .
first they don 't grow .
an almost-extinct animal from xochimilco , mexico called an axolotl that can re-generate its limbs .
but , i mean it gets more interesting .
this is not an intelligence turing rest , but this is as close as you can get to a physical turing test .
this is a group in germany that 's beginning to engineer eyes so that people who are blind can begin to see light and dark .
maybe not .
and this is a spearing mantis shrimp , or stomatopod .
and believe it or not , they went for it .
and what this basically consists of is a large muscle that takes a good long time to contract , and a latch that prevents anything from moving .
the saddle is outlined in yellow . you can actually see it extending over the course of the strike , and actually hyperextending .
so these animals are wonderfully aggressive , and are really hungry all the time . and so all i had to do was actually put a little shrimp paste on the front of the load cell , and they 'd smash away at it .
here 's that same orientation that we saw earlier .
so , really fascinating double whammy , so to speak , from these animals .
so to conclude , i mostly want to acknowledge my two collaborators , wyatt korff and roy caldwell , who worked closely with me on this .
and it 's africa that stands out as the problem down here , doesn 't it ?
and they lost one-fifth of their kids before their first birthday .
and down in 1915 , the united states was a neighbor of india -- present , contemporary india .
and i 'm going to stage a race here between this sort of yellowish ford here and the red toyota down there , and the brownish volvo .
that 's when i believe statistics , when it 's grandma-verified statistics .
well , you see the nice story of getting richer and getting healthier -- everyone did it at the cost of emission of carbon dioxide .
and we drive away here -- we find the first garden in the street , and they earn 10 to 50 dollars a day .
when you 're in poverty , everything is about survival .
africa has not done bad .
if you are fighting in a non-governmental organization , you love equity between gender .
health i give two points . i mean it 's nice to be healthy -- at my age especially -- you can stand here , you 're healthy .
and i 'm going to take this blade of steel , and push it down through my body of blood and flesh , and prove to you that the seemingly impossible is possible .
what i 'm going to show you for a couple of minutes is a facility that i built in the toughest neighborhood in pittsburgh with the highest crime rate .
and so the first thing that you see in my center in the springtime is water that greets you -- water is life and water of human possibility -- and it sets an attitude and expectation about how you feel about people before you ever give them a speech .
and so in my building , which is full of sunlight and full of flowers , we believe in hope and human possibilities .
that 's puff pastry day . why ?
what we 've discovered is you have to give them flowers and sunlight and food and expectations and herbie 's music , and you can cure a spiritual cancer every time .
let me show you what these people do .
at the last show that we did , 200 parents showed up and we didn 't pick up one parent .
and that 's the room that 's initiating the relationship .
when the basie band came , the band got so excited about the school they voted to give me the rights to the music .
this was burned out during the riots -- this is next to my building -- and so i had another cardboard box built and i walked back out in the streets again .
the brown building is the one you guys have been looking at and i 'll tell you where i made my big mistake .
i said , " well , where would you build this thing ? "
and i went down into the neighborhood called bayview-hunters point , and i said , " the mayor sent me down here to work with you and i want to build a center with you , but i 'm not going to build you anything if you don 't want it .
i want you all to know that i think the world is a place that 's worth living .
what you 're drawn to are her eyes and the skin you love to touch .
if they do so at the appropriate time , the black box lights up and a panda bear pounds a drum .
and those distributions grow .
here 's what it looked like in the laboratory .
we 're the first in the world to record babies in an meg machine while they are learning .
it 's a worry -- isn 't it ? -- that the rest of the world 's media is doing such a bad job that a little group of activists is able to release more of that type of information than the rest of the world press combined .
and when kibaki got into power -- through a coalition of forces that were trying to clean up corruption in kenya -- they commissioned this report , spent about two million pounds on this and an associated report .
c 'mon , fire !
you have guys walking in a relaxed way down the street , and then an apache helicopter sitting up at one kilometer firing 30-millimeter cannon shells on everyone -- looking for any excuse to do so -- and killing people rescuing the wounded .
but are there risks with that , either to the individuals concerned or indeed to society at large , where leaking can actually have an unintended consequence ?
we don 't have sources who are dissidents on other sources .
so we were kind of skeptical that maybe it was a competing oil firm just sort of playing the issue up .
i mean , we 're an organization that is hard to grow very quickly because of the sort of material we deal with , so we have to restructure in order to have people who will deal with the highest national security stuff , and then lower security cases .
capable , generous men do not create victims ; they nurture victims ?
j i 'm not sure which way it 's going to go .
there seems to be a rule in nature that if you get too close to where you came from , it gets ugly .
go ahead and congratulate yourself give yourself a hand , the hand is your hand and the eye that eyes itself is your eye and the ear that hears itself is near ' cause it 's your ear , oh oh you 've done the impossible now took yourself apart you made yourself invulnerable no one can break your heart so you wear it out and you wring it out and you wear it out and you break it yourself breaking your own , break it yourself breaking your own , break it yourself breaking your own thanks .
as neuroscientists , we work in the lab with mice trying to understand how memory works .
so whenever a memory is being formed , any active cells for that memory will also have this switch installed .
xl : yep . you heard it right .
but what if we put the mouse in this new box but at the same time , we activate the fear memory using lasers just like we did before ?
and then we published our findings in the journal nature .
we can shoot light into the brain to reactivate the memory of the blue box .
how do we push this technology forward ?
and many of these technologies -- speaking as a physician and innovator -- we can really start to leverage to impact the future of our own health and of health care , and to address many of the major challenges that we have in health care today , ranging from the really exponential costs to the aging population , the way we really don 't use information very well today , the fragmentation of care and often the very difficult course of adoption of innovation .
let 's start with faster .
oh , we might have missed it , but using a.i. on top of radiology , we can find lesions that were missed before .
the ability to interact with your health care provider is different .
there 's even mirrors today that can pick up your pulse rate .
for those who have disabilities -- the paraplegic -- there 's the era of brain-computer interface , or bci , where chips have been put on the motor cortex of completely quadriplegic patients and they can control a curser or a wheelchair or , eventually , a robotic arm .
on the cardiac side , pacemakers are getting smaller and much easier to place so you don 't need to train an interventional cardiologist to place them .
we 're now approaching essentially a thousand-dollar genome -- probably next year to two years , probably a hundred-dollar genome .
this has been called by lee hood , the father of the field , p4 medicine .
so i 've studied a lot about stem cells -- embryonic stem cells are particularly powerful .
but often it 's too late and it 's stage iii or iv cancer , for example .
and so i set out with this concept , scientifically , that artistic creativity , it 's magical , but it 's not magic , meaning that it 's a product of the brain .
now the way that 's done is by the following .
and so the experiment really rests on the following : what happens in the brain during something that 's memorized and over-learned , and what happens in the brain during something that is spontaneously generated , or improvised , in a way that 's matched motorically and in terms of lower-level sensory motor features ?
as i like to say , these are not the " jazz areas " of the brain .
and then i 'm in the control room here , playing back and forth .
and let 's go ahead and play this video here .
whether or not you like the music is irrelevant .
but the pace of exponential growth is really what describes information technologies .
the logarithmic scale hides the scale of the increase , because this represents trillions-fold increase since the 1890 census .
i 've been making these forward-looking predictions for about 30 years .
but where will we get the software ?
it 's a new university that 's founded by peter diamandis , who is here in the audience , and myself .
and what 's happening is that there 's a globalization of illness occurring , that people are starting to eat like us , and live like us , and die like us . and in one generation , for example , asia 's gone from having one of the lowest rates of heart disease and obesity and diabetes to one of the highest . and in africa , cardiovascular disease equals the hiv and aids deaths in most countries .
that 's the honest truth .
the first thing i want to talk about is that when all of this money flowed into our country about 40 years ago , we embarked , the government of the day embarked on a series of government-to-government arrangements to have rapidly develop the country .
and it was called , those people are called the piarco airport accused .
we were trying to build , or reconstruct largely , an airport that had grown outdated .
what if it had happened before ? how would i find out ?
in africa , they 've had bailouts . in nigeria , six of the major commercial banks collapsed at the same time as ours , eh ?
so i plunged into this struggle , and i asked four questions .
and he was able to get the court , using that act of parliament , freedom of information act , to release the information , and i thought that was excellent .
we will continue to work within jcc .
one of my driving passions is this idea of exploring nature , and trying to find hidden data within nature .
and the list of scientific applications is growing every day .
and think about the immense sound of the universe forming .
forty-seven out of those 53 were unreplicable .
so this is a drug called reboxetine , and this is a drug that i myself have prescribed . it 's an antidepressant .
this is a cancer at the core of evidence-based medicine .
but people didn 't bother to use those registers .
when i was growing up , my heroes were people like fred astaire , gene kelly , michael jackson .
please be excited , have fun , yell , scream .
you know , you create power , then you tame it .
so they 're skin cells that can be tricked , kind of like cellular amnesia , into an embryonic state .
by combining tissue engineering techniques with microfluidics , the field is actually evolving towards just that , a model of the entire ecosystem of the body , complete with multiple organ systems to be able to test how a drug you might take for your blood pressure might affect your liver or an antidepressant might affect your heart .
i 'll see what i can do . ok ?
stonehenge is the remnant of a chiefdom , which is what you get with the invention of agriculture : multi-village polity with centralized rule .
first of all , it can accommodate ; it doesn 't deny the existence of inequality exploitation war .
and one reason is because of something i call the " growing lethality of hatred . "
in my defense , i 'd say , as naive as this may sound , it 's ultimately grounded in cynicism .
it 's especially hard to do when people hate you , ok , because you don 't really , in a sense , want to completely understand why people hate you .
what i want to talk to you about is what we can learn from studying the genomes of living people and extinct humans .
and we will find that the two genomes in me , or one genome of mine we want to use , will have about three million differences in the order of that .
and we can begin to say how much variance do we find , how many letters that vary in at least one of those individual sequences .
so there 's another interesting thing that comes from this realization that humans have a recent common origin in africa , and that is that when those humans emerged around 100,000 years ago or so , they were not alone on the planet .
the same is true if we look at a chinese individual versus an african , the neanderthal will match the chinese individual more often .
then modern humans emerged somewhere in africa , came out of africa , presumably in the middle east .
here 's my favorite bonehead concept from the 1990s in the pentagon : the theory of anti-access , area-denial asymmetrical strategies .
i don 't know , the million man swim .
problem is , the defense department over here beats the hell out of you .
but it 's not a perfect world , and your administration isn 't getting us any closer . "
it 's the imf sovereign bankruptcy plan , ok ?
what we do have is the u.s.-enabled leviathan force that says , " you want me to take that guy down ? i 'll take that guy down .
no looting , no military disappearing , no arms disappearing , no ammo disappearing , no muqtada al-sadr -- i 'm wrecking his bones -- no insurgency .
you tell me it 's too hard to do .
actually , most of them .
some people put these two things together and they call it empire , which i think is a boneheaded concept .
to attack america is to risk blowing up the world .
i knew we 'd have a hard time with what followed .
you break out that leviathan force only every so often .
the force on the left respects posse comitatus restrictions on the use of force inside the u.s.
we 're going to have a department of something else between war and peace .
armor goes this way .
reserve component -- national guard reserves overwhelmingly sys admin .
many of them are trying to kill us from the minute we go into them , but nevertheless , they 're absolutely gripping , and contain unbelievable biological wonders that are very , very different from those that we have on the planet .
and that took what had been a tiny little astronomical object in the sky , that you would see as a dot , and turned it completely into a landscape , as that very first primitive picture came rastering across the screen .
and those planetary systems are going to be very common .
because if it 's big and obvious , we would 've already found it -- it would 've already bitten us on the foot , and it hasn 't .
i always turn my head on the side , and that simple change makes me go from seeing this planet as home , to seeing it as a planet .
and yet , everything in this cave has adapted to it .
the sub-surface of earth contains a vast biodiversity .
i want to talk specifically about the array that you see on the top .
did life start here and was it transported there ?
so we 're probably not doing a great job when it comes to risk taking .
behavioral finance is really a combination of psychology and economics , trying to understand the money mistakes people make .
are they saving enough ?
and then count down the days and see what people ended up eating .
well , you still have choice .
and checking the box takes effort .
and last , we talked about loss aversion , and the monkeys and the apples .
mid-sized company in the midwest , blue collar employees struggling to pay their bills repeatedly told us they cannot save more right away .
if you 're thinking about people taking too much risk and not understanding how much risk they 're taking or taking too little risk , we need to think about that .
i want people to understand that design is so much more than cute chairs , that it is first and foremost everything that is around us in our life .
we were talking about the rapture ? it 's coming .
we were talking about dancing ponies , but i was really jealous of the walker arts center for putting up this festival , because it 's very , very wonderful .
and in order to explain interaction , we need to really bring people in and make them realize how interaction is part of their lives .
of course , there are games that are even more educational .
and to this day , i am ambivalent , but when you have instead games like flow , there 's no doubt .
but the spatial evolution in video games is extremely important .
i would like to acquire it , but without owning it .
there are tons of places to go , online and off , if what you want to find is the latest bit of news about just how quickly our hell-bound handbasket is moving .
simple technologies , like wall-mounted devices that display how much power your household is using , and what kind of results you 'll get if you turn off a few lights -- these can actually have a direct positive impact on your energy footprint .
pervasive , always-on networks , high quality sound and video , even devices made to be worn instead of carried in the pocket , will transform how we live on a scale that few really appreciate .
the key components are already widely available .
developers around the world have come up with an amazing variety of ways to layer useful data on top of the maps , from bus routes and crime statistics to the global progress of avian flu .
so -- so with that in mind , i 'm going to set about trying to do those things here , and talk about dying in the 21st century .
i kind of woke up to this bit in the late ' 90s when i met this guy .
and only one in 500 of them had plan about what to do if they became seriously ill .
the death of little nell and cordelia and all that sort of stuff just doesn 't happen anymore .
anyway , we had a major cultural issue .
that 's a really important question to ask people , because giving people the control over who that is produces an amazing outcome .
i think we should be looking at stopping the want for euthanasia , not for making it illegal or legal or worrying about it at all .
marketing reduces things . marketing simplifies .
and do not be disturbed any more by the other aggressive sound .
anyway , in this same kind of approach , i designed k.
i just do that to make money .
and you follow the treatment like that , to the end of the treatment .
and the idea was to create some self-moving benches in the main exhibition room .
andrea is a living air filter that absorbs toxic gasses from air , contaminated indoor air .
but here , unlike andrea , here are supposed to be eaten .
but it was important to create a perfect place , so i tried to , in order to work and create .
the debate is over the proposition : " what the world needs now is nuclear energy . " true or false ?
but we move to cities , toward the bright lights , and one of the things that is there that we want , besides jobs , is electricity .
in places like denmark and germany , they 've maxed out on wind already .
they 're referred to as nuclear batteries .
the low estimate is the nuclear energy industry estimate of nuclear .
if you go to nuclear , you do get a big reduction , but it 's not as much as with wind and concentrated solar .
and you have the uranium mining that you have to deal with .
if you use wind , you guarantee ice will last .
so the other thing is , we don 't need nuclear energy .
the propaganda from the industry has been very , very strong .
and , ultimately , the arithmetic problem isn 't going to go away .
none of those things were stirring .
all those in favor , raise your hands .
i mean , satellite imagery is pretty amazing stuff .
in the late 1990s , a couple of professors proposed a concept for radically reducing the price of putting things in space .
traditional imaging satellites use a line scanner , similar to a xerox machine , and as they traverse the earth , they take pictures , scanning row by row by row to build the complete image .
i want everybody to put out your hands like this for me , first of all .
now earlier on , as part of a tv show that i have coming up on mtv , i attempted to give a similar demonstration of what is now known as second sight .
kb : second sight is whereby a mind-control expert can see through somebody else 's eyes .
kb : what ?
the girl , i 'd never met before , all right .
kb : nicole , and ?
ok , now , i want you to be aware of all the different sensations around you , because we 're going to try a voodoo experiment right now .
i never touched you .
ok , now , in a moment , you 'll feel a certain pressure , ok , and i want you to be aware of the pressure .
only when you want the pressure released , we 'll try it again .
she 's not taking any chances .
i want you to imagine all the negative energy from that broken relationship , from that guy , being imparted into the broken piece of glass , which will represent him , ok .
there 's a k in his name , there is a k.
i 've got four wooden plinths here , steve .
now , steve , look back .
kb : ok , where are you ? put out your hand .
kb : ok . do you think it 's here , yes or no ?
thank you .
there are only four periods in the last 500 years where media has changed enough to qualify for the label " revolution . "
that 's one of the big changes .
the bbc got their first wind of the chinese quake from twitter .
but these are people who have been radicalized , because , thanks to the one child policy , they have lost everyone in their next generation .
and here is the twentieth century answer .
and then , this time last year , obama announced that he was going to change his vote on fisa , the foreign intelligence surveillance act .
in a world where media is global , social , ubiquitous and cheap , in a world of media where the former audience are now increasingly full participants , in that world , media is less and less often about crafting a single message to be consumed by individuals .
now , if you watch " mad men , " like i do -- it 's a popular tv show in the states -- dr. faye miller does something called psychographics , which first came about in the 1960s , where you create these complex psychological profiles of consumers .
it had been presumed before .
why should i know this ?
so [ as ] susan boyle was saying that , 80,000 live audience sang together .
but actually , they were impressed by my words .
and she claimed to be the general manager of red cross at the chamber of commerce .
and because of selected abortion by families who favored boys to girls , now we have ended up with 30 million more young men than women .
but they died because of all different personal reasons .
we heard about polluted air , polluted water , poisoned food .
and here also people are helping to find missing children .
who is at risk ? people like you .
only less than one percent are adequately treated .
we decided that we needed to put our money where our mouth is .
we made sure that we produced some things ourselves .
this is at the heart institute . the doctors from anywhere can log in .
we form people into groups and make them go into challenges .
that way we 're not going to deal with obsolescence and all those kinds of issues .
i run a design studio in new york .
i can see my work as a job . i do it for money .
just before i left new york i decided i could actually renovate my studio .
and i was pleased to see that he actually wrote the book while he was on sabbatical .
in the beginning , on the first sabbatical , it was rather disastrous .
and mostly also because i realized out of a rem koolhaas presentation to the city of porto , where he talked about a conglomeration of various layers of meaning .
you can take the shape and make typography out of it .
we got 250,000 coins from the central bank , at different darknesses .
and the monkeys in that monkey forest looked , actually , fairly happy .
the girls are brought up to be mothers .
i wanted to become a teacher .
it 's a ceremony . people are enjoying it .
well , while i was in high school , something happened .
there 's a belief among our people that morning brings good news .
and as we speak right now , three million girls in africa are at risk of going through this mutilation .
and they did . they donated land where we built the girls ' school .
one hundred twenty-five girls are creating and achieving their dreams .
the central motif of bharti 's practice is the ready-made store-bought bindi that untold millions of indian women apply to their foreheads , every day , in an act closely associated with the institution of marriage .
he uses scale to more and more spectacular effect , whether on the roof of a temple in singapore , or in his increasingly ambitious installation work , here with 192 functioning sewing machines , fabricating the flags of every member of the united nations .
10 artists , six minutes , i know that was a lot to take in .
in fact , many people told us it was illegal .
we might even call them citizens , because they 've recently risen up to fight against legislative incursion , and the citizens of these networks work together to serve each other in great ways .
there 's so many examples i could have picked , and i selected this one of jon bon jovi . some of you may or may not know that he runs a soup kitchen in new jersey , where he caters to and serves the homeless and particularly homeless veterans .
let me be very clear , and perhaps controversial , that open government is not about transparent government .
we 've heard talk here at ted about people biohacking and hacking their plants with arduino , and mozilla is doing work around the world in getting young people to build websites and make videos .
and exactly six years and three days earlier , on june 20th , 1994 , a ship named the apollo sea sank near dassen island , oiling 10,000 penguins -- half of which died .
the other thing that was so striking was the sheer number of volunteers .
so three of those penguins -- peter , pamela and percy -- wore satellite tags , and the researchers crossed their fingers and hoped that by the time they got back home , the oil would be cleaned up from their islands .
so in a panic , estelle from sanccob called the student and said , " please , you have to make more . "
and truly , to be a part of something so much larger than yourself is the most rewarding experience you can possibly have .
but as a scientist , i 'm interested in a different problem of other minds , and that is the one i 'm going to introduce to you today .
and this picture shows the average activation in a group of what we call typical human adults .
so joshua has a cheese sandwich and he says , " yum yum yum yum yum ! i love cheese sandwiches . "
and he takes this one .
rs : should ivan get in trouble for taking joshua 's sandwich ?
okay . good .
so i 'm going to show you a demo of this .
it 's getting them wrong that is living .
rs : that 's one of the idealistic hopes .
we need to know why people are doing what they 're doing .
it can 't be that important . "
so if i understood the chemistry of trustworthiness , i might help alleviate poverty .
some mad scientist is going to jab your arm with a needle and take four tubes of blood .
and i found i could do it with a nasal inhaler .
in this book , smith argued that we are moral creatures , not because of a top-down reason , but for a bottom-up reason .
we have to find the owner for this . " i said , " yea . "
the victim 's brain releases oxytocin , and you 're opening up your wallet or purse , giving away the money .
we have oxytocin that connects us to others , makes us feel what they feel .
her mother , that 's right .
there you go . that 's connection .
thank you .
which of those parents here in the room might not lie concerning the whereabouts of your son or daughter in an investigation of a killing ?
so when i did the calculations for the lunar data and the solar data at that location on earth at the time of the incident of the shooting , all right , it was well past the end of civil twilight and there was no moon up that night .
we had him stand actually slightly in the street , so closer to the suspect vehicle , the shooter vehicle , than the actual teenagers were , so he stood a few feet from the curb toward the middle of the street .
why did i take the risk ?
none of them thought they couldn 't see the person 's face .
they give off a lot of heat into the atmosphere , and for some of you may understand the heat island effect in cities , where the urban areas are much more warm than the adjacent rural areas , but we also have problems that , when we lose power , we can 't open a window here , and so the buildings are uninhabitable and have to be made vacant until that air conditioning system can start up again .
it 's still with that glass box because we still want that visual access , but now it 's sheathed with this thermo-bimetal layer , it 's a screen that goes around it , and that layer can actually open and close as that sun moves around on that surface .
and many more worldwide who are blind or are facing blindness due to diseases of the retina , diseases like macular degeneration , and there 's little that can be done for them .
and so the encoder does just what i was saying : it mimics the actions of the front-end circuitry -- so it takes images in and converts them into the retina 's code .
so what we did is we took a moment in time from these recordings and asked , what was the retina seeing at that moment ?
you might enjoy the awkwardly tight , cut-off pajama bottoms with balloons .
blog posts , photographs , thoughts , feelings , opinions , all of these things were being expressed by people online , and leaving behind trails .
so the next movement is called mobs .
and recently , i 've become interested in diving much more deeply into a single story .
stories take place in a certain area . they have contexts .
and any of these can be clicked , and then the narrative is entered at that position .
it 's baleen . moving on .
he was getting started early . those were his hands .
a 24-year-old truck driver .
his wish was to make some money and open a store .
ah , because you know , it 's impermanent .
i have a friend in portugal whose grandfather built a vehicle out of a bicycle and a washing machine so he could transport his family .
so i 'm a social scientist by training , so why am i here today talking about smart materials ?
jordan then published his results online , including all the things he had tried and didn 't work , so others could study and reproduce it .
thank you .
and perception underpins everything we think , we know , we believe , our hopes , our dreams , the clothes we wear , falling in love , everything begins with perception .
play is one of the only human endeavors where uncertainty is actually celebrated . uncertainty is what makes play fun .
so amy 's going to help me tell the story of what we call the blackawton bees project , and first she 's going to tell you the question that they came up with . so go ahead , amy .
" can you help me , henry ? " what good scientist says that , right ?
the first author is blackawton primary school , because if it were ever referenced , it would be " blackawton et al , " and not one individual . so we submit it to a public access journal , and it says this . it said many things , but it said this .
what you guys have done is real , true and amazing .
thank you very much .
i 'm 43 years old right now .
people who were inspired to go down to the streets and to raise their voices , they tried to kill .
we put it in every sitting room in the arab world -- and internationally , globally , through our english channel .
be aware of these people who [ are ] coming to you in order to ruin your great civilization . "
let us free ourselves -- especially in the west -- from thinking about that part of the world based on oil interest , or based on interests of the illusion of stability and security .
it is not something that you only cover because you have to cover a great incident .
thank you for inspiring them and for inspiring all of us .
we fought very hard against the dictatorship , in a moment it was necessary to us : either go into clandestinity with weapons in hand , or leave brazil . we were too young , and our organization thought it was better for us to go out , and we went to france , where i did a phd in economics , léila became an architect .
what happened is , you saw so many deaths that you are dying .
we started to plant hundreds of thousands of trees , only local species , only native species , where we built an ecosystem identical to the one that was destroyed , and the life started to come back in an incredible way .
this is what we must fight hard to hold like it is now .
me , one minute , it 's dry . the same with the trees .
we here inside the room , i believe that we have the same concern , and the model that we created in brazil , we can transplant it here .
think about the infrastructure to build it .
the innovation of the terrorist operations center gave terrorists unparalleled situational awareness and tactical advantage over the police and over the government .
think about what happened .
there are other avenues of technology that criminals can exploit .
but as these get bigger in the future , what other items will you be able to print ?
it 's a great challenge for them .
personalized cancer treatments are the flip side of personalized bioweapons , which means you can attack any one individual , including all the people in this picture .
or what if we sent it out to a few thousand ?
they call for a shift to a more open form and a more participatory form of law enforcement .
you can 't open yourself to new experiences , new people , new ways of doing things -- they might take you off course .
this becomes your mission . that is all you do .
i venture there are many in this room .
they told her she couldn 't love her vagina in high school , that it was not a legal thing , that it was not a moral thing , that it was not a good thing .
real security is contemplating death , not pretending it doesn 't exist .
on a typical day , do you wake up with hope or gloom ?
wipe it up , throw it away .
and so , like many people , we start with a house on a lot , and i 'm going to show you a typical construction on the top and what we 're doing on the bottom .
but before we pat ourselves too much on the back , we have poured 151 megawatt hours of energy into constructing this house when there was a house there before .
cc : a-rhythm a-rhythm . audience : a-rhythm a-rhythm .
now let 's take those three groups of four and make them four groups of three .
so i want to take the second line beat and the swing beat and put them together , and it sounds something like this .
we have a brain for one reason and one reason only , and that 's to produce adaptable and complex movements .
think about the game of chess .
now if you want this robot to do a different task , that 's another three-year ph.d. program .
similarly , when you put motor output on movement output , it 's extremely noisy .
and numbers in between give you the gray levels of uncertainty .
so it 's the optimal way of combining information .
imagine , as i shake the ketchup bottle , someone very kindly comes up to me and taps it on the back for me .
and here i 've taken away the robots , but basically people move with their right arm sinusoidally back and forward .
and we hypothesize based on the tickling study that when one child hits another , they generate the movement command .
and what we see in all pairs of subjects is this -- a 70 percent escalation in force on each go .
if these dots were cars going on a racing circuit , you would have absolutely no idea what 's going on .
and the fundamental idea is you want to plan your movements so as to minimize the negative consequence of the noise .
you have to study vision with the realization of how the movement system is going to use vision .
so here is what we did . we put a 10-cent digital transponder , a data tag , in the appliance plug .
thank you .
so when this machine breaks , the machines they have to work with break , they 've got to try and figure it out , but most of the time , that 's the end of the road .
but the nurse is literally running around a darkened operating theater trying to find anything she can use to anesthetize her patient , to keep her patient asleep .
essentially , to deliver anesthesia , you want as pure oxygen as possible , because eventually you 're going to dilute it essentially with the gas .
and you do not need to be a highly trained , specialized anesthesiologist to use this machine , which is good because , in these rural district hospitals , you 're not going to get that level of training .
we 're then able to compare the results from that study with real world experience , because we 're putting two of these in hospitals that johns hopkins works with in sierra leone , including the hospital where that emergency c-section happened .
these effects were all unanticipated , and yet we 're discovering they 're predictable .
i don 't know about this , but this is what i can decipher from this diagram in 24 seconds .
it 's a " feel the fear and do it anyway " kind of thing .
so i 've been asked by the organizers to read from my book .
we can see here he started out with orange , and then he already ran out of orange , and here we can see he decided to take a break for a square .
with this method mr. miro could have saved canvas for another picture .
but in the tidied up version , it 's plain to see that it 's a sunburnt woman playing volleyball .
and i think the whole thing adds up much better if you do it like this .
and it 's not done , as many people imagine , with the computer , otherwise it would look like this .
yeah , maybe you 're asking yourselves where old bruegel 's people went ?
so i went onto twitter , and i asked some people if they could explain to me " cala a boca , galvao . "
and in fact , were so successful at this that it topped twitter for two weeks .
and you tend to find topics that are almost entirely african-american conversations .
he 's totally wrong about this one .
it 's extremely lumpy .
and a couple of other countries which we 've invaded .
so here 's the good news .
so a very , very small program designed to get people in front of computers , publishing their own thoughts , publishing independent media , ended up having a huge impact on what we know about this country .
so even if we can find a way to translate from chinese , there 's no guarantee that we 're going to find it .
i know amira .
so if i found myself in the nfl , i suspect i would spend my off-season nursing my wounds , enjoying my house , so on and so forth -- possibly recording a hip-hop album .
we need to look at ways of creating serendipity , of making translation pervasive , and we need to find ways to embrace and celebrate these bridge figures .
there were all the parents sitting in a parking lot eating food out of the back of their car -- only the english -- eating their sausages . they loved their sausages .
we started off as a teeny , teeny little one-celled amoeba , tiny , just sticking onto a rock , and now , voila , the brain .
thank you . anyway , we would fill up with our own adrenaline and our own cortisol , and then we 'd kill or be killed , we 'd eat or we 'd be eaten , and then suddenly we 'd de-fuel , and we 'd go back to normal . okay .
the background radiation is simply too static to be able to be seen under the normal spectral analysis .
that 's something you live inside of every day .
so that 's what i spend my time doing . i 'd like to start , if it 's possible , with a test , because i do business stuff , so it 's important that we focus on outcomes .
you probably — no , you didn 't . okay .
that 's not the important point . the thing you have to remember is , these are eminent economists , some of the smartest people on the planet . do you see the challenge ?
size and scale are no longer the same .
what 's happened in this world of pipe is somebody has flipped it . they 've changed the rules from laminar to turbulent .
so we learned the answer and we carried this in our heads for 20 , 30 years , are you with me ?
the relations between the iranian and the jewish people throughout history has actually been quite positive , starting in 539 b.c. , when king cyrus the great of persia liberated the jewish people from their babylonian captivity .
without iraq balancing iran , iran could now become a threat , some in israel argued .
the ebbs and flows of hostility have not shifted with ideological zeal , but rather with changes in the geopolitical landscape .
and that means that your microbial hitchhikers are moving with you .
you 've heard about the vaccine we 're stockpiling .
we have seen human-to-human transmission in at least three clusters -- fortunately involving very intimate contact , still not putting the world at large at any kind of risk .
the government says the federal responsibility will basically be about trying to keep the virus out , which we all know is impossible , and then to mitigate the impact primarily on our economy .
but what about the no-brainer things ? should we close all the schools ?
we don 't actually have a standard for what should be the protective gear for the first responders , the people who will actually be there on the front lines .
in some cases all schools , all churches , all public venues were closed .
how many masks do you need ?
otherwise you 're in trouble .
and i don 't know that there is any way responsibly for someone to start medicating their children with their personal supply of lipitor or something of that nature .
what percentage of infected people were killed by it ?
and it 's not a pneumonia that would respond to a vaccine .
and he proposed this machine called the memex .
but spin on to the 80s when personal computers did arrive , then there was room for this kind of system on personal computers .
but he was completely convinced that his world wide web would take over the world one day .
and so it makes you wonder , what would happen if we hadn 't tasted the fruit of knowledge , so to speak , and what kind of morality would we have ?
so my whole picture of the animal kingdom , and including humans also , started to change at that time .
otherwise they wouldn 't be pulling so hard .
and so what we did in that case -- we do these studies in thailand for josh plotnik -- is we have an apparatus around which there is a rope , a single rope .
now look at the other . the other doesn 't forget to eat , of course .
it activates the same areas in the brain .
and so that 's how they live .
but what we find is that they prefer the pro-social token .
now if you give the partner grapes -- the food preferences of my capuchin monkeys correspond exactly with the prices in the supermarket -- and so if you give them grapes -- it 's a far better food -- then you create inequity between them .
this study became very famous and we got a lot of comments , especially anthropologists , economists , philosophers .
[ ... in the dark ] so what is the difference , then , between the way i believe science is pursued and the way it seems to be perceived ?
it is true that her papers are , to this day , stored in a basement room in the bibliothèque française in a concrete room that 's lead-lined , and if you 're a scholar and you want access to these notebooks , you have to put on a full radiation hazmat suit , so it 's pretty scary business .
and indeed , the scientific literature grows at an alarming rate .
another popular model is that science is busy unraveling things the way you unravel the peels of an onion .
scientists argue about this all the time .
so yes , you do need to know a lot of stuff as a scientist , but the purpose of knowing a lot of stuff is not just to know a lot of stuff . that just makes you a geek , right ?
a hundred years of robotics , and we can 't get a robot that can move more than a couple steps one way or the other .
so this is a favorite quote of mine that takes us back to the ignorance and the idea of questions .
so we have this remarkably efficient system for beating any interest in science out of everybody 's head .
that 's the one i like in particular .
by understanding that the atmosphere is made out of several different layers of wind which all have different direction .
of course not just like the atmosphere in the balloon , but in life itself .
we fly twice the speed you predicted . "
that 's the moment when you have to motivate your inner potential , your creativity .
and this is when the project solar impulse really started to turn in my head .
that 's for sure .
the same time we load the batteries , we run the engines , and when we get at the maximum height , we arrive at the beginning of the night .
and this is possible . you know , with the technologies we have today , we can save between 30 and 50 percent of the energy of a country in europe , and we can solve half of the rest with renewables .
that 's pretty good , but why not get rid of the wires ?
but think about where the world is today .
the problem is , you get into the city and you want to go four blocks , it 's neither fun nor efficient nor productive .
what if it would make it a little bit more palatable to have access via this , as that last link to mass transit , to get out to your cars so we can all live in the suburbs and use our cars the way we want , and then have our cities energized again ?
and what was i -- you know , how are you going to say anything ?
they start at the top of the technology food chain .
it doesn 't matter much -- it says if you get 200 watts of electricity , you 'll get 700 or 800 watts of heat .
the higgs boson does not share the beauty , the symmetry , the elegance , of the rest of the elementary particle world .
by studying the higgs theory , theoretical physicists discovered , not through an experiment but with the power of mathematics , that the higgs field does not necessarily exist only in the form that we observe today .
and the crucial ingredient necessary to answer this question is the higgs boson mass .
we think that this these " why " questions can give us clues about the fundamental principles of nature .
there was a time in my life when everything seemed perfect .
from my family looking in from outside , what they 're trying to figure out is a different kind of existential question , which is , how far is it going to be possible to bridge from the comatose potential mind that they 're looking at to an actual mind , which i define simply as the functioning of the brain that is remaining inside my head .
until it was stripped from me , i never thought about it .
we 're talking about a society that is retreating into depression and disassociation when we are potentially confronting the next great catastrophic climate shift .
it requires a laboratory to see it in three dimension , but in two dimensions i think you can see the beautiful symmetry and illumination of a normal mind at work .
and then i creep up to the point that i get a score of 79 , which is just below average .
but that person could be identified as having a learning disability .
that 's basically it .
it has been simulated and tested to endure in the body corrosion-free for over 80 years .
i believe that we can all rise and shine .
and it works . it works .
the audience is too small .
so we came together in this design institute called the interaction design institute ivrea , which was teaching interaction design , this idea that you can take design from the simple shape of an object and you can move it forward to design the way you interact with things .
or , the software is gpl , so it 's open-source as well .
mb : check this out .
he has 280,000 followers .
there 's a giant maze , and joey 's sitting there , and the maze is moving when you tilt the tablet .
mb : no .
and what i hope to show is that unpicking dodgy claims , unpicking the evidence behind dodgy claims , isn 't a kind of nasty carping activity ; it 's socially useful , but it 's also an extremely valuable explanatory tool .
she also boasts that she 's a certified professional member of the american association of nutritional consultants , which sounds very glamorous and exciting .
and they very helpfully tell you how to go and find the paper .
so this is what they were going to do in their trial .
so we know that our beliefs and expectations can be manipulated , which is why we do trials where we control against a placebo -- where one half of the people get the real treatment and the other half get placebo .
again , not an insane dose , not an illegal dose , but very much at the high end of normal .
so they all cluster together .
around half of all of the trial data on antidepressants has been withheld , but it goes way beyond that .
in the past several days , i heard people talking about china .
but china also has a great firewall .
sometimes this chinese national internet policy is very simple : block and clone .
2011 , in july , two [ unclear ] trains crashed , in wenzhou , a southern city .
it 's the same content . one , you can see exactly one chinese tweet is equal to 3.5 english tweets .
people just use their cell phones to tweet .
that means from the very beginning , weibo has already convinced the chinese government , we will not become the stage for any kind of a threat to the regime .
but if you dare to retweet or mention any fake coup about beijing , you definitely will be arrested .
there is not only in china , but also in the united states there are some very small , cute but bad cats .
i 'm in love with the old-growth forest , and i 'm a patriotic american because we have those .
my foot is covering approximately 300 miles of mycelium .
going way out , dark matter conforms to the same mycelial archetype .
all across most land masses .
so , the mycelium becomes saturated with the oil , and then , when we returned six weeks later , all the tarps were removed , all the other piles were dead , dark and stinky .
this is a space-conservative method that uses storm debris -- and we can guarantee that we will have storms every year .
so , encouraged by this , naturally we went to flu viruses .
and then -- a delicate dance between dinner and death -- the mycelium is consumed by the ants , they become mummified , and , boing , a mushroom pops out of their head .
i took several containers -- my wife said , if i could do this , anybody could -- and i ended up growing a seed garden .
we took what we knew about africa , the default device , the mobile phone , as our common denominator , and went from there .
this is the twitter reports for over three days just covering mumbai .
it 's coming from places that you wouldn 't expect .
in 1979 i had a chance to put my footprints on the ocean floor while using this personal submersible called jim .
with every drop of water you drink , every breath you take , you 're connected to the sea .
and as of just this week , last monday , google earth is now whole .
also it 's bad news for us .
there are still some krill in antarctica .
with scientists around the world , i 've been looking at the 99 percent of the ocean that is open to fishing -- and mining , and drilling , and dumping , and whatever -- to search out hope spots , and try to find ways to give them and us a secure future .
we need , maybe , an expedition -- a ted at sea -- that could help figure out the next steps .
the khmer rouge closes the doors to the outside world .
and it was at that time that my mother got word from the commune chief that the vietnamese were actually asking for their citizens to go back to vietnam .
and freedom from persecution from the khmer rouge .
then the allied forces went through his collections and found the paintings and went after the people who sold it to him .
according to his biographer , " he looked as if for the first time he had discovered there was evil in the world . "
i want to suggest that this is true , not just for how we think about things , but how we react to things .
in front of them on a screen is information about the wine .
people have murdered those that they loved , believing that they were murdering an imposter .
with my colleagues george newman and gil diesendruck , we 've looked to see what sort of factors , what sort of history , matters for the objects that people like .
they may look alike , but they have a different history .
after being there for three-quarters of an hour , he made 32 dollars .
half of them are told that they 're being given the shocks by somebody in another room , but the person in the other room doesn 't know they 're giving them shocks .
i didn 't read music , but i played synthesizers and drum machines .
and that piece was published , and then i wrote another piece , and that got published .
and it 's in complete silence when i filmed it , because i was only hearing the music in my head , imagining the choir that would one day come to be .
and then we posted this video to youtube about a year and a half ago .
this is beau awtin .
when i placed a marker on the google earth map , i had to go with the nearest city , which is about 400 miles away from where i live .
like many of you here , i am trying to contribute towards a renaissance in africa .
another time , she watched in horror as nurses watched a patient die because they refused to give her oxygen that they had .
why ? because the path i had taken was considered out of bounds .
they wanted us to be analytical .
these things were provided by institutions run by the people that i call leaders .
so i went to look at what was happening in our educational system .
it 's such a simple statement .
it says a lot about her .
thank you , and god bless .
what if we thought of fear as an amazing act of the imagination , something that can be as profound and insightful as storytelling itself ?
now the last option was the longest , and the most difficult : to sail 1,500 miles due south in hopes of reaching a certain band of winds that could eventually push them toward the coast of south america .
in other words , our fears make us think about the future .
i think the end of the story of the whaleship essex offers an illuminating , if tragic , example .
read in the right way , our fears are an amazing gift of the imagination , a kind of everyday clairvoyance , a way of glimpsing what might be the future when there 's still time to influence how that future will play out .
interestingly enough , other neurologic diseases which affect very different parts of the brain also show tangles of misfolded protein , which suggests that the approach might be a general one , and might be used to cure many neurologic diseases , not just alzheimer 's disease .
that 's a lot .
floor : sustainable , recyclable .
here 's a great little example .
it was like vegetable jerky , and killed all of them .
very advanced , no air-conditioning -- i love it .
so i 'm committing to potatoes ; i 'm committing to milk ; i 'm committing to leeks and broccoli -- all very important stuff .
thank you very much .
i 'll begin in 1824 .
it began carrying , among other things , a large number of hunters who began the wholesale killing of buffalo , eliminating a source of food and clothing and shelter for the sioux .
communal ownership of reservation lands ends .
because it was in this moment with the fingers on the triggers of the hotchkiss guns that the u.s. government openly declared its position on native rights .
more than 90 percent of the population lives below the federal poverty line .
and how much of this history do you need to own , even ?
we all , i think , believe in compassion .
you have to , of course , be aware of the needs of others , but you have to be aware in such a way that you can carry on with your life and be of help to people .
all these three things , then , have to be melded together .
because that 's how long they say it takes for this dough to become leaven .
ah , what a wonderful smell . "
and the poor man said , " and you mean god didn 't answer my pleas ? "
i married my high school sweetheart , jane .
i saw new and previously unthinkable possibilities to live and contribute , both for myself and others in my circumstance .
okay , henry , have you been to d.c. lately ?
i grew up in europe , and world war ii caught me when i was between seven and 10 years old .
so my research has been focused more on -- after finding out these things that actually corresponded to my own experience , i tried to understand : where -- in everyday life , in our normal experience -- do we feel really happy ?
and that sounds like a kind of a romantic exaggeration .
this poet describes it as opening a door that floats in the sky -- a very similar description to what albert einstein gave as to how he imagined the forces of relativity , when he was struggling with trying to understand how it worked .
and we can measure this very precisely , actually , because we give people electronic pagers that go off 10 times a day , and whenever they go off you say what you 're doing , how you feel , where you are , what you 're thinking about .
even though sometimes watching television about seven to eight percent of the time is in flow , but that 's when you choose a program you really want to watch and you get feedback from it .
i came up with the idea of painting shadows .
it just would erase my brush strokes like invisible ink .
when i look around this tedxamsterdam venue , i see a very special audience .
let us cherish the fact that probably most of you have never been close to a gun .
the nazis invaded the netherlands .
then in high school , i was gripped by the stories of the allied soldiers -- soldiers who left the safety of their own homes and risked their lives to liberate a country and a people that they didn 't know .
did we simply lose our beastly impulses for revenge , for violent rituals , for pure rage ?
my soldiers use the gun as an instrument of peace .
i hope you will support our soldiers when they are out there , when they come home and when they are injured and need our care .
one , the red line , is the ratio of british to indian per capita income .
in any case , as you may remember , the great divergence reaches its zenith in the 1970s , some considerable time after decolonization .
it 's the institutions .
there are six which i think explain the great divergence .
property rights : it 's not the democracy , folks ; it 's having the rule of law based on private property rights .
that 's the consumer society , and it propels economic growth more than even technological change itself .
not only has japan been ahead for some time , south korea has gone into third place , and china is just about to overtake germany .
he 's now free again , having been detained , as you know , for some time .
i once asked one of my colleagues at harvard , " hey , is south america part of the west ? "
but i do want to talk to you about something that i think is dear to all of us .
a way that is perhaps more real , more honest .
of course we also , particularly in the last decade , managed to envelop the world in a dense chain of supermarkets , in a chain of global trade .
and it frees us all up to do other things -- to sit at ted meetings and not to worry about our food .
what we need to do is to go back to understanding what our food is about .
we cannot just think that small-scale is the solution to the world food problem .
so what can we do ?
we have much cleverer irrigation .
but there is something you must do . it 's not enough for me to say , " let 's get more bold science into agriculture . "
let me share with those of you here in the first row .
every time a young baby learns something new -- to focus its eyes , to mimic a movement or a facial expression , to pick something up , to form a word or to sit up -- new synaptic connections are being built in the brain .
hence they have no option but to implement a regimented program .
behind each of the million children in institutions , there is usually a story of parents who are desperate and feel they 've run out of options , like natalia in moldova , who only had enough money to feed her baby , and so had to send her older son to the institution ; or desi , in bulgaria , who looked after her four children at home until her husband died , but then she had to go out to work full time , and with no support , felt she had no option but to place a child with disabilities in an institution ; or the countless young girls too terrified to tell their parents they 're pregnant , who leave their babies in a hospital ; or the new parents , the young couple who have just found out that their firstborn child has a disability , and instead of being provided with positive messages about their child 's potential , are told by the doctors , " forget her , leave her in the institution , go home and make a healthy one . "
living in new york city , as i do , it 's almost as if , with so many people doing so many things at the same time in such close quarters , it 's almost like life is dealing you extra hands out of that deck .
and one of the side effects of having major massive blood loss is you get tunnel vision , so i remember being on the stretcher and having a little nickel-sized cone of vision , and i was moving my head around and we got to st. vincent 's , and we 're racing down this hallway , and i see the lights going , and it 's a peculiar effect of memories like that .
like , now you can do whatever you want , like , you gotta get on with that .
i mean , even here , yesterday i was walking across the street , and they showed three bishops were executed 500 years ago , right across the street from here .
there could be all sorts of technologies . and one is cell phones .
if you just multiply by 100 million people , let 's say losing one day a month , whatever , and you see a vast amount of resource wasted .
and if we are neighbors , i could just walk over to his house .
so we could do that for telephones .
she typically buys a cow . the cow gives milk .
and it 's serving 52,000 villages , which represent about 80 million people .
i 've been very surprised .
one approach , the one we use mainly , is to look at patients with sustained damage to a small region of the brain , where there 's been a genetic change in a small region of the brain .
now , the most common interpretation of this , which you find in all the psychiatry textbooks , is a freudian view , and that is that this chap -- and the same argument applies to women , by the way , but i 'll just talk about guys .
you can call it the face area of the brain , right ?
this can 't be my mother .
ok , how is all this complex circuitry set up in the brain ?
now , why would a phantom limb be paralyzed ?
maybe you can relieve the phantom pain , the phantom cramp .
he knows it 's a mirror reflection , but it 's a vivid sensory experience .
so , he took it home , and after two weeks , he phones me , and he said , " doctor , you 're not going to believe this . "
so , that 's the bonus .
secondly , synesthesia is about -- and this is what gets me to my point about the main theme of this lecture , which is about creativity -- synesthesia is eight times more common among artists , poets , novelists and other creative people than in the general population .
so , every brain region is wired to every other region , and these are trimmed down to create the characteristic modular architecture of the adult brain .
which one is kiki and which one is buba ?
this conference is going to rank as the most important in the beginning of the 21st century .
and in a way , africa is more than a tragedy , in more ways than one .
let 's take food imports .
even if they had been able to name me 20 , what does that tell you ?
there is the modern sector , there is the informal sector and the traditional sector .
the first one belongs to those ethnic societies who believe that the state was necessarily tyrannous , so they didn 't want to have anything to do with any centralized authority .
they don 't take any orders from their chiefs .
could you please show that ?
you with the sad eyes don 't be discouraged oh , i realize it 's hard to take courage in a world full of people you can lose sight of it all and the darkness inside you can make you feel so small but i see your true colors shining through i see your true colors and that 's why i love you so don 't be afraid to let them show your true colors true colors are beautiful like a rainbow show me a smile , then don 't be unhappy can 't remember when i last saw you laughing if this world makes you crazy and you 've taken all you can bear you can call me up because you know i 'll be there and i 'll see your true colors shining through i see your true colors and that 's why i love you so don 't be afraid to let them show your true colors true colors are beautiful like a rainbow if this world makes you crazy and you 've taken all you can bear you can call me up because you know i 'll be there and i 'll see your true colors shining through i see your true colors and that 's why i love you so don 't be afraid to let them show your true colors true colors are beautiful like a rainbow so don 't be afraid to let them show true colors true colors true colors true colors are beautiful like a rainbow
i think we have an obligation as parents and a society to start teaching our kids to fish instead of giving them the fish -- the old parable : " if you give a man a fish , you feed him for a day .
i just came back from speaking in barcelona at the ypo global conference , and everyone that i met over there who 's an entrepreneur struggled with school .
in managerial accounting , i 'm chapter eight .
and there was about a thousand coat hangers that i 'd collected .
and he said , " i know . "
so not only would he get me one , but i had to get two , and then he wanted me to hire someone to deliver half the papers , which i did , and then i realized that collecting tips was where you made all the money .
and you 'd make these chairs .
so i would sit there with a lawn chair and just carry up all the people who didn 't have caddies .
so i just packaged them . i 'm like 12 , right ?
you know we teach our kids and we buy them games , but why don 't we get them games , if they 're entrepreneurial kids , that kind of nurture the traits that you need to be entrepreneurs ?
the 50 percent that goes in their house account , every six months , goes to the bank .
if you go into a restaurant and you have bad customer service , show them what bad customer service looks like .
i 'm not saying don 't get kids to want to be lawyers .
as i said , he swore too much .
we thought very hard about how to present this unknown subject to a modern audience : the dark colors to set off the colors that remained in objects that were often faded ; the placing of lights to bring out the silk and the gold thread ; the labeling .
in fact , we ripped down the galleries to recreate entirely different settings , a recreation of his first studio , a hall of mirrors , a curiosity box , a sunken ship , a burned-out interior , with videos and soundtracks that ranged from operatic arias to pigs fornicating .
i frequently go out into the hall and the galleries and i watch our visitors coming in .
david deutsch , who 's talking here , in " the fabric of reality , " embraces the " many worlds " interpretation of quantum theory , because the worst that you can say about it is that it 's preposterously wasteful .
as an evolutionary biologist , i 'd say this : our brains have evolved to help us survive within the orders of magnitude of size and speed which our bodies operate at . we never evolved to navigate in the world of atoms .
in the same way , our lives are dominated by gravity but are almost oblivious to the force of surface tension .
if a neutrino had a brain , which it evolved in neutrino-sized ancestors , it would say that rocks really do consist of empty space .
a dog that had never met capric acid would , perhaps , have no more trouble imagining its smell than we would have trouble imagining a trumpet , say , playing one note higher than we 've heard a trumpet play before .
i don 't think we shall have to avail ourselves of that , because i suspect that life is quite common in the universe .

we 're here today to announce the first synthetic cell , a cell made by starting with the digital code in the computer , building the chromosome from four bottles of chemicals , assembling that chromosome in yeast , transplanting it into a recipient bacterial cell and transforming that cell into a new bacterial species .
it was the first dna phage , dna virus , dna genome that was actually sequenced .
and so both sides were progressing , but part of the synthesis had to be accomplished or was able to be accomplished using yeast , putting the fragments in yeast and yeast would assemble these for us .
there 's parts of the genome where it cannot tolerate even a single error , and then there 's parts of the genome where we can put in large blocks of dna , as we did with the watermarks , and it can tolerate all kinds of errors .
so we won 't give the rest of the code , but we will give the three quotations .
because instead of taking weeks to months to make these , dan 's team can now make these in less than 24 hours .

in fact , i use basically the same technology as this 14th-century classroom .
we mostly avoid questions like , " here 's a formula , now tell me the value of y when x is equal to two . "
of course , we couldn 't have a classroom discussion with tens of thousands of students , so we encouraged and nurtured these online forums .

and to be fair , i was desperate for interest and help , and i began to tell him about my strange commentator .
i 'd been diagnosed , drugged and discarded , and was by now so tormented by the voices that i attempted to drill a hole in my head in order to get them out .
throughout all of this , what i would ultimately realize was that each voice was closely related to aspects of myself , and that each of them carried overwhelming emotions that i 'd never had an opportunity to process or resolve , memories of sexual trauma and abuse , of anger , shame , guilt , low self-worth .

because in a world of data deluge and extreme complexity , we believe that experts are more able to process information than we can -- that they are able to come to better conclusions than we could come to on our own .
now there are , of course , exceptions , wonderful , civilization-enhancing exceptions .
you see , being ready to take experts on is about also being willing to dig behind their graphs , their equations , their forecasts , their prophecies , and being armed with the questions to do that -- questions like : what are the assumptions that underpin this ?
best buy , the consumer electronics company , gets all its employees -- the cleaners , the shop assistants , the people in the back office , not just its forecasting team -- to place bets , yes bets , on things like whether or not a product is going to sell well before christmas , on whether customers ' new ideas are going to be or should be taken on by the company , on whether a project will come in on time .

and ultimately , the challenge of the baker , the challenge of every culinary student , of every chef , is to deliver flavor .
okay , we 're going to start with the first stage .
it can be for 20 or 30 minutes . we call that resting or benching .
so basically now we 're eating yeast sweats -- sweat , burps and starch guts .
yes , we slaughter , you know . yes , that 's life .
in stage two , we add water and salt to it , mix it together , and we create something that we call " clay . "
i 've met some dough eaters , but -- it 's not the staff of life , right ? bread is the staff of life .
and -- they -- they 're invented around the same time . i think beer came first .
so this is the sketch of the two states .
you have to imagine the other hand . it 's not there yet .
so when the viewer steps in front of the audience , there will be a response .
so to us , this work also presents its own contradiction .

climate change , ocean acidification , dissolved oxygen , carbon cycle , coastal upwelling , fishing dynamics -- the full spectrum of earth science and ocean science simultaneously in the same volume .
and this is the kind of activity that we can see with high-definition video , because the bandwidth of these cables is so huge that we could have five to 10 stereo hd systems running continuously and , again , directed through robotic techniques from land .
the power generation will come from the ocean itself .
it 's going to be amazing .
a swedish mathematician , von koch , decided that instead of subtracting lines , he would add them .

it 's got all the valves and knobs and things you need to do to inject the right gases at the right time .
also , when you get down there , you find that the water is very , very clear .
so , we 're down there , and this is at 400 feet -- that 's looking straight up , by the way , so you can get a sense of how far away the surface is .
and this is my favorite line from the article .
when we first found it , we weren 't even sure what family this thing belonged to , so we just called it the dr. seuss fish , because it looked like something out of one of those books .

one of the governors of one of the states told me that he didn 't realize that more women were , in fact , literally sitting on the side of the room , which they are , and now he made a rule that all the women on his staff need to sit at the table .
what part of that has surprised you , and perhaps led to a new perspective on your part ?
that it 's not good enough , that it 's not changing quickly enough .
and what we 're learning is how powerful and dynamic these changes can be , that you don 't have to wait very long to see the benefits .
even your sexual organs get more blood flow , so you increase sexual potency .

now , the first issue that we faced was that the dallas theater center had a notoriety that was beyond what you would expect of some place outside of the triumvirate of new york , chicago and seattle .
it was to take all the things that are known as front of house and back of house and redefine them as above house and below house .
one of the things that we learned when we visited various theaters is they hate us architects , because they say the first thing they have to do , the first five minutes of any show , is they have to get our architecture out of the mind of their patron .
there you see it 's the side balconies for the proscenium .
but you also have the ability to allow the audience to see dallas , to perform with dallas as the backdrop of your performance .
we stood outside trying to see if the acoustics worked , and you could see the guys doing this but you couldn 't hear them .
thank you .
this picture is mahatma gandhi in the ' 40s using the exact same setup that we actually use today for diagnosing t.b. in his ashram in sevagram in india .
you pop this in .
you get to see the beam the way it 's projected and bent .
we 've started collecting data for malaria , chagas disease and giardia from patients themselves .
these little green bubbles represent photosynths that users have made .
all right , guys , are you there ?
and while i walk outside , i 'll just mention that here we 're using this for telepresence , but you can equally well use this on the spot , for augmented reality .
so i got involved with this tour , which was for amnesty , and then in ' 88 i took over bono 's job trying to learn how to hustle .
evelyn : he ordered us to sit down , so we sat down .
but this , surely , whoever that man is , whatever he 's done , this is cruel and unusual punishment .
and that 's where i became truly obsessed with this polar realm .
so i 'm very excited to be able to show you those images and a cross-section of my work that i 've done on the polar regions .
and he was so full , he was so happy and so fat eating this seal , that , as i approached him -- about 20 feet away -- to get this picture , his only defense was to keep eating more seal .
and what scientists didn 't predict is that , as this ice melts , these big pockets of black water are forming and they 're grabbing the sun 's energy and accelerating the melting process .
so we had this little communication breakdown .
leopard seals , since the time of shackleton , have had a bad reputation .
all the leopard seal was doing -- it 's just biting a balloon .
and now you 've got to deliver .
so realizing i couldn 't catch swimming penguins , she 'd get these other penguins and bring them slowly towards me , bobbing like this , and she 'd let them go .
and on the last day with this female where i thought i had pushed her too far , i got nervous because she came up to me , she rolled over on her back , and she did this deep , guttural jackhammer sound , this gokgokgokgok .
it 's a norm . it 's a social norm .
the economies of the future depend on that .
people aren 't close or distant .
me was trying not to be an outcome of my violent past , but the separation that had already occurred between me and my body was a pretty significant outcome .
i began to see my body like an ipad or a car .
other women became mad , driven machines like me .
militias were raping six-month-old babies so that countries far away could get access to gold and coltan for their iphones and computers .
in my second chemo , my mother got very sick and i went to see her .
it was the honey in the water that made it sweet , it was the oil that made it sick .
it was a lot of anger , insane humor , a lot of attention , outrage .
and i hold this penny in the palm of my hand , and it 's sticky and rusty , but it feels like i 'm holding a fortune .
he had this shoebox that he carried with him everywhere containing nine comic books , two g.i. joes painted to look like spider-man and five gobots . and this was his treasure .
how 's your genome today ? have you thought about it lately ?
really all you have to know about it is that there 's four letters : a , t , c , g ; they represent the name of a chemical .
in fact , many , many diseases we have struggled with for a long time , like cancer , we haven 't been able to cure because we just don 't understand how it works at the genomic level .
and if you think about the computer industry and how we 've gone from big computers to little ones and how they get more powerful and faster all the time , the same thing is happening with gene sequencing now : we are on the cusp of being able to sequence human genomes for about 5,000 dollars in about an hour or a half-hour ; you will see that happen in the next five years .
you can find out where your relatives come from ; you can do your genealogy going back thousands of years .
the genomic sequence now exists for the entire pinot noir organism , and they identified , once again , about 29,000 genes .
our ocean 's teaming with microbes ; in fact , when craig venter went and sequenced the microbes in the ocean , in the first three months tripled the known species on the planet by discovering all-new microbes in the first 20 feet of water .
and , you know , people would always ask james watson -- he 's not always the most politically correct guy ...
so , carbon dioxide -- the stuff we want to get rid of -- not sugar , not anything .
but we 've been much more reticent , much slower at recognizing this continuity in cognition , in emotion , in consciousness in other animals .
what i wanted to do was give the dolphins choice and control .
i work with a lot of musicians from around the world , and often we don 't have any common language at all , but we sit down behind our instruments , and suddenly there 's a way for us to connect and emote .
he approached me with a vision of doing these things not for people , for animals .
and they share 97 percent of our dna and are incredibly intelligent , so it 's so exciting to think of all the opportunities that we have via technology and the internet to really enrich their lives and open up their world .
and once again , we 've been building great relationships among them just since we 've been rehearsing .
the internet of things tell us that a lot of computer-enabled appliances and devices are going to become part of this system too : appliances that you use around the house , that you use in your office , that you carry around with yourself or in the car .
today . this is the first time you 're talking about it .
all right , well thank you all so much for joining us .
the remnant whale populations were saved by technological innovators and profit-maximizing capitalists .
and one of the worst of these is what it does to our standing in the world if other countries think that everything we do is about oil , if we have to treat countries that have oil differently than countries that don 't have oil .
for example , this opel two-seater does 155 miles an hour at 94 miles a gallon .
so there 's huge leverage for making the car a lot lighter .
because the auto body has only , say , 14 parts , instead of 100 , 150 .
and that doesn 't even count , for example , that available land in the dakotas can cost effectively make enough wind power to run every highway vehicle in the country .
those part inefficient planes are worth more to society dead than alive .
we are the saudi arabia of " nega-barrels . "
who knows , maybe she was volunteering for service .
but what i didn 't anticipate through that rapid transition was the incredible experience of the juxtaposition of my sighted experience up against my unsighted experience of the same places and the same people within such a short period of time .
and i don 't know who 's watching who , but i have a suspicion that a lot of people are watching me .
" god bless you . "
they don 't like it when you drive .
i see it everywhere .
but i don 't engage in serious arguments .
i don 't know how many of you have read it .
so the passivity was culturally projected onto the little girls .
until you read , as i did , an ad in the los angeles times .
but then i read in " dear abby " that that was rude .
and he said that i had to show more respect because it took up to 18 years to learn how to do mime properly .
there the alternative just boggles the imagination .
and then , in economics , there 's an active producer and a passive consumer , which explains why business always has to penetrate new markets .
and the mother says , " oh ! am i driving ? "
i want to say to you richard , in closing , that in ted you 've created a home .
right ?
they all operate the same way . right ?
the system decides you can 't run schools in the summer .
here 's what we know .
people used to say when they 'd come fund us , " geoff , why do you provide these health services ? "
you go on vacation .
i 'm going to make a prediction .
every time something didn 't work , we just threw in the towel and said , " let 's forget it . " right ?
when the safety of america is threatened , we will spend any amount of money .
they 're like , " i really can 't come back . " no . you 'd better stay in school .
[ 6 mile range ] [ top speed near 20mph ] [ uphill climbing ] [ regenerative braking ] so we 're going to show you what this thing can do .
and anyone who 's been bitten by the numbers bug knows that it bites early and it bites deep .
the great descartes said something quite similar .
- 1 = 31 .
word up , l-dog .
these are the largest prime numbers we knew decade by decade , each one dwarfing the one before as computers took over and our power to calculate just grew and grew .
we 're not talking sport today .
first of all , as i explained , to ask a computer " is that number prime ? " to type it in its abbreviated form , and then only about six lines of code is the test for primacy , is a remarkably simple question to ask .
in our beautiful , indigenous sport of australian football , they won the equivalent of the super bowl .
or as my friend descartes might put it , we think , therefore we are .
their uses are quite concentrated .
our mobility fuel goes three-fifths to automobiles .
audi claimed it 's going to beat them both by a year .
and we can use smart it to make traffic free-flowing .
and those twin revolutions in electricity will bring to that sector more numerous and profound and diverse disruptions than any other sector , because we 've got 21st century technology and speed colliding head-on with 20th and 19th century institutions , rules and cultures .
for example , pumps , the biggest use of motors , move liquid through pipes .
that happens to be the same amount of solar cell capacity that the world can now make every year -- a number that goes up 60 or 70 percent a year .
but that blackout risk disappears , and all of the other risks are best managed , with distributed renewables organized into local micro-grids that normally interconnect , but can stand alone at need .
now if you like any of those outcomes , you can support reinventing fire without needing to like all of them and without needing to agree about which of them is most important .
but it was also the largest city that had ever been built .
and so one of the founding moments of public health in the 19th century effectively poisoned the water supply of london much more effectively than any modern day bioterrorist could have ever dreamed of doing .
and eventually snow made a map of the outbreak .
and so that in a way is the ultimate legacy of this map .
and i wanted to give something back in my own way . "
i said , " no , i want to actually start a college only for the poor .
you eat on the floor , you sleep on the floor , you work on the floor .
but then they suspected , they thought there was an architect behind it .
and everything works off the sun for the next 25 years .
because it 's for the convenience of the child ; it 's not for the convenience of the teacher .
you have jokhim chacha who is 300 years old .
telegraph ? no .
he didn 't know .
went to this village .
look for solutions within .
we have all heard about the tremendous human loss in the earthquake in haiti , but we haven 't heard enough about why all those lives were lost .
adjusted for population density , that is less than one percent of the impact of the haitian quake .
ultimately , there are two ways that you can rebuild haiti ; the way at the top is the way that haiti 's been building for decades .
and so valuable resources have to be looked after and guarded in a particular way , and we think the reason they roll the balls away is because of this , because of the competition that is involved in getting hold of that dung .
so a classic experiment here , in that what we did was we moved the sun .
so what are they doing when they do this dance ?
so all we 're interested in here is comparing the temperature of the beetle against the background .
there are 13 species in the genus , and they have a particular behavior that i think you will find interesting .
if it is using something called path integration , it will not find its home . it will arrive at the wrong spot , and what it 's doing here if it 's using path integration is it 's counting its steps or measuring the distance out in this direction .
well , we know that they can roll balls in a straight line using celestial cues .
and even blind babies smile to the sound of the human voice .
the finding supported darwin 's theory by showing that facial feedback modifies the neural processing of emotional content in the brain in a way that helps us feel better when we smile .
she was rushed to hospital , but it was too late . she died .
it 's important because it combines both the heart and the head .
he became an effective altruist when he calculated that with the money that he was likely to earn throughout his career , an academic career , he could give enough to cure 80,000 people of blindness in developing countries and still have enough left for a perfectly adequate standard of living .
many people will think , though , that charities aren 't really all that effective .
possibly research could help us not only to predict the path of asteroids that might collide with us , but actually to deflect them .
this is a picture of him showing him recovering from surgery .
how is it that this can lead to over two million deaths every year ?
and they took the briquettes back to mit so that they could test them .
and in fact , it 's grown all over the world -- yucca , tapioca , manioc , cassava , it 's all the same thing -- a very starchy root vegetable .
and at the same time that we had students in the lab looking at this , we also had community partners in haiti working to develop the process , to improve it and to make it more accessible to people in the villages there .
compared to the sugarcane charcoal , where we actually have to teach people how to form it into briquettes and you have the extra step of cooking the binder , this comes pre-briquetted .
these are the issues that we need to come up with solutions for .
it 's a difficult thing ; it 's a marketplace which is very fragmented and a consumer population with no income .
and by the time a diagnosis was made , she was in a deep spiral .
and what this law did was it mandated that women and minorities be included in clinical trials that were funded by the national institutes of health .
when linda came to us , we did another cardiac catheterization and this time , we found clues .
and what they found out was that of those that were tossed out , 65 percent were excluded because even though women were included in the studies , the analysis didn 't differentiate between women and men .
and what they found was that the genetic mutations that the drug targeted were far more common in women .
we know that these differences are often overlooked .
but i want to begin tonight by suggesting that this urban crisis is not only economic or environmental .
or the garage doors that are brought from san diego in trucks to become the new skin of emergency housing in many of these slums surrounding the edges of tijuana .
they were lucky , they said , because they began to dig under an arm of the freeway that belongs to the local municipality .
i 'm not . i 'm a parent , i 'm a resident and i 'm a teacher .
and you see how attentive these kids are to these seeds .
and what 'd we do then ? well , i met nice people like you , and they invited us to the hamptons .
and then when rockefeller center said , nbc , could you put this thing up on the walls ? we were delighted .
that 's triple bottom line ! okay ?
okay ? and these are my future farmers of america , growing up in brook park on 141st street , the most migrant community in america .
but those kids are the kids who are now putting pumpkin patches on top of trains .
all start overage and under-credit .
people , you can all do that .
i 've got to say thank you to my wife and family , for my kids , thank you for coming every day , and for my colleagues , believing and supporting me .
and to my astonishment , she agreed to let me photograph her granddaughter .
i decided to follow her to school .
the end of the week came and my translator came back , because i 'd asked her to come back , so i could formally thank the grandmother and hyun-sook .
and i said , " the grandmother thinks she 's sick , but i think maybe we would have to bring the grandmother over also . "
she didn 't recognize me -- there was no recognition whatsoever .
i said , " but you know , i bought an airline ticket , and i 'm stuck here for a week . "
i said , " all i know is , i 've been photographing a lot of these children . "
and i always felt that the grandmother had kind of demanded , and insisted , that the villagers treat hyun-sook with the same respect they treated her .
so , my friend gene flew over with his son , tim .
we were just like , you know , ah , just full of ourselves .
and he closes the door , and the whole room is now filled with smoke .
and there was a building , a new building , going up , that was being built right outside , across the street from our hotel .
we drank a lot of rice wine . we were both so drunk , i couldn 't believe it .
this is kylie , her sister , who 's now a doctor , on the right .
the captain of the cheerleaders .
rick smolan : i 'm sure there 's about 40 things she 's going to tell me , " that wasn 't what happened , that wasn 't what you said . "
in fact , the streetlights in 1742 of galway , dublin and waterford were linked with sunfish oil .
and it declined very fast -- a classic boom and bust fishery , which suggests that a stock has been depleted or there 's low reproductive rates .
there 's also moves in europe to try and stop catching them .
i 'll show you what they look like .
all he knows is where he tagged them and he knows where they popped off .
so he did another study using microsatellites , which are much more expensive , much more time consuming , and , to his surprise , came up with almost identical results .
do you remember how many they killed off achill there in the 70s and the 50s ?
and on one occasion when we were up in malin head up in donegal , a shark smacked the side of the boat with his tail , more , i think , in startle to the fact that a boat came near it , rather than the tag going in .
anyway he thought he 'd better do it , because i never met him before and he might lose face if he hadn 't done the thing i sent him .
and you always think you might have some legacy you can leave the world behind .
but for the time being , thank you for that .
what you really want to do is to get to the awesome yet practical part of this space .
jm : now of course , we were thinking , well let 's just first put the data out there for people to do science to it .
well which one should i use ?
in 1700 , in 1800 , in 1900 , no one cared .
but if you want to reach the very top , you should delay gratification and , of course , become a politician .
if the suppression index is very , very , very small , then you very well might be being suppressed .
we have to make this available for people . "
jm : there are many usages of this data , but the bottom line is that the historical record is being digitized .
in the meantime , i was chairing donor meetings , for instance , in which the various donors , and many of them like to be in nairobi -- it is true , it is one of the unsafest cities of the world , but they like to be there because the other cities are even less comfortable .
in germany , foreign bribery was allowed .
and in the first session , they all said , " this is not bribery , what we are doing . " this is customary there .
we are , germany , is not ratifying .
thank you .
and let 's see , you can make the pie and cinnamon and sugar , and then you eat , and you eat , and you eat , and you -- she 's about 300 pounds now .
it 's how they , see , have those album things -- kids don 't know what they are .
this is mek going through a windshield wiper motor .
there 's some kind of a blend that happens that allows , you know , to find innovation .
a little , tiny guy walks along . more servo drives , lots of servo hacking , lots of mechanical stuff .
and then we said , well , you 're going to feed him , and he needs to talk , and it got more complicated .
so she comes to the rescue .
he 'd -- you can tickle him . when i put my hand up , " ha , ha , ha , ha " and that 's how we sold him .
eight months later -- you may remember this , this was a -- total , total , total chaos .
so i picked a camarasaurus , because the camarasaurus was the most abundant of the sauropods in north america .
there 's a photorealistic eye behind a lens .
john sosoka is our cto , and is really the man that 's done most of the work with our 40-person company .
here , here , here . have some money , pleo .
we have one animator who 's taken it and he 's done a take on the budweiser beer commercial , and they 're going , " whassup , " you know ?
this is merely proof of everyone failing to do the right thing .
this was like a biological desert .
and then we apply all these other principles like transparency , professional management , measurable results , scalability , [ unclear ] , etc .
january .
this is what it looks like : the people have to tap them twice a day -- just a millimeter slice -- and the only thing you harvest is sugar water , carbon dioxide , rain fall and a little bit of sunshine .
and we have monitored every single one of those trees from space .
so we lowered air temperature three to five degrees celsius .
so you create a cool place where clouds can accumulate , and you have the trees to initiate the rain .
and after a few years , you can remove some of those shade trees .
good morning . how are you ? it 's been great , hasn 't it ?
and we squander them , pretty ruthlessly .
they just switched , that was it .
do you ? because you don 't think of shakespeare being a child , do you ?
i think math is very important , but so is dance .
the whole system was invented -- around the world , there were no public systems of education , really , before the 19th century .
one , it 's diverse . we think about the world in all the ways that we experience it . we think visually , we think in sound , we think kinesthetically .
anyway , gillian and i had lunch one day and i said , " gillian , how 'd you get to be a dancer ? " and she said it was interesting ; when she was at school , she was really hopeless . and the school , in the ' 30s , wrote to her parents and said , " we think gillian has a learning disorder . " she couldn 't concentrate ; she was fidgeting . i think now they 'd say she had adhd . wouldn 't you ? but this was the 1930s , and adhd hadn 't been invented at this point .
and he 's right .
now , the tapir is a mammal from south america .
if a female gets too many stab wounds , or if a stab wound happens to become infected , she can actually die from it .
a little guppy porn for you right there .
i work with a species called " bonobo . "
they had no stone tools .
and now we see all four .
i have a lighter in my pocket if you need one .
this is her first time to try to drive a golf cart .
the tough hide is difficult to cut , even with a knife .
panbanisha is communicating to dr. sue where she wants to go .
so we want to create an environment in which bonobos , like all of the individuals with whom they are interacting -- we want to create an environment in which they have fun , and an environment in which the others are meaningful individuals for them .
good kanzi . very good . thank you so much .
i 've made him run into a wall here , over and over again .
now , we started working on this a while ago at oxford university , and we tried to start very simply .
i got up the next morning , went to the computer and looked at the results , and was hoping for something that walked in a straight line , like i 've just demonstrated , and this is what i got instead .
now , at this stage , we decided to start a company and move this further , because obviously this was just a very simple , blocky biped .
so here , we 've got the same character .
i haven 't shown this to anybody yet .
what people wanted as a behavior was to have an explosion , a strong force applied to the character , and have the character react to it in midair .
you feel kind of sorry for the guy .
the second thing is video games .
we do have one unintentional dancer actually , the last thing i 'm going to show you .
as luck would have it , six months after we arrived , they too had a military coup .
one man , president robert mugabe , is almost single-handedly responsible for having destroyed this country .
i think the economy needs a stimulus . "
the good news is that most of these leaders have moved on , and they were replaced by generation three .
and she 's just turned 18 .
but one thing has been troubling me .
the little things in life , sometimes that we forget about , like pollination , that we take for granted .
" well , why ? "
of course , there are the bases , which refer to specific sexual activities that happen in a very specific order , ultimately resulting in scoring a run or hitting a home run , which is usually having vaginal intercourse to the point of orgasm , at least for the guy .
it 's not exactly your choice .
and then when we get together with someone for pizza , we 're not competing with them , we 're looking for an experience that both of us will share that 's satisfying for both of us , and when you get together for pizza with somebody , what 's the first thing you do ?
there 's a million different toppings .
they 're all exclamation points .
every year when it comes to the cotton harvest , the government shuts down the schools , puts the kids in buses , buses them to the cotton fields to spend three weeks harvesting the cotton .
you 've seen the documentaries of sweatshops making garments all over the world , even in developed countries .
in fact , about 80 percent of the active ingredients in medicines now come from offshore , particularly china and india , and we don 't have a governance system .
so they formed a white house task force , and they spent about three years arguing about who takes how much responsibility in the global supply chain .
but they are extremely efficient organizations .
so what we 're doing is , we 're not only enlisting the multinationals , we 're giving them the tools to deliver this public good -- respect for human rights -- and we 're checking .
that 's what we 're trying to provide .
please ask them to treat us like human beings . "
the second one is , how do you go to the loo at minus 40 ?
you can see two ski poles sticking out of the roof of the tent .
in a huge amount of debt personally to this expedition , and lying on my mum 's sofa , day in day out , watching daytime tv .
finally , morning of day 11 , we got the all-clear , loaded up the helicopters -- two helicopters flying in tandem -- dropped me off at the edge of the pack ice .
the weather is just appalling -- oh , drifted back about five miles in the last -- last night .
it wasn 't all high-tech . this is navigating in what 's called a whiteout .
and i got three voicemails .
it just about worked . a pretty dramatic landing -- the plane actually passed over four times , and i was a bit worried it wasn 't going to land at all .
and only from the air did i see the big picture .
and there 's a race to get to the pole between amundsen , the norwegian -- amundsen had dog sleds and huskies -- and scott , the british guy , captain scott .
i had never seen an internet .
because of the hunger , i was forced to drop out of school .
i could not get rid of them .
well , under the category of " what 's the harm of silly stuff like this ? "
sometimes it was even spinning around twice counterclockwise , once clockwise and peck the key twice .
this is the only equation in the talk by the way .
planet saturn . yes , that 's good .
a similar experiment was done by another [ swiss ] psychologist named peter brugger , who found significantly more meaningful patterns were perceived on the right hemisphere , via the left visual field , than the left hemisphere .
if it 's too low , you 're more likely to make too many type ii errors .
and of course , the ambiguous figures that seem to flip-flop back and forth .
so what you 're doing is comparing that angle instead of with this one , but with that one .
is it just the wind or a dangerous predator ?
so we can 't just uniformly dismiss all patterns like that .
and you get a sense of out-of-body experience .
now , what i 'm going to be looking for in this test is how it protects your lips , the texture , right , and maybe if you can discern any flavor or not .
but ice has another meaning .
when i realized that climate change was real , and it was not based on computer models , i decided that one day i would do a project looking at trying to manifest climate change photographically .
there 's a lot of people working on this right now .
that 's the natural cycle .
the calving face is the wall where the visible ice breaks off , but in fact , it goes down below sea level another couple thousand feet .
and you see where it ended in these various spring days , june , may , then october .
and here , if you watch , you can see the terminus retreating .
so , imagine how big this is and how much ice is charging out .
now i 've come to the conclusion after spending a lot of time in this climate change world that we don 't have a problem of economics , technology and public policy .
ok now , more importantly , had we been there in the ' 40s and ' 50s , ' 60s , had we seen this disease , had we understood exactly what was going on with it , how might that have changed and completely transformed the nature of the way this pandemic moved ?
we give them these little pieces of filter paper .
nw : ok , before i continue , i think it 's important to take just a moment to talk about bush meat . bush meat is the hunting of wild game .
you know , i looked at the map ; i picked out 17 sites ; i figured , no problem .
this was our laboratory before .
so it 's not just hunters in central africa .
now , i must tell you that this was never a very popular argument , and it 's probably not very popular yet with some of you sitting in this audience .
why are they engaging with cyberspace ?
this is what political scientists call authoritarian deliberation , and it happens when governments are actually reaching out to their critics and letting them engage with each other online .
just to give you an example from iran , we all heard about the twitter revolution that happened there , but if you look close enough , you 'll actually see that many of the networks and blogs and twitter and facebook were actually operational .
so what should we do about it ?
my mother was like the woman in tom and jerry .
and i sliced the little splinters of wood with a broken shard of glass , constructed this little apartment .
now that is called the huf haus .
so what i did , like i said , come back to the glass .
and i decided to build it up .
can anybody see the blade on the end of that needle ?
and they go " meow ! ow ! "
in america they say a period stop .
there 's no way a man can do that .
it 's -- i had to make little holes in the base of the needle , to shove his feet in .
and the pinhead i 've made green around there by scraping the particles off a green shirt and then pressed onto the needle .
we found remains of giant predatory dinosaurs , medium-sized predatory dinosaurs , and seven or eight different kinds of crocodile-like hunters .
so that 's really what makes this an incredible discovery .
and of course , the government official said , " of course you have to have a handrail . "
so it means basically this architecture is a roof .
we can go skiing in -20 degrees in winter .
the building is only five meters tall with seven floors .
and these children have the highest athletic abilities among many kindergartens .
i come from a humble family , and two weeks before the deadline to apply to mit , i started the application process .
maybe if i did little , a couple hundred thousand people would read it , and that 's great already .
you could see that they were sweating and this was tough .
when i was a kid , the disaster we worried about most was a nuclear war .
now , médecins sans frontières did a great job orchestrating volunteers .
and by the time you 're contagious , most people are so sick that they 're bedridden .

and then , on top of that , the chinese to this day believe that the united states and the west do not accept the legitimacy of their political system because it 's so radically different from those of us who come from liberal democracies , and believe that the united states to this day is seeking to undermine their political system .
be realistic about the things that we disagree on , and a management approach that doesn 't enable any one of those differences to break into war or conflict until we 've acquired the diplomatic skills to solve them .
but the day after the apology , what happened ?
but no , look , for all of us who are friends of these two great countries , america and china , you can do something .
and i love england , my adopted country , with a passion that perhaps only someone who has lost their human rights can feel .

let me share with you two secrets of success : surround yourself with first-class people and people that you like ; and choose your partner very , very carefully .

there 's a hospice doctor named ira byock who has worked closely with us on recording interviews with people who are dying .

thank you . thank you .
so in other words , collectively as a society , we 're very much blind , because our smartest machines are still blind .

about four months ago , we finally tied all this together and produced one of the first computer vision models that is capable of generating a human-like sentence when it sees a picture for the first time .

this is a job for a 3d printer , but most 3d printers would take between three and 10 hours to fabricate it , and we 're going to take the risk tonight to try to fabricate it onstage during this 10-minute talk .

l.a. muscle magazine warned its readers that 40 to 50 percent of women suffer from pms , and that it plays a major role in women 's mental and physical health , and a couple of years ago , even the wall street journal ran an article on calcium as a treatment for pms , asking its female readers , " do you turn into a witch every month ? "
to do reliable research on any condition , scientists must agree on the specific characteristics that make up that condition so they 're all talking about the same thing , and with pms , this has not been the case .
and she says yes , but then , when you have her keep a daily log of psychological symptoms for two months , no correlation is found between her symptoms and time of the month .
so we have not had that at all with these so-called treatments .
sweeping emotions under the rug of pms keeps women from understanding the source of their negative emotions , but it also takes away the opportunity to take any action to change them .
this is why i am here today with you .
that candle would burn for 15 minutes , 15 minutes of precious light , and then they would take it away , and i returned to darkness .

they also learn how to advocate for their point of view .
the head of the engineering group and the infrastructure group at that time was a man named bill coughran .
they know how to do collaborative problem solving , they know how to do discovery-driven learning and they know how to do integrated decision making .
what do they focus their time on ?
they 're thinking , " i 'm not the visionary , i 'm the social architect .
because ed , like vineet , understands that our role as leaders is to set the stage , not perform on it .
they 're just normal people .

twenty-five years ago , scientists at cern created the world wide web .
unfortunately , today , when we actually send an email , we 're not sending a letter .
so needless to say , this is not a solution for everybody , and this actually is part of the problem , because if you think about communication , by definition , it involves having someone to communicate with .
so the key challenge is to take bob 's message and to get it to alice in such a way that the server cannot read that message .
right now , we have a quarter of a million people that have signed up for protonmail , and these people come from everywhere , and this really shows that privacy is not just an american or a european issue , it 's a global issue that impacts all of us .

there was cell phone service way out in the middle of nowhere .
they 're full of sensors .
this is the moment where we 've actually arrived close to where the loggers are .

my wife fernanda doesn 't like the term , but a lot of people in my family died of melanoma cancer and my parents and grandparents had it .

they draw a loaf of bread , which is sliced , then put into a toaster .
what 's interesting about these systems models is how they reveal our various points of view .
the drawings are much richer .

the reason that lofa county is so important is because about five months ago , when the epidemic was just starting to escalate , lofa county was right at the center , the epicenter of this epidemic .
and ladies and gentlemen , what happened then was rather extraordinary : the community and the health workers , peter , they sat down together and they put together a new plan for controlling ebola in lofa county .
by the middle of the year , not just guinea but now sierra leone and liberia were also infected .
not only did this virus continue in the places where they 'd already become infected , but then it started to escalate and we saw the case numbers that you see here , something we 'd never seen before on such a scale , an exponential increase of ebola cases not just in these countries or the areas already infected in these countries but also spreading further and deeper into these countries .
there are four things that are critical to stopping ebola .
we saw militaries from within those countries and from far beyond coming in to help build ebola treatment centers that could be used to isolate those who were sick .
they want to drive ebola to zero in their countries .
one frustrated journalist could not take this anymore .
nowadays , a network of tweets can unleash a global awareness campaign .
it was one of the largest global protests ever organized .

so this is just one experiment that we published a few years ago , where a monkey , without moving its body , learned to control the movements of an avatar arm , a virtual arm that doesn 't exist .
because a couple years after brazil was awarded the world cup , we heard that the brazilian government wanted to do something meaningful in the opening ceremony in the country that reinvented and perfected soccer until we met the germans , of course .
of course , he will have it whenever he wants .
one monkey is controlling the x dimension , the other monkey is controlling the y dimension .
but each monkey is only getting the two dimensions on the video screen that the monkey controls .
and he was able to verbally indicate what was the message the first subject was sending through the internet across continents .
so this jumping mechanism is about four millimeters on a side , so really tiny .
but ultimately we want to add everything onboard the robot .
thanks very much .
i think it 's fragile cities which will define the future of order and disorder .
now , if violence is re-concentrating geographically , it 's also being reconfigured to the world 's new topography , because when it comes to cities , the world ain 't flat , like thomas friedman likes to say .

let 's first go to china , where the country 's largest i.t. service provider , neusoft , has developed a telemedicine solution to help doctors in cities remotely treat old and poor patients in chinese villages .
in california , where i live , water scarcity is becoming a big problem .
this solution was initially designed for the chinese market , but now it 's selling like hotcakes in the u.s. and europe , where hospitals are pressured to deliver quality care at lower cost .
ultimately , we would like to see developed countries and developing countries come together and co-create frugal solutions that benefit the entire humanity .
companies tend to scale up vertically by centralizing operations in big factories and warehouses , but if you want to be agile and deal with immense customer diversity , you need to scale out horizontally using a distributed supply chain with smaller manufacturing and distribution units , like grameen bank has shown .
three quarters of that is in the temperate zone , and just one quarter is in the tropics , but this one quarter , one billion hectares , holds most of the biodiversity , and very importantly , 50 percent of the living biomass , the carbon .
so we came up with this plan with 144 actions in different areas .
one may think that when you do these kinds of actions to decrease , to push down deforestation , because you will not have economic activity or something like that .
what happens is that this beetle is controlled by the cold weather in the winter .
you have to choose . you take the airplane or you have a car .
we need to have the courage to actually change the route , think that we can actually change the route .

so let 's talk about equality .
requires laying out in excruciating detail every single step that you want the computer to do in order to achieve your goal .
how did they do this ?
this is much like the way that humans learn .
this algorithm developed out of switzerland by people , none of whom speak or understand any chinese .
but they generated new insightful science .
and when it does so successfully , so here , the computer has successfully found areas , for example , angles .
and at this point , it 's just a case and trying to understand why .
so currently , we see the things around us and we say , " oh , computers are still pretty dumb . " right ?

executives at norway 's national broadcasting service are now considering broadcasting a night of knitting nationwide .
we had four cameras , three of them pointing out to the beautiful nature .
why stop at 436 when you can expand that to 8,040 , minute by minute , and do the iconic journey in norway , the coastal ship journey hurtigruten from bergen to kirkenes , almost 3,000 kilometers , covering most of our coast .
i have some really strong memories from that week , and it 's all about people .
eight wires keep the camera stable .
it looks like this : 3.2 million norwegians watched part of this program , and we are only five million here .
we take the viewer on a journey that happens right now in real time , and the viewer gets the feeling of actually being there , actually being on the train , on the boat , and knitting together with others , and the reason i think why they 're doing that is because we don 't edit the timeline .
so we think that slow tv is one nice way of telling a tv story , and we think that we can continue doing it , not too often , once or twice a year , so we keep the feeling of an event , and we also think that the good slow tv idea , that 's the idea when people say , " oh no , you can 't put that on tv .

the 20th-century french philosopher michel foucault realized that that model could be used that seeks to control human behavior : schools , hospitals , factories , workplaces . and what he said was that this mindset , this framework discovered by bentham , was the key means of societal control for modern , western societies , which no longer need the overt weapons of tyranny — punishing or imprisoning or killing dissidents , or legally compelling loyalty to a particular party — because mass surveillance creates a prison in the mind that is a much more subtle though much more effective means of fostering compliance with social norms or with social orthodoxy , much more effective the most iconic work of literature about surveillance and privacy is the george orwell novel " 1984 , " which we all learn in school , and therefore it 's almost become a cliche .
we can try and render the chains of mass surveillance invisible or undetectable , thank you very much .
people who want to enrich themselves do it secretly by selling secrets to the government , but i think there 's one important point worth making , which is , that accusation comes from people in the u.s. government , from people in the media who are loyalists to these various governments , and i think a lot of times when people make accusations like that about other people — " oh , he can 't really be doing this for principled reasons , he must have some corrupt , nefarious reason " — they 're saying a lot more about themselves than they are the target of their accusations , because — — they themselves never act for any reason other than corrupt reasons , so they assume that everybody else is plagued by the same disease of soullessness as they are , and so that 's the assumption .

my generation has been incredibly good at using new networks and technologies to organize protests , protests that were able to successfully impose agendas , roll back extremely pernicious legislation , and even overthrow authoritarian governments .
so democracyos is about persuading and being persuaded .
we understood that if we wanted to become part of the conversation , to have a seat at the table , we needed to become valid stakeholders , and the only way of doing it is to play by the system rules .
we know a little bit more today than we used to know , but we still know too little , and certainly there are many different processes — economic , social , political — that need to be studied more .
okay , so that 's fact number one , and that 's very important for what follows .
you also have shocks to rates of return .
first , a very low rate of return due to the 1914 and 1945 war shocks , destruction of wealth , inflation , bankruptcy during the great depression , and all of this reduced the private rate of return to wealth to unusually low levels between 1914 and 1945 .
and to some extent , the fight against tax havens and automatic transmission of information is pushing us in this direction .
i think we can make progress if we have a more pragmatic approach to these questions and we have the proper sanctions on those who benefit from financial opacity .
look , the reason why i put all the data online with all of the detailed computation is so that we can have an open and transparent debate about this .
it started a couple of years ago .
and the central idea of this work is that the human mind and brain is not a single , general-purpose processor , but a collection of highly specialized components , each solving a different specific problem , and yet collectively making up who we are as human beings and thinkers .
okay , here 's another one . it 's a brain , of course .
so i got back in the scanner , i looked at more faces and i looked at more objects and i got a similar blob , and then i did it again and i did it again and again and again , and around about then i decided to believe it was for real .
neurologist : okay , just look at my face and tell me what happens when i do this .
so that 's not good . stuff could be hidden in there .
the most amazing region that 's been found yet is this one right here in turquoise .
i mean , it could have been otherwise .
havana 's latin american medical school : it 's the largest medical school in the world , graduating 23,000 young doctors since its first class of 2005 , with nearly 10,000 more in the pipeline .
luther castillo comes from san pedro de tocamacho on the atlantic coast of honduras .
doctors are concentrated in the cities , where only half the world 's people live , and within cities , not in the shantytowns or south l.a.
dozens of projects give us an inkling of what they 're capable of doing .
take a look : 748 haitian graduates by 2012 , when cholera struck , nearly half working in the public health sector but one quarter unemployed , and 110 had left haiti altogether .
she is well trained , can be counted on , and shares the face and culture of her patients , and she deserves our support surely , because whether by subway , mule , or canoe , she is teaching us to walk the walk .
here 's what i mean by that .
much of the advice is emphasizing personal actions that we need to take , like become more assertive , become more confident , develop your personal brand , things that tonya 's been working on , and advice about working with other people , things like learn to self-promote , get a mentor , enhance your network , and virtually nothing said about the importance of business , strategic and financial acumen .
one young scientist that works in a biotech firm used her insight about the missing 33 percent to weave financial impact data into a project update she did and got tremendous positive feedback from the managers in the room .
if , well , i guess you know what i mean .
as you can see , there 's no protective equipment , no protective clothing .
so we can open up all these possibilities if we take away the old paradigm of flush toilets and treatment plants .
habitat would be all about gardens , contact with nature , streets instead of corridors .
we came up with a number of models : economy models , cheaper to build and more compact ; membranes of housing where people could design their own house and create their own gardens .
and that 's all i can tell you in five minutes .
for a moment , all i saw was white , bright white , like these lights .
but when you buy an individual 11-centimeter pie , you can buy the one that you want .
this is how society stored and transmitted information .
so what could we do with this ?
arthur samuel knew something else .
researchers recently have looked at the question of biopsies , cancerous biopsies , and they 've asked the computer to identify by looking at the data and survival rates to determine whether cells are actually cancerous or not , and sure enough , when you throw the data at it , through a machine-learning algorithm , the machine was able to identify the 12 telltale signs that best predict that this biopsy of the breast cancer cells are indeed cancerous .
and that person 's job , as well as an entire fleet of professionals like that person , is going to find that their jobs are radically changed or actually completely eliminated .
apart from dodging the occasional vehicle , it was a safe and easy way to get around .
it means that most countries around the world , rich or poor , are going to be facing that i want to talk about and highlight .
now , the more i 've thought about this , the two transformations coming together , the more i 've come to realize that this is an enormous opportunity .
i had to walk home three miles from school .
i think they 've got a good chance of doing that .
we do understand how to manage those well .
are we going to look our grandchildren in the eye and tell them that we understood the issues , that we recognized the dangers and the opportunities , and still we failed to act ?

and herschel 's recognition that something was different , that something wasn 't quite right , the planet uranus , a name that has entertained countless generations of children , but a planet that overnight doubled the size of our known solar system .
ten supernova per second explode somewhere in our universe .
and if we want to answer that question , we have to know and understand the history of our solar system in detail , and it 's the details that are crucial .
and they showed this by measuring the brightness of supernovae , and how the brightness of the supernovae got fainter with distance .
one roll of the dice would tell you very little , but the more times you rolled them , the more data you collected , the more confident you would become , not just whether they 're loaded or fair , but by how much , and in what way .

now how did you do ?
they still are confined to terrible , terrible limitations , but schooling is there in the world today .
still it 's appalling that so many remain in extreme poverty .
ola rosling : yes , i have an idea , but first , i 'm so sorry that you were beaten by the chimps .
and they are exaggerated , and especially things we 're afraid of .
so we get a shorter list with the terrible results , like some few examples from hans , and we have no problem finding these kinds of terrible results .
the other way to think is , most things improve .
that 's a rule of thumb .
so first , let 's look at the change up till today , 2014 .
these three tough little buggers are , on the left , my grandmother , age five , and then her sister and brother , ages 11 and nine .
it 's a football field of unused land immediately below a very crowded area of the city , and it almost feels like you 're indiana jones on an archaeological dig , and all the details are all still there .
and right now , we 're focusing very closely on how we engage with the city of new york on really transforming the overall ecosystem in an integrated way .
for an example , the core of tps , which is making manufacturing of different models of cars on a single assembly line .
hi , kids .
now it is illegal for fathers to sell their daughters into servitude .
and i 've gained spirituality .
she has been a widow for nine years , but she 's not looking for another mate .
so isabel — i thank you .
i spent two nights in the hospital recovering from trauma and injuries .
in fact , so alien and unthinkable was this event that the response from the indian media , public and politicians proved one point : no one knew what to do .
[ " i am born with sisters and cousin who now live in cities and abroad but they never talk to me or complain about their daily difficulties like you say " ] now , the reactions confused me .
so that night , as i sat wondering how i should respond , i found myself filled with doubt .
most of us say that women are denied their rights , but the truth is , oftentimes , women deny themselves these rights .
i don 't think they thought i 'd grow up to sell insurance . so let me tell you how that happened .

how much worse is b than a ?
the fact that some of the victims carried personal items such as toothpaste and a toothbrush is a clear sign they had no idea what was about to happen to them .
many of them get destroyed , believe it or not , or they get simply shelved , out of sight and out of mind .

one in five americans is currently taking a psychopharmaceutical drug , from the antidepressants and antianxiety medications to the antipsychotics .
i also think it 's a huge part of facebook , the monkey that adopts the cat or the great dane who adopted the orphaned fawn , or the cow that makes friends with the pig , i would have told you that they were hopelessly sentimental and maybe too anthropomorphic in the wrong way and maybe even staged , and what i can tell you now is that there is actually something to this .
and she started telling me about her grandkids , and that blew my mind .
kids made hamburger cards that were made out of construction paper .
or trash yards .
the world wide web is celebrating this month its 25th anniversary .
but also , i want you to think about the 40 percent , because if you 're sitting there yourself sort of with a web-enabled life , you don 't remember things anymore , you just look them up , then you may feel that it 's been a success and we can all sit back .
so here are some of the things which maybe threaten the social web we have .
as a teacher , i 've internalized this message .
it is the air retreating from your chest because it doesn 't feel safe in your lungs .
by civics , i simply mean the art of being a pro-social , problem-solving contributor in a self-governing community .

and just in case you wondered , they shared one toilet in those small confines .
by then , the industry had advanced a lot , and we had different tools and techniques to manage disruptive behavior .
now the biggest and most controversial component of this design , of course , was the toilet .
these were small changes , and these changes created new possibilities .
and they 're here for a reason .
but prisons can do some things we never thought they could do .
thank you .
i see pitchforks , as in angry mobs with pitchforks , because while people like us plutocrats are living beyond the dreams of avarice , the other 99 percent of our fellow citizens are falling farther and farther behind .
rising inequality doesn 't just increase our risks from pitchforks , but it 's also terrible for business too .

a microbiologist friend of mine gave me a petri dish with a little yellow blob in it and told me to go home and play with it .
it retracted from empty areas and dead ends .
as such , it has been mathematically modeled , algorithmically analyzed .
other public engagement activities , i run lots of slime mold workshops , a creative way of engaging with the organism .
other people talked about bacterial communication .
i also liked to make environments for people to explore and play .
many of these pieces are later on shown in museums , biennials , triennial exhibitions around the world .
but every so often the music gets turned down , everyone stops talking , and stares at exactly the same thing .
and i said , " excuse me ? " and then i looked it up and they do drill into people 's brains .

this is about 2,000 frames a second , and i 'd like you to notice the tip that 's right there on the bottom , about to puncture through tissue .
he said , " do you have any questions ? " and i said , " just one , doc .
when you do the crossword puzzle or when you watch a magic show , you become a solver , and your goal is to try to find the order in the chaos , the chaos of , say , a black-and-white puzzle grid , a mixed-up bag of scrabble tiles , or a shuffled pack of playing cards .
and how about this puzzle invented in 18th-century england : the jigsaw puzzle .
are you so excited ?
okay , cool , and re-cap that marker and place it on the table .
yes , i think it does .
there 's more .
so ladies and gentlemen , the next time you find yourself with a puzzle , whether it 's in your life or in your work , or maybe it 's at the sunday morning breakfast table with the new york times , remember , you are all wired to solve .

so last year , we sent a bunch of students to shenzhen , and they sat on the factory floors with the innovators in shenzhen , and it was amazing .
sorona is a dupont process that uses a genetically engineered microbe to turn corn sugar into polyester .
and these people i wouldn 't have been able to find beforehand and probably were better that i found them just in time from the network .
i want to try to convince you here that this is mistaken .
why do we continue to send foreign aid to other countries when we need all the help we can get for ourselves ?

they control your phone .
so how does this work ?
so i spent some time trying to put this together , but wasn 't having a whole lot of luck , and finally i decided , i 'm going to get through this , and i 'm not going to leave until i figure out what this represents .
this is how computers think , ones and zeros .
it takes me seconds to pick out patterns here , but hours , days , to pick them out in ones and zeros .
if we take those same concepts and translate them into three dimensions instead , we find entirely new ways of making sense of information .
this is all well and good i wanted to find out if this would really work in the work i do every day .
i 've assembled for your pleasure here seven deadly sins of speaking .
it demeans our language , actually , sometimes .
a friend of mine described it as standing in your own truth , which i think is a lovely way to put it .
if i go down here in my throat , which is where most of us speak from most of the time .
it can be very powerful .
anytime you 're going to talk to anybody important , do these .
or to make that a bit larger , what would the world be like if we were creating sound consciously and consuming sound consciously and designing all our environments consciously for sound ?
in fact , their report states , " unfortunately , we do not have much data on the passwords users choose under particular rules .
this is still not really ideal for research , though , because it 's not entirely clear where all of these passwords came from , or exactly what policies were in effect when people created these passwords .
so what we found by running all of these 5,000 passwords we collected through these tests to see how strong they were , we found that the long passwords were actually pretty strong , and the complex passwords were pretty strong too .
he says , in fact , you 've already remembered it .
so these were random passwords that were generated by our computer .
one of the things that i did is i made a number of quilts , and i made this quilt here .
and what we found out -- we found 17 people so far , i think , who have the word " monkey " -- we found out about a third of them said they have a pet named " monkey " or a friend whose nickname is " monkey , " and about a third of them said that they just like monkeys and monkeys are really cute .
no one told me that i would live in fear , that i would become paranoid , no one told me that one day , i would become the person behind the trigger .
they made me examine things about my life that i hadn 't considered .

when i graduated from college , i couldn 't decide between two careers , philosophy and law .
suppose you have a choice between two jobs : you could be an investment banker or a graphic artist .
it 's not like we 're trying to choose between two things that can 't be compared .
that 's why the choice is hard .
so when we face hard choices , we shouldn 't beat our head against a wall trying to figure out which alternative is better .
and then they stop talking . and they wait for me to go away and talk to someone else .
now , a second question . again , a show of hands : how many of you have ever looked to see who edited the dictionary you are using ?
past winners in this category have included " recombobulation area , " which is at the milwaukee airport after security , where you can recombobulate .
i also have articles expressing concern about " invite " as a noun , " impact " as a verb , because only teeth can be impacted , and " incentivize " is described as " boorish , bureaucratic misspeak . "
and what should i do with their pronouncements ? "
there are going to be changes where you think , " really ?
every research direction that i tried led to a dead end .
and we would practice staying creative inside that stuck place .
now notice that i put b in the land of the known , because we knew about it in the beginning , but c is always more interesting and more important than b.
so you see , knowing about the cloud and about saying " yes , and " made my lab very creative .
they couldn 't hear what i was saying in the context of a 10 back-to-back powerpoint presentation conference .
police took this blurry photo of me holding leaflets as evidence .
but apparently , even exposing stuff like that is a threat .
but the choices they make have dramatic outcomes that influence us all .
indeed , many hackers do not resist those temptations , and so they are responsible in one way or another to billions of dollars lost each year to fraud , malware or plain old identity theft , which is a serious issue .
but i think there 's a greater story here still .
they can bring people together .
this is because access to information is a critical currency of power , one which governments would like to control , a thing they attempt to do by setting up all-you-can-eat surveillance programs , a thing they need hackers for , by the way .
it was the night that barack obama was elected .

here 's an animal climbing up a wall .
thank you .
that 's when the dinosaurs went extinct , that 's when 75 percent of the animal and plant species went extinct , and that 's when mammals overtook their ecological niche , and to anthropomorphize , biological evolution said , " hmm , this neocortex is pretty good stuff , " and it began to grow it .
i 've actually counted these modules .
so at first they thought they were triggering some kind of laugh reflex , but no , they quickly realized they had found the points in her neocortex that detect humor , and she just found everything hilarious whenever they stimulated these points .
i 've got three seconds .
every morning as a child , i 'd watch thousands of men walk down that hill to work in the shipyard .
when you sidestepped your own ego and you stopped telling your story , but told someone else 's story , someone perhaps without a voice , where empathetically , you stood in his shoes well they say , write what you know .
in the middle of the motorcycles , there 's a big , black rolls-royce .
okay , you have to join in if you know it . just a castaway an island lost at sea , oh another lonely day with no one here but me , oh more loneliness than any man could bear rescue me before i fall into despair i 'll send an s.o.s. to the world i 'll send an s.o.s. to the world i hope that someone gets my i hope that someone gets my i hope that someone gets my message in a bottle message in a bottle a year has passed since i wrote my note i should have known this right from the start only hope can keep me together love can mend your life but love can break your heart i 'll send an s.o.s. to the world i 'll send an s.o.s. to the world i hope that someone gets my i hope that someone gets my i hope that someone gets my message in a bottle message in a bottle message in a bottle message in a bottle walked out this morning i don 't believe what i saw a hundred billion bottles washed up on the shore seems i 'm not alone in being alone a hundred billion castaways looking for a home i 'll send an s.o.s. to the world i 'll send an s.o.s. to the world i hope that someone gets my i hope that someone gets my i hope that someone gets my message in a bottle message in a bottle message in a bottle message in a bottle it 's very easy . sing in unison . here we go .
maybe we should be studying those that are well .
you may also know that actually a line of therapy has been coming along based on that fact .
they didn 't say , " is this data going to be mine ? am i going to own it ? "
what are our genes ? "
but there are many aspects to this life that are far from idyllic .
and i do feel a little ridiculous that i 'm up here on this stage and i 'm choosing to use my time to tell you about a 100-year-old story about the invention of a squishy kid 's toy , but i 'd argue that the invention of the teddy bear , inside that story is a more important story , a story about how dramatically our ideas about nature can change , and also about how , on the planet right now , the stories that we tell are dramatically changing nature .
in a study where a fake snake and a fake turtle were put on the side of the road , drivers hit the snake much more often than the turtle , and about three percent of drivers who hit the fake animals seemed to do it on purpose .
i really love them . this one 's my favorite .
so after dinner , the orchestra started to play , and the guests burst into song , and all of a sudden , taft was surprised with the presentation of a gift from a group of local supporters , and this was a stuffed opossum toy , all beady-eyed and bald-eared , and it was a new product they were putting forward to be the william taft presidency 's answer to teddy roosevelt 's teddy bear .
we teach whooping cranes to migrate south for the winter behind little ultra-light airplanes .
how is it someone can go through the worst experience imaginable , and come home , back to their home , and their family , their country , and miss the war ?

statistically , you are safer as a teenage boy , you would be safer in the fire department or the police department in most american cities than just walking around the streets of your hometown looking for something to do , statistically .
i was particularly close to a guy named brendan o 'byrne .
brotherhood has nothing to do with how you feel about the other person .
so you think about brendan , you think about all these soldiers having an experience like that , a bond like that , in a small group , where they loved 20 other people in some ways more than they loved themselves , you think about how good that would feel , imagine it , and they are blessed with that experience for a year , and then they come home , and they are just back in society like the rest of us are , not knowing who they can count on , not knowing who loves them , who they can love , not knowing exactly what anyone they know would do for them if it came down to it .
and that was how i first got introduced to this whole idea of the military , because she thought this was a good idea .
and i thought about so much about the soldiers who i eventually had to end up leading .
and i just kind of followed in and started saying the same things to all my soldiers .
what was the experience like ? how are you doing ? "
medics come and they save her life , but then as she 's doing her recuperation back at home , she realizes that , " my job 's still not done . "
i survived that childhood through a mix of avoidance and endurance .
all of us with stigmatized identities face this question daily : how much to accommodate society by constraining ourselves , and how much to break the limits of what constitutes a valid life ?
in 1988 , i went to moscow to interview artists of the soviet underground , and i expected their work to be dissident and political .
people extol a difference only because it 's theirs .
in 2007 , six years after we met , my partner and i decided to get married .

the hour for those past thirty ... "
it was totally contrived just for that room , just for that moment .
ronnie : not at four o 'clock in the morning .
in fact , the oldest citation anybody sent in was from a cartoon from the stone age .
there are seven four in the mornings , and they 're all very dire .
and when i got to that point , i embraced it .
less than a week later , though , i received a little bit of grace .
" pg " is slavic literature .
so he didn 't want to lose any of her richness in the days before he 'd get home , and it is still , you 'll find websites that offer this as a major quirk .

so do go forward and do search for more .
during the savings and loan debacle in 1984 , we looked at every single failure , and we looked for common characteristics , and we discovered this recipe was common to each of these frauds .
and our examiners said , they are making loans without even checking what the borrower 's income is .
what happened in the governmental sector ?
flash forward to the current crisis .
these are the so-called too-big-to-fail institutions .
i 'm going to do so in a way that tells a story .
kathryn schulz : and that 's how it goes .
see , 30 years ago , you had the first digital samplers , and they changed everything overnight .
i was in the middle .
a lot of fuss was made about the sonic of the album that myself and salaam remi , the other producer , achieved , how we captured this long-lost sound , but without the very , very 21st-century personality and firebrand that was amy winehouse and her lyrics about rehab and roger moore and even a mention of slick rick , the whole thing would have run the risk of being very pastiche , to be honest .
thank you very much . thank you .
there are a few things that i looked at here .
and there are some things i didn 't look at .
there 's a bunch of code , and i get some friends to help , and we crack the code , and then inside that is another code , and then there are some equations , and then we solve those equations , and then finally out pops a message from google which is their official answer to my article , and it said , " no comment . "
marco tempest : but these robots were not real .
edi : wow !
to create the robotic illusion , we 've devised a set of ethical rules , a code that all robots would live by .
harold and i arrive in new york .
you bring it up at a dinner party or in a workplace environment , of touching the third rail .
i cite those statistics around corporate board diversity because they are real , and i stand here today talking about this issue of racial discrimination because i believe it threatens to rob another generation of all the opportunities that all of us want for all of our children , no matter what their color or where they come from .
he runs espn .
i 'm asking you to look at the people around you purposefully and intentionally .
so right now , what i 'm asking you to do , i 'm asking you to show courage .
okay .
i usually just try to use , like , the three little words that always make me feel better : sotomayor , sotomayor , sotomayor . just , it really helps me to get grounded .
first of all , that i 'm in hip hop , you know what i 'm saying .
well i have to say that i don 't know about how many of my organs have been 3-d printed as such , but i can tell you that it is so challenging to me , kind of thinking about this concept of the future and that , you know , all around the world parents are kind of telling their small children , please , you have to eat that , you know , i have slaved over a hot 3d printer all day so that you can have this meal .
and , you know , i just have to say , the whole thing with baldness , and , you know , here 's the thing .
next .
i would just like to say as an african woman that i believe the diet that we need is really to remove the crazy belief that there is anything wrong with a nice backside .
how can you be part of the solution ?
the stuff that we can 't resolve , the sub-scale processes , we need to approximate in some way .
so you can look at that piece , but you can look at the other pieces too .
big volcanoes go off and change the climate .
we can look at that too , and the models are skillful .
right ? we know that it 's gotten warmer .
we secured equipment , funds , vehicles , we trained a team , we set up a hundred clinics throughout the great rift valley to try and understand a single question : why are people going blind , and what can we do ?
now , all that 's needed is a single person on a bike with a smartphone .
so here we have the peek vision app .
bang ! the gun goes off .
on rare occasions , a high school kid does it .
but then in 2000 , the international cycling union decreed that anyone who wanted to hold that record had to do so with essentially the same equipment that eddy merckx used in 1972 .
in sports where height is prized , like basketball , the tall athletes got taller .
in swimming , the ideal body type is a long torso and short legs .
have you ever seen in a movie when someone gets an electrical shock and they 're thrown across a room ?
he 's pulling up on a rope .
these days , one in 88 children will be diagnosed with autism , and the question is , why does this graph look this way ?
in addition , another vulnerable and critical period in terms of development is when the mother is pregnant .
and so in fact , in some individuals with autism , it is genetic !
although there are that many genes , there is some method to the madness .
they learn in a different way .
and the museum noticed that people were spending a lot of time with this exhibit , and a researcher from a science education center in australia decided to study this exhibit and try to figure out what was going on .
it 's amazing how much emotion you can convey with just a few simple movements of a physical object .
and i have for you today the story of that journey , but also the notion that science can be as powerful as a translator as it can be for invention .
and professor nathan hart and his team had just written a paper which tells us , confirms that predatory sharks see in black and white , or grayscale .
and testing to simulate a person in a wetsuit in the water with a predatory shark in a natural environment is actually a lot harder than you might think .
so i can welcome sam , the surfer , from this side . where are you , sam ?
the technology has changed a number of times since i started work : photo , digital , desktop , screen , web .
unlike a fine art , such as sculpture or architecture , type hides its methods .
my instinct tells you that any improvement would be rather slight , because they were designed as functions of the system they were designed to fit , and as i said , type is very adaptable .
at the outset , at & amp ; t had wanted to set the phone books in helvetica , but as my friend erik spiekermann said in the helvetica movie , if you 've seen that , the letters in helvetica were designed to be as similar to one another as possible .
we wrote a compaction routine that reduces the size of all fonts by an order of magnitude .
apropos , in the mid- ' 90s , i started talking to microsoft about screen fonts .
in a binary bitmap , you actually can 't ask for more than that .
so now that their mission is accomplished , has that meant the demise of the screen fonts that i designed for coarser displays back then ?
it 's gotten smaller , it 's got less detail , less resolve .
it would be the same thing if i put my thumb up and blocked that spotlight that 's getting right in my eye , i can see you in the back row .
it separates from the telescope .
if we can take a similar space telescope , slightly larger , put it out there , fly an occulter in front of it , what we might see is something like that -- that 's a family portrait of our solar system -- but not ours .
do you see yourself as a male or female or somewhere in the spectrum in between ?
these people were -- many of them had to give up so much of their lives .
but once they gave them the hormones consistent with the gender they affirm , they look beautiful .
a male puberty .
this is what nicole would look like if we weren 't doing what we were doing .
thank you for indulging me .
their marital satisfaction is lower .
but that only made a parent 's role more confusing in a way .
so , absent being able to anticipate the future , what we all do , as good parents , is try and prepare our kids for every possible kind of future , hoping that just one of our efforts will pay off .
in fact , ucla recently did a study looking at the most common configuration of family members in middle-class homes .
but it is a very elusive one .
i was high as a kite on morphine .
but at least in my case , are they the ones that i think about the most ? and the answer is no .
you have to give to receive .
nothing we do , however virtuous , can be accomplished alone ; therefore we must be saved by love .
so they didn 't know how long gabby would be in a coma , didn 't know when that would change and what the prognosis would be .
i do .
she would call it an important fact-finding mission .
we 've gone through some tough times and it 's only made it stronger . gg : stronger .
so i didn 't actually resign from being an astronaut , but i gave up my job and they found a replacement .
he 's a fabulous service dog .
so far the national response has been pretty much to do nothing .
so they have a very , very nice connection .
as my family and i ran for safety when i was about 12 from one of those attacks , i resolved that i would do everything i could to ensure that my own children would not go through the same experiences we had .
thank you very much .
and by tracking markers on an insect 's wings , we can visualize the air flow that they produce .
with the tip of a powerful microscope , we can actually move atoms and begin to create amazing nano devices .
the reality is , the folks i described as the master teachers , the master narrative builders , the master storytellers are far removed from classrooms .
so i make the argument that we reframe teacher education , that we could focus on content , and that 's fine , and we could focus on theories , and that 's fine , but content and theories with the absence of the magic of teaching and learning means nothing .
but when i think about cities , i think about people .
unfortunately , that 's not how cities were being designed .
and this sandy wasteland had lain barren for 10 years , and we were told , unless we found a developer in six months , it would go bankrupt .
and if we had to go up , we had to go up in places where you wouldn 't need to own a car .
so in the areas where we zoned for significant development , i was determined to create places that would make a difference in people 's lives .
and see how the railing widens and flattens out so you can lay down your lunch or your laptop .
the high line was an elevated railway that ran through three neighborhoods on manhattan 's west side , and when the train stopped running , it became a self-seeded landscape , a kind of a garden in the sky .
public spaces always need vigilant champions , not only to claim them at the outset for public use , but to design them for the people that use them , then to maintain them to ensure that they are for everyone , that they are not violated , invaded , abandoned or ignored .
this is martin niemöller .
he 's friends of many of you in this audience , and seven years ago , aaron came to me with a question .
now if you know aaron swartz , you know that we lost him just over a year ago .
we had found in a poll that 96 percent of americans believe it important to reduce the influence of money in politics .
regardless of where you are , in new hampshire or outside of new hampshire , you can sign up and directly be informed where the candidates are on this issue so you can decide who to vote for as a function of which is going to make this possibility real .
and it 's also become a much more interactive place , where people are interacting with others , they 're commenting , they 're sharing , they 're not just reading .
we can do all of this really well .
it 's a hard thing to sit down and explain to an average user , and even if you do , what can the average user do about it ?
it 's possible , but i don 't think it 's something that we 're going to see change quickly .
we were already engaged to be married .
well , we decided that we 'd pick two causes , whatever the biggest inequity was globally , and countries that were really stuck , because with that level of death , and parents would have so many kids that they 'd get huge population growth , and that the kids were so sick so that was our global thing , and then in the u.s. , both of us have had amazing educations , could live up to its promise of equal opportunity is by having a phenomenal education system , and the more we learned , the more we realized we 're not really fulfilling that promise .
well , my graph has numbers on it .
maybe it needed someone who is turned on by numbers and graphs rather than just the big , sad face to get engaged .
melinda , early on , you were basically largely running the show .
so there 's a lot of collaboration .
you 're spending , like , a billion dollars a year in education , i think , something like that .
she was very , very shy .
nope . no . they won 't have anything like that .
but that 's great . that 's the role of philanthropy is to pick different approaches , including even in one space , like education .
that , to me , really changes that 's the most important .
for us , edge cases , those rare situations that are unlikely to occur , are more like norms .
here 's an example of an account engaged in classic spammer behavior , sending the exact same message to thousands of people .
so what do i do ?
when you take a picture with your smartphone or digital camera , there 's a lot of additional information saved along in that image .
as a freelance journalist , i sympathize .
and i 've been writing about these creatures ever since .
a few years back , a man called kevin lafferty took a group of scientists into three californian estuaries and they pretty much weighed and dissected and recorded everything they could find , and what they found were parasites in extreme abundance .
these hosts won 't get to survive or reproduce .
how does the parasite control its host in this way ?
and while that idea may be disquieting , i think that ability to surprise us makes them as wonderful and as charismatic as any panda or butterfly or dolphin .
what they all had in common was they worked very , very hard .
dad may have called this an oculus , but it was , in fact , a big hole in the roof .
to build the pantheon took some miracles .
it is my belief that to create these rare game changers requires you to pull off at least five miracles .
it 's more like the invention of concrete : important , absolutely necessary to build the pantheon , and enduring , but entirely insufficient by itself .
much of the road congestion in and out of our cities will disappear .
besides , once the first drivers explain to their confused car that the giant chicken at the fork in the road is actually a restaurant , and it 's okay to keep driving , every other car on the surface of the earth will know that from that point on .
i look forward to the conversation , so thanks for arranging for that .
the comeback on that is a couple of things : one , that he certainly believes that as a contractor , the avenues that would have been available to him as an employee weren 't available , two , there 's a track record of other whistleblowers , like [ thomas andrews drake ] being treated pretty harshly , by some views , and thirdly , what he was taking on was not one specific flaw that he 'd discovered , but programs that had been approved by all three branches of government .
that 's not how it works .
i don 't think that 's the right framing .
rl : yeah , of course there is .
but it 's been argued , and someone here in the audience has talked to a former nsa analyst who said metadata is actually much more invasive than the core data , because in the core data you present yourself as you want to be presented .
so i think it 's very serious . i think it 's number one .
would that be the point of view ?
on the other , the non-u.s.-related threats out of those 54 , the other 42 of them , the prism program was hugely relevant to that , and in fact was material in contributing to stopping those attacks .
we use the standards , we use the products that we recommend , and so it 's in our interest to keep our communications protected in the same way that other people 's need to be .
rl : so that 's out of my lane .
thank you so much .
and we had talked about that many , many times before .
imagine being threatened with losing your home sometimes over a debt of just a few hundred dollars , and not being able to find out who you were really up against .
and having made your choice , you then pick what type of company you want and then fill in a contact , name and address .
and what does it all mean for us ?
and so i come to my wish .
that is momentum .
and i got my pressure suit built around me and rode down outside in the van heading out to the launchpad -- in the astro van -- heading out to the launchpad , and as you come around the corner at the kennedy space center , it 's normally predawn , and in the distance , lit up by the huge xenon lights , is your spaceship -- the vehicle that is going to take you off the planet .
it 's an amazing experience .
i was thinking , what do i do next ?
how do you get around it , though ?
it 's not nearly as big a deal .
reporter : and you can see one of those search and recovery helicopters , once again that helicopter part of dozen such russian mi-8 helicopters .
my task was to study a group of inmates who had been clinically diagnosed as psychopaths .
and we looked at their physical response to those emotions .
so for example , your mother raises her hands to stretch , and you imitate her behavior .
so if you rear a mouse in a standard cage , a shoebox , essentially , with cotton wool , alone and without much stimulation , not only does it not thrive , but it will often develop strange , repetitive behaviors .
this stimulates the amygdala and may be a more effective rehabilitative practice than simple incarceration .
thank you .
he believed that government could be built by the people , and we call those people civic hackers .
on the national day of civic hacking this past june in oakland , where i live , the code for america team in oakland took the open source code base of honolulu answers and turned it into oakland answers , and again we held a write-a-thon and had citizens write the answers to them , and i got into the act .
they can actually build government .
now what does this tell us ?
they not only share things , they demand that things be shared : meat , shelter , protection , all these things that were supposedly being traded to women for their sexual fidelity , it turns out , are shared widely among these societies .
now , in addition to being a great genius , a wonderful man , a wonderful husband , a wonderful father , charles darwin was also a world-class victorian prude .
and you 'll see that the human , chimp and bonobo we equate to a special fridge you have in the garage just for beer .
so there are all sorts of examples like this that we go through in the book .
certainly , you know , lots of people say to me , just because we lived a certain way in the past doesn 't mean we should live that way now , and i agree with that .
and they are really complex and they can seem really far off , that the temptation may be to do this : bury our heads in the sand and not think about it .
in 2012 , state street migrated 54 applications to the cloud environment , and we retired another 85 .
in blue , we see the performance of the 500 largest global companies , and in gold , we see a subset of companies with best practice in climate change strategy and risk management .
the one that just really gets under my skin is , " if you want to do something about that , just make money , give the profits to charities . "
what if we work and save and invest , only to find that the world we retire into is more stressed and less secure than it is now ?
indeed , one wonders that without a duty of care , how many people would have had to suffer from gastroenteritis before stevenson eventually went out of business .
on the train back to london , i couldn 't get it out of my mind .
and as a consequence , across the western world , the over-simplistic policies of the parties of protest and their appeal to a largely disillusioned , older demographic , along with the apathy and obsession with the trivial that typifies at least some of the young , taken together , these and other similarly contemporary aberrations are threatening to squeeze the life out of active , informed debate and engagement , and i stress active .
but first , what do we call complexity ?
and you may be asking yourself which side i 'm on , biology or physics ?
it 's called fission-fusion dynamics , the property for an animal group of regularly splitting and merging into different subgroups .
the next spring , it didn 't form two communities like every year , which may have led the whole colony to die because it had become too small .
it 's a simplistic model .
dania gerhardt : thank you very much , nicolas , for this great start . little bit nervous ?
and this was a classroom about 50 or 60 years ago , and this is a classroom today .
we need to go from lectures on the blackboard to online exercises , online videos .
" honey , come over for dinner . "
but what if we embraced technology , embraced the millennial generation 's natural predilections , and really think about creating these online technologies , blend them into their lives .
now before we go too far into this , i 'd like to spend some time discussing some key ideas .
i mean , how else do you teach 150,000 students ?
and this can also be graded by the computer .
they can use as much or as little as they like , and it becomes a tool in the teacher 's arsenal .
but as we were doing our analysis we realized that there was a common root cause to these two issues that relates , in fact , to the basic pillars of management .
you have mr. noise , mr. petrol consumption , mr. anti-collision properties .
whenever people cooperate , they use less resources . in everything .
the soft approach : to make people cooperate , we need to make them like each other .
by removing layers .
the ceo of the lego group , he says , blame is not for failure , it is for failing to help or ask for help .
" i have two medical certificates to prove it . "
audience : sex .
when her condition became hard to hide , faiza 's mother helped her flee her father and brothers .
and although we don 't yet have an arab kinsey report to tell us exactly what 's happening inside bedrooms across the arab region , it 's pretty clear that something is not right .
" just say no " is what conservatives around the world say to any challenge to the sexual status quo .
no matter where we live and love .
and that 's frightening . it 's terrifying .
now , one group was asked to think about being dead .
but betting everything on the idea of finding the elixir and staying alive forever is a risky strategy .
or they like , they hope , to live on as part of some greater whole , a nation or a family or a tribe , their gene pool .
and so the characters of a book are not afraid of reaching the last page .
so what is a glacier ?
we followed this cave back for about a half mile until it came to an end , and then with the help of our survey tools we made a three-dimensional map of the cave on our way back out .
the next morning , we climbed out of the cave and hiked all the way to the top of the glacier , where we finally rigged and rappelled this pit for the very first time .
nelson mandela has come to the end of his long walk to freedom .
it 's not a new idea or value but it 's one that i certainly think at these times is worth building on .
and the first guests we ever got were a philanthropy group from your east coast , and they said to solly , on the side , they said , " before we even go out to see lions and leopards , we want to see where you live . "
as it bites the second time , i kick .
and he is one amazing example of what i have experienced all over africa .
it was sort of a hollow in the ground .
he was suffering .
most of us accept today that private property and a market economy is the best way to manage most of society 's resources .
in fact , buses are not sexy , but they are the only possible means to bring mass transit to all areas of fast growing developing cities .
how to distribute it between pedestrians , bicycles , public transport and cars ?
only 20 years later , between 1920 and 1930 , almost 200,000 people were killed by cars in the united states .
because of private property of land and high land prices , all developing country cities have a large problem of slums .
whereas the female lions hunt out in the open savanna over long distances , usually during the day , male lions use an ambush strategy in dense vegetation , and often at night .
and we can see biodiversity in ways that you never could have imagined .
what i 'm going to do is i 'm going to take you on a high-resolution , first-time tour of the carbon landscapes of peru and then panama .
the 2010 mega-drought is shown here with red showing an area about the size of western europe .
how do we do that if we don 't know the geography of biodiversity in the region , if it 's so unknown to science ?
but what 's good is that the technology we 've developed and we 're working with in south africa , for example , is allowing us to map every single tree in the savanna , and then through repeat flights we 're able to see which trees are being pushed over by elephants , in the red as you see on the screen , and how much that 's happening in different types of landscapes in the savanna .
so the first thing we need is more thumbs .
now — — before we get started -- this is great . you 're excited to play . — before we get started , can i have the slides back up here really quick , because if you get good at this game , i want you to know there are some advanced levels .
any other thumbs ?
we had some contentment .
so congratulations , grandmasters .
i turned to my grandmother , who always had plenty of advice , and she said , " stop being so picky .
in the meantime , my very large jewish family was already all married and well on their way to having lots and lots of children , and i felt like i was under tremendous peer pressure to get my life going already .
but the real failure was that there were plenty of men for me to date .
well , it turns out that these probably weren 't bad guys .
so things like that , but i also wanted somebody who would go to far-flung , exotic places , like petra , jordan .
she said she was a " fun girl who is happy and outgoing . "
the challenge here , though , is that the popular men and women are sticking to 97 words on average that are written very , very well , even though it may not seem like it all the time .
i 'm telling them about this fabulous news , and they say , " this is wonderful !
now , your matzoh balls .
neither can attack the other , because to attack the other side you 've got to come down the mountain into the valley and then up the other side , and you 're completely exposed .
and the giant sees this figure approaching , and calls out , " come to me so i can feed your flesh to the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the field . "
it 's not this , right ? it 's not a child 's toy .
that 's where his strength lies .
and then there 's that strange comment he makes to david : " am i a dog that you should come to me with sticks ? "
why is he so strangely oblivious to david that he doesn 't understand that david 's not going to fight him until the very last moment ?
a perinatal stroke could be something that can happen during the nine months of pregnancy or just suddenly after the birth , and in his case , as you can see , the right part of his brain has gone .
i mean we went really down , but at the end , we started to look at him , and we said , we have to react .
i am not saying -- — i am not saying it 's a miracle . that 's not the message , because we are just at the beginning of the path .
it 's more that i just liked the idea and doing something different .
and i wanted to go one step further , and one electron off .
looking at interactive newsprint .
it 's using bluetooth 4 , so it 's pretty instantaneous .
five years ago , for instance , i found myself waking each morning in misty seattle to what i knew was an impossible question : one desert night , half the world and almost half of history away ?
he was overwhelmed not with conviction , but by doubt .
like fundamentalists of all religious stripes , they have no questions , only answers .
and i , for one , refuse to live that way .
a few hundred billion dollars of losses in the financial sector of losses in world gdp in the global stock market .
remember , black swan is this rare bird that all swans should be white , so it has captured the idea of unpredictability , unknowability , that the extreme events are fundamentally unknowable .
this is rooted in 30 years of history of bubbles , starting in 1980 , with the global bubble followed by many other bubbles .
so how can we be so collectively wrong by misreading or ignoring the science of the fact that when an instability has developed , and the system is ripe , any perturbation makes it essentially impossible to control ?
we don 't release the report . it 's kept secret .
this will not be a speech like any one i have ever given .
so in 1967 , elections were coming , things were going well in the campaign , the house was electric .
negotiations are difficult , the tensions are high , progress is slow , and then , 10 minutes to 2 , a prime minister shouts out , " we have to finish in 10 minutes . "
instead of reaching out to the common or the collective wisdom in our societies , investing in it to find more creative solutions , we reverted to political posturing .
let 's see how we can bring people back to the process .
well , this is exactly where i think europe fits in .
george papandreou : well , obviously there were constraints which didn 't allow me or others to make the types of decisions we would have wanted , and obviously i had hoped that we would have the time to make the reforms which would have dealt with the deficit rather than trying to cut the deficit which was the symptom of the problem .
they are inherently unstable , and they need some form of automatic feedback control in order to be able to fly .
how did we design the algorithms to do this ?
balancing a pole is hard .
this quad has a racket strapped onto its head with a sweet spot roughly the size of an apple , so not too large .
interaction doesn 't have to be virtual . it can be physical .
what impact will the speed of machines have on our way of life ?
when you don 't have money , you must take time , and it took me seven years to do " mars et avril . "
well , i said as a joke in a production meeting -- and this is a true story , by the way — i said , " why don 't we turn this guy into a hologram ?
how do you get something that you can 't afford ?
so , again , my solution was to aim for the best possible artist that i could think of .
they bury their dead . they educate the next of kin .
but a few of them actually have dna fragments that survive for thousands , even a few millions of years in time .
it turns out that there are swaths of habitat in the north of siberia and yukon that actually could house a mammoth .
right ? a lot of men hear the term " women 's issues " and we tend to tune it out , and we think , " hey , i 'm a guy . that 's for the girls , " or " that 's for the women . "
john is the subject . beat is the verb .
and i 'm not going to shout down people who ask questions about women , okay ? it 's a legitimate thing to ask .
that 's a very naive notion , right ?
we live in the world together .
how do we support our friends ? but how do we not remain silent in the face of abuse ?
there 's been an awful lot of silence .
there 's no excuse for a college or university to not have domestic and sexual violence prevention training mandated for all student athletes , coaches , administrators , as part of their educational process .
we that have a choice have an opportunity and a responsibility to them as well .
now it 's not just that that 's bad for democracy , though i think it probably is , it 's actually not a very clever business strategy , actually .
actually , we 've got ourselves locked into this industrial era mindset which says that the only people who can make cities are large organizations or corporations who build on our behalf , procuring whole neighborhoods in single , monolithic projects , and of course , form follows finance .
they 're challenging the idea that if you want something to be affordable it 's got to be one-size-fits-all .
and we and others have built a few prototypes around the world now , and some really interesting lessons here .
you know , like it or not , welcome to the world 's biggest design team .
who 's making these things ? how did they make them ?
so kids don 't have as hard of a time with this , and i saw in my own son , i gave him this book .
and so you can kind of hack a pencil , and the electricity runs through your body too .
and i 'll just hook up the forward arrow .
and so we put it up on kickstarter , and hundreds of people bought it in the first day .
and a huge eruption of discussion around accessibility came , and we 're really excited about that .
so i started wondering and pondering , could it be that the best years of american economic growth are behind us ?
negative .
the next headwind is education .
we had the vertical city , the invention of the elevator .
of course , when the motor vehicle was invented , and it became almost ubiquitous by 1929 , that agricultural land could be used for human consumption or for export .
but i 'm now going to give you an experiment .
so if you are possessed by an evil spirit causing neurologic or psychiatric problems , then the way to treat this is , of course , to make a hole in your skull and let the evil spirit escape .
now , about a hundred thousand patients in the world have received deep brain stimulation , and i 'm going to show you some examples of using deep brain stimulation to treat disorders of movement , disorders of mood and disorders of cognition .
it 's a genetic disorder , and it involves a twisting motion , and these children get progressively more and more twisting until they can 't breathe , until they get sores , urinary infections , and then they die .
