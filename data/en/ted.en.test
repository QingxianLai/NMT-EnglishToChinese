people that have partnered with us have given us new eyes , not only on what exists -- the new landscapes at the bottom of the sea -- but also how we think about life on the planet itself .
you hear about giant squid and things like that , but some of these animals get up to be approximately 140 , 160 feet long .
the average depth at the top of it is about a mile and a half .
and then we had some hint that these things existed all along the axis of it , because if you 've got volcanism , water 's going to get down from the sea into cracks in the sea floor , come in contact with magma , and come shooting out hot .
he 's managed to grab a tip of these worms .
this is from the atlantic . even greater depth .
the vents are emitting a black body radiation -- an ir signature -- and so they 're able to find these vents at considerable distances .
this bacteria that we 've been talking about turns out to be the most simplest form of life found .
everything on this planet -- everything -- works by cycles and rhythms .
you know , i 'm sick and tired of us not living up to our potential .
last .
let 's go back to the same three areas .
i want to go back to work because i need to further my career or i just want to go have coffees .
what are qualities of a bulgarian work ?
nature isn 't stupid , and it selected for play .
really cool term : neoteny -- the retention of play and juvenile traits in adults .
we hold ourselves back .
for example , it stimulates creativity .
and you 're going to say , " gee , that can work for fedex out there in the united states , but it can 't work in bulgaria .
it does , and it can , work in bulgaria .
and we 're going to do things like eliminate restrictions .
because we can 't do it alone . we have to do it together , and together , if we do this and share these ideas on play , we can transform bulgaria for the better .
so with pisa , we try to change this by measuring the knowledge and skills of people directly .
we see in other countries that it matters much less into which social context you 're born .
and korea also invests into long school days , which drives up costs further .
so you ask yourself , if education has become so much more expensive , has it become so much better ?
they took up the challenge , and korea was able to double the proportion of students achieving excellence in one decade in the field of reading .
and you know what 's interesting ? you won 't believe it , but there are countries in which the most attractive place to be is not the shopping center but the school .
they provide an environment also in which teachers work together to frame good practice .
they attract the strongest principals into the toughest schools , and the most talented teachers into the most challenging classroom .
that report was written by 620 scientists from 40 countries .
and it takes weeks to perform our integrations .
and out of that field campaign we 'll probably get a few dozen papers on a few dozen processes or molecules .
we 're going to fly into my colleague peter 's brain .
they 're watching their own brain activation , and they 're controlling the pathway that produces their pain .
its artists told stories across national boundaries , in as many languages , genres and philosophies as one can imagine .
it 's a remarkable comment on slums , poverty and aspiration .
" to sir , with love " ignited its teen audience .
in a moment she can invoke images of running barefoot on table mountain and playing cops and robbers .
and it 's okay if we remember tom hanks better than astronaut jim lovell or have ben kingsley 's face superimposed onto that of gandhi 's .
in 2009 , i first heard about diybio .
biohackers work alone .
well , working with the safe organisms that we normally work with , the chance of an accident happening with somebody accidentally creating , like , some sort of superbug , that 's literally about as probable as a snowstorm in the middle of the sahara desert .
you can analyze your breakfast cereal for gmo 's , and you can explore your ancestry .
i 'm trying to do this in english .
so i immediately called her up , of course .
you say , " huh , what do you mean ? "
i 'm so used to that .
but what you 're seeing here is 160 to 175 degrees , and anything over 150 is superhydrophobic .
everyone that sees this gets excited , and says , " oh , i could use it for this and this and this . "
now , you must have all taken a band-aid off at some point , and you must have wondered what 's the right approach .
or , if you had to choose between the last two , which one would you choose ?
people did this . i would pay people four dollars for their task -- on average people would solve four problems .
some people shredded the whole sheet of paper .
then they shredded it . no cheating whatsoever .
i 'll tell you what i think about this and the stock market in a minute .
here is what happens .
what happens in a situation when you create something where you pay people a lot of money to see reality in a slightly distorted way ?
but it was actually more interesting than that , because she said , " i did not think that your intuition was right .
when legislators and others think about economic development , what they first of all think about are business tax incentives , property tax abatements , job creation tax credits , you know , there are a million of these programs all over the place .
they are growing because they have high levels of skills .
so , you know , maybe ohio 's thinking about investing in more preschool education for children in columbus , ohio , but they 're worried that these little buckeyes will , for some strange reason , decide to move to ann arbor , michigan , and become wolverines .
i mentioned there 's a multiplier of about three , 2.78 , for the state economy , in terms of over 80 billion in extra earnings .
the first idea i 'd like to suggest is that we all love music a great deal . it means a lot to us .
and music is very fun , but it 's also transformative .
i wanted to show you a quick video of some of this work before i go on .
and then they can also , when you snap , line up exactly the way you 'd like to .
i have always loved music and i am excited to be able to conduct my own music with this new software .
but what about expression ? what about that moment when an artist delivers that piece of work ? you know , do our technologies allow us to express ?
so , are we ready adam ?
i 've played the disney hall here and carnegie hall and places like that .
this is the room that bach wrote some of his music for . this is the organ .
okay .
and they 'd say , " play that part again . "
it 's like the guy is sitting next to you , whispering who knows what into your ear .
i grew up with a radio in a car .
so birds do it too .
there 's the life that everyone sees , and then there 's the life that only i see .
we don 't see it on facebook . we don 't see it on twitter .
but for me , for a large part of my life , i feared myself .
well , we haven 't done that , so we can 't really expect to find an answer when we 're still afraid of the question .
we 're people , and we have problems .
and i was like , " what 's going on ? "
it became , you know , at some point it was really , really intense .
and suddenly , there is something that was happening that was good news . so the guys on the news , they say , " okay , let 's talk about this . "
today the israel-loves-iran page is this number , 80,831 , and two million people last week went on the page and shared , liked , i don 't know , commented on one of the photos .
remember that image from the beginning ?
we can just send a message and hope for the best .
it begins to melt below the boiling point of water and does not drive off the oily contaminants for which it is a sponge .
but , mostly bottle caps .
now , how do we analyze samples like this one that contain more plastic than plankton ?
this is brian rooney for nightline , in long beach , california .
nineteen million hectares of rainforest are lost every year to create new arable land .
and if we look at what those settlements were like , we see they were compact .
and if you look at the name of one of those streets , bread street , you can tell what was going on there 300 years ago .
so this was obviously an organic city , part of an organic cycle .
we used to cook ; now we just add water , or a little bit of an egg if you 're making a cake or something .
utopia was actually a word that thomas moore used deliberately .
it 's common . it 's fresh .
it 's about the relationship between the city and the countryside .
so looking at their three main markets for their product which were basically transportation design , interiors and furniture , we came up with the solution of taking an old airstream trailer and gutting it , and trying to portray laminate , and a trailer , in kind of a fresh , new contemporary look .
and what i was trying to do there was direct your eye in the space , so that you would perceive the geometry in a different way , and that the casework wouldn 't break up the space .
so the problem became -- and they set this dilemma to me -- that you have to design the interior using only our existing technology , and there 's no money for tooling or molding .
imagine what your life would be like if i were to stroke it with this feather , but your brain was telling you that this is what you are feeling -- and that is the experience of my patients with chronic pain .
well you probably imagine that the nervous system in the body is hardwired like your house .
we treat them with symptom-modifying drugs -- painkillers -- which are , frankly , not very effective for this kind of pain .
but in reality , it is managed by and for those who have the resources to go out and exploit it .
well , as i said , we had a group of photographers that went out on board ships and actually photographed the activities in process .
it 's actually a bay .
unfortunately , the world heritage convention does not recognize the need to protect areas beyond national jurisdiction , at present .
but many of you have said , if you get these marine protected areas , or a reasonable regime for high seas fisheries management in place , how are you going to enforce it ?
it 's helping to bring an incredible group of talented people together to really try to solve and penetrate these problems that have created our obstacles to management and rational use of this area that was once so far away and remote .
this disease was terrifying .
hundreds of people died -- children as well as adults .
and we 've got pretty good vaccines , as i 've just showed you .
with polio it 's almost completely different .
and in each of those , it was only part of the country .
there 's absolutely no question .
and now they 've even started using these devices -- speaking of cool technology -- these little devices , little gis trackers like this , which they put into the vaccine carriers of their vaccinators .
today marks exactly six months -- and for the first time in history , not a single child has been paralyzed in uttar pradesh or bihar .
help us tell the story .
but right now we don 't have enough of that .
what i 'd like to do now is share with you a very special handful of secrets from that collection , starting with this one .
" your mic wasn 't off during sound check .
he said , " but this time it seemed like it was taking her forever to get through each one . "
" that 's me , my husband and son .
thank you .
and when they were about five and six , four and five , jay could come to me , come to me crying .
we lived in new york city , as i said .
and he did spend a lot of time up to no good .
because for me growing up at that time , and our relationship with this man box , " do you want some ? " meant one of two things : sex or drugs -- and we weren 't doing drugs .
because , while sheila never said no , she also never said yes .
the center for disease control says that men 's violence against women is at epidemic proportions , is the number one health concern for women in this country and abroad .
then you take off .
the jumpmasters start to check the door .
now the army teaches you to do five points of performance -- the toes of your feet , your calves , your thighs , your buttocks and your push-up muscles .
this was my father in vietnam .
but everything we do is in a different context .
and so instead of giving orders , you 're now building consensus and you 're building a sense of shared purpose .
and he said , " sir , he 's fine . thanks for asking . "
and i learned personal relationships were more important than ever .
i saw . " what is that ? " i asked .
it 's not like i can just check it in the lab .
i wore a sanitary pad . i filled animal blood in a football bottle , i tied it up here , there is a tube going into my panties , while i 'm walking , while i 'm cycling , i made a press , doses of blood will go there .
that 's why i am giving this machine only in rural india , for rural women , because in india , [ you 'll be ] surprised , only two percent of women are using sanitary pads . the rest , they 're using a rag cloth , a leaf , husk , [ saw ] dust , everything except sanitary pads .
that 's why i 'm not running after this bloody money .
is there alien life out there ?
moreover , we can calculate a probability that the universe was created in different states .
this brings me to the last of the big questions : the future of the human race .
we will take it as a salutary warning , i think , for the rest of our conference this week .
so we did .
then another year goes by .
and terence died six days later .
both of them said the same thing : do nothing if there is no further hope .
you 've succeeded in everything you 've done , and having a patient die , well , that must feel like failure .
as a result , he spent just four days in hospice , which i 'm sure , as you all know , is a pretty typical outcome , and we never said goodbye because we were unprepared for the end .
how can we learn that people 's decisions about their loved ones are often based strongly , powerfully , many times irrationally , on the slimmest of hopes ?
that was a turning point for my life .
well , what happened over the last 25 years ?
speaking of risk , we have seen that price volatility of food crops in africa is the highest in the world .
we now recognize that getting markets right is about not just price incentives , but also investing in the right infrastructure and the appropriate and necessary institutions to create the conditions to unleash the power of innovation in the market .
and over the last decade , you see that the share of western exchanges -- and this is the u.s. share of exchanges in the world -- has gone down by nearly half in just the last decade .
what 's really important is that the ecx will operate a market information system to disseminate prices in real time to farmers around the country , using vsat technology to bring an electronic price dissemination directly to farmers .
ethiopia 's agricultural market is 30 percent higher than south africa 's grain production , and , in fact , ethiopia is the second largest maize producer in africa .
and if you have children , you 've seen this hundreds of times before .
i can delete that dot because that 's clearly a measurement error .
and very quickly , my brain starts to think that 's the accurate ratio of negative to positive in the world .
when they 'd come to visit me , they 'd look around , they 'd say , " this freshman dining hall looks like something out of hogwart 's from the movie " harry potter , " which it does .
and into the silence , i said , " i 'd be happy to speak at your school , but just so you know , that 's not a wellness week , that 's a sickness week .
doctors are 19 percent faster , more accurate at coming up with the correct diagnosis when positive instead of negative , neutral or stressed .
and we really have this incredibly simplistic view of why people work and what the labor market looks like .
and he was working very hard on this presentation -- graphs , tables , information .
this other condition was inspired by david , my student .
and not only that , everybody knew that the bionicles would be destroyed quite soon .
i can 't tell you who they were , but they were a big company in seattle .
and he would tell them , " at the moment i directed you in this way , and now that i am directing you in this way , everything will be okay . "
and this is basically the result we had before .
i put things in the wrong way .
now it was your cake . now everything was fine .
so for some people we gave the same task .
and when you were about to leave , the parents said , " hey , by the way , just before you leave , if you 're interested , they 're for sale . "
i think the answer is no .
and it was for , you guessed it , speed yoga .
i just thought , and i thought long and hard .
we turn every moment of every day into a race to the finish line -- a finish line , incidentally , that we never reach , but a finish line nonetheless .
and blue-chip medical colleges everywhere are starting to study these things to find out how they work , and what we might learn from them .
and some of the most heartrending emails that i get on my website are actually from adolescents hovering on the edge of burnout , pleading with me to write to their parents , to help them slow down , to help them get off this full-throttle treadmill .
we fill our head with distraction , with busyness , so that we don 't have to ask , am i well ? am i happy ? are my children growing up right ?
i still love speed . you know , i live in london , and i work as a journalist , and i enjoy the buzz and the busyness , and the adrenaline rush that comes from both of those things .
he 'd gone and stapled two cards , very like these , together , and put a sticker of his favorite character , tintin , on the front .
it 's a hotel that 's only open until midnight , so it 's not a place that you stay .
and for donor agencies , unfortunately , the audience tends to be people that aren 't even in the country they 're working [ in ] .
for those in vulnerable , low-lying nations , how do you put a dollar value on losing your country where you ancestors are buried ? and where will your people go ?
but as important as technology and infrastructure are , perhaps the human element is even more critical .
third , adapting to rising seas .
adaptation 's too important to be left to the experts .
there is no authorship . architects are obsessed with authorship .
ok , now , this i 'll come back to later , but something , actually , the librarians at first said , " no , this isn 't our mandate .
what you 're seeing on the right is the design of the library , specifically in terms of square footage .
that skin serves double duty , again for economics .
this is actually the place that we put into the building so i could propose to my wife . right there .
it 's almost as though the building could be placed anywhere : wherever you place it , the area underneath it is charged for theatrical performances .
i 'm going to show now the last project .
in fact -- and you know this -- this is called the time warner building .
now i only have about 30 seconds , so i want to start an animation , and we 'll conclude with that . thank you .
now the thing is , i would like to put it to you that the main reason why we think that malaria is a bad thing is because of a characteristic of malaria that it shares with aging .
but the question is , are they so dangerous -- these risks of doing something about aging -- that they outweigh the downside of doing the opposite , namely , leaving aging as it is ?
like , for example , making up these ridiculous reasons why aging is actually a good thing after all .
but unfortunately the thing is that we don 't understand metabolism very well .
but after that , things were pretty steady and pretty uniform .
well , it seems to get the point across .
secondly , what does it mean for the public 's perception of how long it 's going to take for us to get to those things , starting from the time we get the mice ?
and this turns out to be useful .
and there are only seven of them .
and of course the main thing is that you shouldn 't trust people who call themselves gerontologists because , as with any radical departure from previous thinking within a particular field , you know , you expect people in the mainstream to be a bit resistant and not really to take it seriously .
ag : brilliant . thank you for asking a question that i can answer with an uncontroversial answer .
there are species that have no aging -- hydra for example -- but they do it by not having a nervous system -- and not having any tissues in fact that rely for their function on very long-lived cells .
north , you 've got china ; south , you 've india , pakistan , bangladesh , all these countries .
i was gasping for air .
instead of swimming crawl , swim breaststroke .
but i 'm also a famous minor television personality and an avid collector of design within reach catalogs , so i pretty much know everything there is .
one other thing about it , if you do have one at home , let me tell you one of the features you may not know : when you fall asleep , it comes alive and it walks around your house and goes through your mail and watches you as you sleep .
and unlike the juicy salif , it does not threaten to attach itself to your brain , rather , it simply attaches itself to your brain .
but too late .
you can experience their sense of place .
was the internet actually a place that you could visit ?
you can you hold them in your hand . they 're like a garden hose .
and i was particularly interested because i wanted to see one of these cables being built . see , you know , all the time online we experience these fleeting moments of connection , these sort of brief adjacencies , a tweet or a facebook post or an email , and it seemed like there was a physical corollary to that .
thank you .
that bigness should be centered on oneself , not in terms of money , not in terms of power you wield , not in terms of any status that you can command in the society , but it should be centered on oneself .
no religion can demolish that by indoctrination .
all of them are totally accepted because you discover your wholeness in yourself .
your own experience reveals , in spite of all limitations , you are the whole .
that 's interesting to me .
i owe my participation in this now-historic event to ted .
the reason that the electronic jellyfish worked as a lure is not because giant squid eat jellyfish , but it 's because this jellyfish only resorts to producing this light when it 's being chewed on by a predator and its only hope for escape may be to attract the attention of a larger predator that will attack its attacker and thereby afford it an opportunity for escape .
exploration is the engine that drives innovation .
google glass : อร ่ อยman 9 : mmm , อร ่ อย .
and ironically , if you want to hear it better , you actually just cover your ear , which is kind of surprising , but that 's how it works .
but it really opened my eyes to how much of my life i spent just secluding away , be it email or social posts or whatnot , even though it wasn 't really -- there 's nothing really that important or that pressing .
and you 'll get paid for it . you can think about it , if you want .
i once had the distinct privilege of sitting in on the apple call center for a day .
when you buy a piece of software , it 's not like buying a vase or a candy bar , where you own it .
you 've obviously never opened all the toolbars , but all you have to type in is this little , teeny window down here .
i believe in consistency with possible , real-world equivalents , trashcan folder when possible , label things mostly .
i 'm like , " you 're a what ? " he goes , " well , jeff hawkins , the ceo , says , ' if any task on the palm pilot takes more than three taps of the stylus , it 's too long , and it has to be redesigned . ' so i 'm the tap counter . "
so it 's big , so it 's slow . you 've got nowhere to go . i 'm not doing this for praise .
you won 't believe me .
the sonos thing -- it 's catching on .
and conversely , if somebody sends me hate mail -- which happens daily -- i say , " piss off . "
i 'm a third-generation phd , a daughter of two academics .
i 've talked about what 's desperately necessary .
paul offit : ... vaccine allowed us to eliminate polio virus .
at the end of the course , the students got a certificate .
so here the video pauses , and the student types in the answer into the box and submits . obviously they weren 't paying attention .
specifically , what 's lacking is the kind of critical thinking work that is so essential in such disciplines as the humanities , the social sciences , business and others .
some of these were physical study groups along geographical constraints and met on a weekly basis to work through problem sets .
educational researcher benjamin bloom , in 1984 , posed what 's called the 2 sigma problem , which he observed by studying three populations .
i beg to differ with mark twain , though .
and i actually didn 't leave my house for about three days .
and i said , " do you remember when we were in college and really wild and kind of dumb ? "
the first is vulnerability is not weakness .
adaptability to change is all about vulnerability .
so when i became vulnerability ted , like an action figure -- like ninja barbie , but i 'm vulnerability ted -- i thought , i 'm going to leave that shame stuff behind , because i spent six years studying shame before i really started writing and talking about vulnerability .
you can 't fix that problem without addressing shame , because when they teach those folks how to suture , they also teach them how to stitch their self-worth to being all-powerful .
i don 't think the world understands that because of shame .
the thing to understand about shame is it 's not guilt .
so i would opt for , yes , you have a little shame .
when we reach out and be vulnerable we get the shit beat out of us .
and even if you got as perfect as you could and as bulletproof as you could possibly muster when you got in there , that 's not what we want to see .
as a matter of fact , this is by far the most important commission that leonardo has ever had , and for doing this great masterpiece , he was named the number one artist influence at the time .
okay ? let 's go and find the elephant .
and we released to youtube this , the virtual choir project , 185 singers from 12 different countries .
i felt shy , i felt embarrassed .
i 'm telling you where i need your help .
and i want to thank all of you in the audience for being great husbands , great mothers , friends , daughters , sons .
we back so far up we 're finally seeing a containment around us -- the afterglow of the big bang .
so you 're seeing the edge of the earth .
these are some of the questions that are at the center of my exploration on the nature of erotic desire and its concomitant dilemmas in modern love .
what is the relationship between love and desire ?
basically , when i get back in touch with my ability to imagine myself with my partner , when my imagination comes back in the picture , and when i can root it in absence and in longing , which is a major component of desire .
novelty is , what parts of you do you bring out ?
so when i began to think about eroticism , i began to think about the poetics of sex , and if i look at it as an intelligence , then it 's something that you cultivate .
you know , the erotic mind is not very politically correct .
are you going to curse me ? are you going to scold me ?
but what they know is they know how to resurrect it .
prisons , of course , are where people who break our laws are stuck , confined behind bars .
although we can 't bring trees and prairie plants and frogs into these environments , we are bringing images of nature into these exercise yards , putting them on the walls , so at least they get contact with visual images of nature .
so it started when jonny was little , and he first started the banjo , he would play on his back with his eyes closed , and we 'd say it looked like he was sleeping .
if we abstract this process , and simplify it as much as possible , then we could start with a single sheet of paper , one surface , and we could make a fold and divide the surface into two surfaces .
they can stretch . they can tear .
they 've been used throughout history to express ideals about beauty , about technology .
and the architect is really , he moves into the position of being an orchestrator of all of these processes .
and in this case , i used abs plastic to produce the columns , we used the bigger , faster machine , and they have a steel core inside , so they 're structural , they can bear loads for once .
it tells the story of sputnik , and the story of what happened to america as a result .
in closing , i would like to take a moment to thank one of my investors : longtime tedster , jay walker .
ok , this is the route up everest .
these are some climbers reaching the top of the icefall just at sun-up .
everybody 's on oxygen , your supplies are limited , and you either have to go up or go down , make that decision very quickly .
you can see here some ferocious winds blowing snow way high off the summit .
this is a view taken along the summit ridge .
this is taken from camp three , where i was .
so what we did was , we got the victims down to 21,000 feet , where it was easier for me to treat them .
so , as i was taking care of beck , he related what had been going on up there .
you have the middle area , where the temporal lobe might be , in here , and the posterior portion , where the maintenance functions are in the back .
it 's an area in which a lot of neuroscientists believe the seat of will exists .
and we had a memorial service there a few days later .
i 'll show you some statistics .
even for amphibians .
it 's a compound that 's found in polycarbonate plastic , which is what baby bottles are made out of .
but it turns out that this ancient structure that separates us from other animals , the placenta , cannot evolve or adapt fast enough because of the rate that we 're generating new chemicals that it 's never seen before .
blimey .
it 's not just my work in amphibians , but similar work has been shown in fish in europe , holes in the testes and absence of sperm in reptiles in a group from south america and in rats , an absence of sperm in the testicular tubules as well .
and my urging is that when we think about environmental issues that we remember that it 's not just about melting glaciers and ice caps , but it 's also about our children as well .
and companies that actually define a true north , things that are nonnegotiable whether times are good , bad , ugly -- doesn 't matter .
take another example , i was walking around in one of our villages in india .
we introduced something called the unilever sustainable living plan , which said , " our purpose is to make sustainable living commonplace , and we are gong to change the lives of one billion people over 2020 . "
the self as we once knew it no longer exists , and i think that an abstract , digital universe has become a part of our identity , and i want to talk to you about what i think that means .
it has shrunk because our instruments enable us in part to measure smaller and smaller units of time , and this in turn has given us a more granular understanding of the material world , and this granular understanding has generated reams of data that our brains can no longer comprehend and for which we need more and more complicated computers .
every digital landmark is an invitation to leave what you are doing now to go somewhere else and do something else .
we might think that those younger than us , those who are born into this , will adapt more naturally .
i wanted to learn to skip , and she found an old rope and she tucked up her sari and she jumped over it .
camp was more like a keg party without any alcohol .
and i made these self-negating choices so reflexively , that i wasn 't even aware that i was making them .
but nowadays , your typical classroom has pods of desks -- four or five or six or seven kids all facing each other .
and i often think that they have the best of all worlds .
so ...
so that 's the world we 're living in today .
and people would come from all over to hear him speak .
thank you .
thank you very much .
i mean , in retrospect , probably stupid questions , but things like , " what 's this caps lock key for ? "
and just by drawing on a little computer tablet , the entire light fixture adjusts to what shape you want .
and this is what we 're pursuing here .
the bottles connect together , and you can create different shapes , different forms .
and then the integration of all these great technologies , which you 've heard about , the wi-fi antennas that allow the kids to connect ; the screen , which you can read in sunlight ; the keyboard , which is made out of rubber , and it 's protected from the environment .
these are the dispensers . there 's this friendly shape .
i have not slept in weeks .
and at the same time , i thought about this massive group of people i knew : writers , editors , journalists , graduate students , assistant professors , you name it .
we took all that down , and we found beautiful wooden floors , whitewashed beams and it had the look -- while we were renovating this place , somebody said , " you know , it really kind of looks like the hull of a ship . "
anyway , we bought ' em , we set everything up and then we waited .
and the other thing was , there was no stigma .
so the key to it all is homework !
we went in there thinking , " we 're ultimately , completely malleable . you 're going to tell us .
and we said , " isabel allende is going to read all your essays at the end .
but people would come in -- and this was before the pirate movies and everything !
this is sam potts ' great design that did this .
all the designers , all of the builders , everybody was local , all the time was pro-bono .
there 's four family members that come in every day .
you can walk up to your local school and consult with the teachers . they 'll always tell you how to help .
then human beings stepped out of the darwinian flow of evolutionary history and created the second great wave of evolution , which was we changed the environment in which we evolved .
this is a cama .
and by the way , the reason the kittens here are orange and these are green is because that 's a bioluminescent gene from coral , while this is from jellyfish .
so in the lower right here , you have dolly , the first cloned sheep -- now happily stuffed in a museum in edinburgh ; ralph the rat , the first cloned rat ; cc the cat , for cloned cat ; snuppy , the first cloned dog -- snuppy for seoul national university puppy -- created in south korea by the very same man that some of you may remember had to end up resigning in disgrace because he claimed he had cloned a human embryo , which he had not .
these are really hybrids , not pure animals .
the scientists can make this creature go left , right .
so now we have organic computer chips made out of living , self-aggregating neurons .
and so , we need to ask ourselves some questions .
our robot belongs to a family of robots called ballbots .
with almost no force i can control his position and his velocity .
do you know which group you 're in ?
the pre-eminent mammographer in the united states issued the following quote to the washington post .
but imagine how difficult it would be to find that tumor in this dense breast .
screening the average young woman with an mri is kind of like driving to the grocery store in a hummer .
it 's made not of a bulky tube , but of a thin layer of a semiconductor material that serves as the gamma detector .
so here 's an example .
so this is not just young women that it 's benefiting .
i was at a conference of 60,000 people in breast-imaging last week in chicago , and i was stunned that there was a heated debate as to whether we should be telling women what their breast density is .
we grew up interacting with the physical objects around us .
but you can also search in the digital world , or maybe you can write a query , saying , " what is dr. smith 's address ? "
i think that 's why this is called a head-mounted projector , isn 't it ?
and later i can find a wall , anywhere , and start browsing those photos or maybe , " ok , i want to modify this photo a little bit and send it as an email to a friend . "
i removed the microphone from that , and then just pinched that -- like i just made a clip out of the microphone -- and clipped that to a piece of paper , any paper that you found around .
this is incredible , really .
so i 'm excited about how i can bring the technology to the masses rather than just keeping that technology in the lab environment .
dh : a type of juggling i actually invented , right after i saw another juggler do it .
dh : oh ! it 's time for richard 's help .
it 's kind of neat . ok .
dh : one more , one more .
still juggling .
dh : do you have a small farm animal ?
bf : we 're going on .
we 're going to show you right now an excerpt from a routine that we used to wipe out the other juggling team competition .
and it 's awfully windy over there .
bf : yes .
and it 's not just aging that causes arthritis .
there 's not enough young , healthy people falling off their motorcycle and donating that tissue to us .
what about getting to a total biologic knee replacement , not just the parts ?
okay , i 'm going to show you again something about our diets .
well we know that that was not a cheap war .
more than 1,000 species -- an enormous variety .
one gram of cochineal costs about 30 euros .
and of course , we are not there to say that 's only for us , it 's not for them .
we 're not taking the bonus yet .
even if you don 't like it , you 'll have to get used to this because at the moment , 70 percent of all our agricultural land is being used to produce livestock .
that 's why we 're changing the perception of insects .
a couple of years ago , we had 1,750 people all together in a square in wageningen town , and they ate insects at the same moment , and this was still big , big news .
all right . okay , so ... perfect .
they share , they give , they give away for free .
he 's a terrible producer of videos , but it 's great content , so i 'm going to give you a little bit of it .
and it 's not just that it yields a different kind of product at the end , it 's that potentially it changes the way that we relate to each other .
indeed , mickey mouse himself , of course , as " steamboat willie , " is a remix of the then , very dominant , very popular " steamboat bill " by buster keaton .
so the point is the republicans here recognize that there 's a certain need of ownership , a respect for ownership , the respect we should give the creator , the remixer , the owner , the property owner , the copyright owner of this extraordinarily powerful stuff , and not a generation of sharecroppers .
imagining that i had this deep conspiracy to reveal the obvious flaws in the dmca .
let me come back to now , now when i 'm a little leftist -- i 'm certainly left-handed , so at least a lefty -- and i wonder , can we on the left expect to build this ecology of freedom , now , in a world where we know the extraordinarily powerful influences against it , where even icons of the left like this entertain and push bills that would effectively ban the requirement of open access for government-funded research ?
1.1 million of them .
so let 's not forget who is really paying the price of this financial collapse .
the main characters in the story are bacteria and viruses .
so replacing the bacteria dna with virus dna turns the bacteria into a factory for making viruses -- that is , until it 's so filled with viruses that it bursts .
you know , in the communication of science there is this obsession with seriousness .
you know , i keep talking about this idea of telling a story , and it 's like science communication has taken on this idea of what i call the tyranny of precision , where you can 't just tell a story .
but i think that 's unlikely .
so we ran off to a sushi bar .
and they are so excited . that 's the first board off the line .
last but not least , bill gates , i know you invented windows .
then i was very lucky to win the competition to build the second pompidou center in france in the city of metz .
we can make it better .
i started commuting to kobe , and i met the society of vietnamese people .
2001 , in west india , i built also a shelter .
so we went there to build partitions with all the student volunteers with paper tubes , just a very simple shelter out of the tube frame and the curtain .
all right .
and you can do the same with your genes and track them back in time .
of course , they cannot , but i 'm telling you already that the environment and the carrying capacity of this region was drastically different from what we have today .
here is a close-up of the fossil , after five years of cleaning , preparation and description , which was very long , as i had to expose the bones from the sandstone block i just showed you in the previous slide .
so when you measure those teeth , it was clear that she turned out to be a girl with very small canine teeth .
but not everything was human , and i will give you a very exciting example .
but if this species , ancient species , would travel in time and see us today , they would very much be very proud of their legacy , because they became the ancestors of the most successful species in the universe .
if you have damage there , like in alzheimer 's , you can 't remember things including where you parked your car .
so the one on the top likes to fire sort of midway between the walls of the box that their rat 's in .
now grid cells are found , again , on the inputs to the hippocampus , and they 're a bit like place cells .
so it may be that the neural mechanisms for representing the space around us are also used for generating visual imagery so that we can recreate the spatial scene , at least , of the events that have happened to us when we want to imagine them .
where are we ?
the first is : if society 's to make any progress on this issue , we need an honest debate .
and it went like this : wake up well rested after a good night 's sleep .
there 's got to be a middle way .
because she had to be somewhere else with the other three children for that evening .
" what constitutes a good life ? "
would it be a good idea for everyone to believe in the evil eye , so that when bad things happened to them they immediately blame their neighbors ? probably not .
and just admitting this -- just admitting that there are right and wrong answers to the question of how humans flourish -- will change the way we talk about morality , and will change our expectations of human cooperation in the future .
another thing to notice is there may be many peaks on the moral landscape : there may be equivalent ways to thrive ; there may be equivalent ways to organize a human society so as to maximize human flourishing .
now , it is the position , generally speaking , of our intellectual community that while we may not like this , we might think of this as " wrong " in boston or palo alto , who are we to say that the proud denizens of an ancient culture are wrong to force their wives and daughters to live in cloth bags ?
but the demagogues are right about one thing : we need a universal conception of human values .
i wouldn 't want to belong to any string theory club that would have me as a member .
so , some combustible material there .
and i think there are clearly right answers to that .
when so many women and girls are beaten , raped , maimed on a daily basis in the name of all kinds of causes -- honor , religion , nationality -- what allows women to replant trees , to rebuild societies , to lead radical , non-violent movements for social change ?
her daughter , rani , a few years older than me , sat in her lap bewildered , not knowing what had happened to the confident woman she once knew as her mother .
the prophet wanted every believer to be able to read the koran for themselves . "
look at those young girls who go back to school when acid is thrown in their face . "
in the middle ages , troubadours would travel across the land singing their tales and sharing their verses : lesbor travels through the balkans like this , singing , connecting people divided by religion , nationality and language .
they stood for weeks -- first just 10 , then 20 , then 50 , then hundreds of women -- wearing white , singing , dancing , saying they were out for peace .
women like sakena and leah and layma have humbled me and changed me and made me realize that i should not be so quick to jump to assumptions of any kind .
they are saying , we don 't have to be like you to make change .
in other words , as you heard chris say , i 've spent the last five years thinking about being wrong .
dreadful , thumbs down , embarrassing -- thank you , these are great answers , but they 're answers to a different question .
think back for a moment to elementary school .
everything seems to have gone fine .
this attachment to our own rightness keeps us from preventing mistakes when we absolutely need to and causes us to treat each other terribly .
i just imagined it everywhere , " which has happened .
for good and for ill , we generate these incredible stories about the world around us , and then the world turns around and astonishes us .
and they gave me lodging with a single mother and her daughter .
i wish to go to school . "
globally , we have policies , international instruments , work leaders .
one young woman i met , teen mother of four , never thought about finishing high school , graduated successfully ; never thought about going to college , enrolled in college .
these were the things that were going through the head of this other young woman -- i failed , i failed , i failed .
as part of my work , i 'm doing these tours in different villages and towns -- 13 , 15 hours on dirt roads -- and there is no community that i 've gone into that i haven 't seen intelligent girls .
they were able to mobilize young women .
they choose to leave their homes in order to earn money , to learn new skills , and to see the world .
unlike , say , a traditional maker of shoes or cabinets , the worker in an industrial factory has no control , no pleasure , and no true satisfaction or understanding in her own work .
slowly it was dawning on me that these handbags were made by their factory , and every single one of them was authentic .
later , she married a fellow migrant worker , moved with him to his village , gave birth to two daughters , and saved enough money to buy a secondhand buick for herself and an apartment for her parents .
their parents are often illiterate , and then they come to the city , and they , on their own , at night , during the weekends , they 'll take a computer class , they 'll take an english class , and learn really , really rudimentary things , you know , like how to type a document in word , or how to say really simple things in english .
and as you can see , it 's been knocked about a bit , which is not surprising because it was made two and a half thousand years ago and was dug up in 1879 .
what happened next was remarkable , and it 's where our cylinder enters the story .
" thus said cyrus , king of persia , ' all the kingdoms of the earth have the lord god of heaven given thee , and he has charged me to build him a house in jerusalem .
and the result of that was an empire that included the areas you see on the screen , and which survived for 200 years of stability until it was shattered by alexander .
because the cylinder account and the hebrew bible account differ in one key respect .
that 's 1879 .
it 's the only object they want .
it certainly says far more about real freedoms than magna carta .
we gotta kill them because they 're making a mess .
it turns out that crows aren 't just surviving with human beings -- they 're actually really thriving .
no one taught her to bend this into a hook , had shown her how it could happen .
it 's fairly interesting .
so we know that there 's lots of crows .
and so this goes on for some time .
or maybe do search and rescue ?
now what is a tribe ? a tribe is a group of about 20 -- so kind of more than a team -- 20 to about 150 people .
you 're all a member of tribes .
now , my birthday is coming up shortly , and my driver 's license expires .
i 'm great and you 're not .
and my question on the other side is just going to be , " what do you think they value ? "
now , some of you may not recognize the scene that 's up here .
in fact , most of the document is written at stage two .
but you don 't leave them where you found them . okay ?
that 's called a triadic relationship .
first of all : we all form tribes , all of us .
and the last thing we want to see is drug-resistant strains of hiv popping up all over the world , because it will make treatment more expensive and it could also restore the pre-arv carnage of hiv / aids .
thank you very much .
so all the grasses , which means all of the cereal crops , and most of the trees have wind-borne pollen .
they might say , " i 've got a bit of nectar . do you want to come and get it ? "
the other thing it does is that this plant mimics another orchid that has a wonderful store of food for insects .
and if you look down into it , there 's this sort of dam past the spadix , flies get attracted by the heat -- which is boiling off volatile chemicals , little midges -- and they get trapped underneath in this container .
and many of the tropical flowers are red , and that 's because butterflies and birds see similarly to us , we think , and can see the color red very well .
and that could be the basis of a sunscreen because sunscreens work by absorbing ultraviolet light .
this is the theme of my talk today .
all right ! it calls for celebration .
and that 's right . art is about going a little nuts and justifying the next sentence , which is not much different from what a kid does .
in that moment , art makes you happy because it 's not work .
here 's my story : i was an eighth grader and i entered a drawing contest at school in gyeongbokgung .
no crows are brought up .
some people turn into rockers like this .
right now , we need to start our own art .
what kind of sentence is this ? look at your handwriting ! "
it saves our souls and makes us live happily .
and here 's what she answered : " just do it . "
you know , sunday morning , you flick the paper , get your cappuccino .
in that context a gentleman came to my office at that time .
and i thought , i 'm just dumb and i cannot find it .
but it 's one thing to have a concept ; it 's a totally separate thing to actually make it work .
a lot of numbers there . a lot of numbers .
and i can , but i 'll give you just , maybe one , and depending on time i may give you two examples who we work with .
luckily , we had enough time to help boris nikolayevich take all the assets out of that company and bring him into a new one , to get all the subscription lists , rehire staff .
imagine that this third of this room is filled with people who represent different foundations .
you can , once you have all of those different points , you can make it easy for investors .
you know , we have all these gaps and i think we like our gaps because they make us feel like we identify with something , some smaller community .
and sad , negative feelings are darkly colored .
montage causes all of the feelings that contain photographs to become extracted and display themselves in a grid .
other views are also available .
" i love how i feel today . "
but , you know , as i looked at this more and more and more , and saw these images go across the rocks , i realized i was seeing the same archetypal events depicted again and again and again .
so , universe will open here .
we can isolate just the photographs , and we now see those .
and then we can also see a timeline .
it 's a narrative spread across a number of different disciplines , in which cooperation , collective action and complex interdependencies play a more important role .
we saw scientific revolutions , the protestant reformation , constitutional democracies possible where they had not been possible before .
another economic game that may not be as well known as the prisoner 's dilemma is the ultimatum game , and it 's also a very interesting probe of our assumptions about the way people make economic transactions .
but there is really no longer any major debate over the fact that cooperative arrangements have moved from a peripheral role to a central role in biology , from the level of the cell to the level of the ecology .
instead of , " neither of us can trust each other , so we have to make suboptimal moves , " it 's , " you prove to me that you are trustworthy and i will cooperate . "
so i enlist you to help me get the cooperation project started .
it helped local lech walesa to kick out one million soviet troops from poland and beginning the end of the soviet union as we know it .
and , i mean , there is a set of conditions .
it 's selection of strategies and tactics .
and then it 's about humor . humor is such a powerful game-changer , and of course it was very big in poland .
this is the mutilated face of the guy who was beaten by the police .
this is birhan , who was the ethiopian girl who launched live aid in the 1980s , 15 minutes away from death when she was rescued , and that picture of her being rescued is one that went round the world .
we now have the capacity to find common ground with people who we will never meet , but who we will meet through the internet and through all the modern means of communication ; that we now have the capacity to organize and take collective action together to deal with the problem or an injustice that we want to deal with ; and i believe that this makes this a unique age in human history , and it is the start of what i would call the creation of a truly global society .
100 years ago in most countries in europe , the pressure was for the right to vote .
take climate change . is it not absolutely scandalous that we have a situation where we know that there is a climate change problem , where we know also that that will mean we have to give more resources to the poorest countries to deal with that , when we want to create a global carbon market , but there is no global institution that people have been able to agree upon to deal with this problem ?
take the problems of human rights and the problems of security in so many countries around the world .
but it is said that in ancient greece when demosthenes spoke to his audiences , people turned to each other and didn 't say " great speech . "
and she said , " people in eastern dress , in drapes , walking up and down stairs .
she knew it was a hallucination .
she said , " did he have them himself ? "
and then he saw a big wheel in midair .
and then the six figures came together again , like a concertina .
as a physician , i have to try and define what 's going on , and to reassure people , especially to reassure them that they 're not going insane .
faces , and sometimes deformed faces , are the single commonest thing in these hallucinations .
so you may not only have " car " cells , you may have " aston martin " cells .
think of the number of blind people .
i 've gone and had an fmri myself , to see how my visual cortex is taking over .
we chose rats .
now how do we communicate with rats ?
if you can bring in more rats , we can actually make the output even bigger .
you put these 10 samples at once in the cage .
also , to standardize the pellets , the food rewards , and to semi-automate this in order to replicate this on a much larger scale and affect the lives of many more people .
now in the nature area , we look at whether or not we are innately equipped with something , perhaps in our brains , some abnormal chromosome that causes this muse-like effect .
and my mother believed that something had gone wrong , and she was gonna find out what it was , and she was gonna fix it .
so , when i look at creativity , i also think that it is this sense or this inability to repress , my looking at associations in practically anything in life .
it is constantly there . and , just as an example , this is one that recently came to me .
i saw examples of that . once i identified this question , it was all over the place .
we are all concerned with things that we see in the world that we are aware of .
and that goes into the story , too .
what is the nature of accidents ?
the book comes and it goes . when it arrives , it is no longer my book .
thank you very much !
i actually believe that we are in a wide open frontier for creative experimentation , if you will , that we 've explored and begun to settle this wild land of the internet and are now just getting ready to start to build structures on it , and those structures are the new formats of storytelling that the internet will allow us to create .
the experience of egan 's story , of course , like anything on twitter , there were multiple ways to experience it .
they comment on politics , they cry out against the evils of congress .
he 's always taking off his sunglasses or turning to the camera , but these things just happen in text .
but nothing , nothing prepared me for what i was to hear on the first of july 2008 .
but to go from where i was to where i wanted to be , i needed something .
durga , the epitome of creative feminine energy , or shakti .
jambo , bonjour , zdravstvujtye , dayo : these are a few of the languages that i 've spoken little bits of over the course of the last six weeks , as i 've been to 17 countries i think i 'm up to , on this crazy tour i 've been doing , checking out various aspects of the project that we 're doing .
if we do spring from a common source , how did we come to occupy every corner of the globe , and in the process generate all of this diversity , the different ways of life , the different appearances , the different languages around the world ?
well , historically , it has been studied using the science of paleoanthropology .
and he talked about africans and americans and asians and europeans , and a blatantly racist category he termed " monstrosus , " which basically included all the people he didn 't like , including imaginary folk like elves .
now , a quick primer on dna .
these are two pieces of dna that we use quite widely in our work .
this was an african man who gave rise to all the y chromosome diversity around the world .
this is a paleo-climatological map of what africa looked like between 60,000 and 70,000 years ago , reconstructed from all these pieces of evidence that i mentioned before .
the evidence is that humans begin to specialize in particular prey species , at particular times of the year .
now , that story i just told you is literally a whirlwind tour of how we populated the world , the great paleolithic wanderings of our species .
but there are people who retain that link to their ancestors that allows us to contextualize the dna results .
and that was largely because there weren 't any .
i was told i was dyslexic .
and that was when i had the idea .
and very quickly , some letters started coming back .
and that 's the beautiful thing about the camera .
and it was an incredibly thing , working with the u.n.
and suddenly , we started to institutionalize this day .
children can lead their projects .
while i was filming these statements , he said to me , " where are you going next ? "
and she was really crucial in getting the message in .
and then that year , that year , 2008 , this isaf statement from kabul , afghanistan , september 17th : " general stanley mcchrystal , commander of international security assistance forces in afghanistan , announced today isaf will not conduct offensive military operations on the 21st of september . "
linking up with the olympics -- i went and saw seb coe . i said , " london 2012 is about truce .
he said , " no , i 'd talk to the individuals . "
but i am surprised by one thing that they do have : coca-cola .
so they take the data , and they use it to measure progress .
and they decided in 1990 that they wanted to start training the local entrepreneurs , giving them small loans .
they 're starting to talk about , " how do you have the health community workers generate their own ideas ?
both songs have something in common : that same appeal of celebration and unity .
but then you take the toilet and you position it as a modern , trendy convenience .
so if you look back to 1988 , there are about 350,000 cases of polio on the planet that year .
that 's how you keep a huge outbreak from spreading , and it shows what can happen when local people have the data in their hands ; they can save lives .
20 researchers can stand on a bridge suspended inside of the sphere , and be completely immersed in their data .
they 're actually singing these densities to you with higher pitches mapped to higher densities .
what you 're seeing here right now is a superposition of an electron in the lower three orbitals of a hydrogen atom .
after all , if it is being done somewhere by someone , and we can participate virtually , then why bother leaving the house ? "
we don 't live to eat and make money .
so again , there wasn 't an awful lot of joy or fun to be had .
or , " that 's nice . you know , my grandmother 's going on a cruise to antarctica next year . you know .
everyone was very excited about this archaeological find , because it meant that they might finally be able to assemble a single dodo skeleton .
and i looked down at this sculpey , and i thought , maybe , yeah , maybe i could make my own dodo skull .
and after about six weeks , i finished , painted , mounted my own dodo skeleton .
i 'd bought a replica , a really crappy replica , of the maltese falcon on ebay , and had downloaded enough pictures to actually have some reasonable reference .
so i was able to actually screen-shot and freeze-frame to make sure .
and this thing , it 's deeply , deeply satisfying to me .
but really , if we 're all going to be honest with ourselves , i have to admit that achieving the end of the exercise was never the point of the exercise to begin with , was it .
it really is that simple in concept , though not in execution .
once you 've made it , the installation 's quite easy .
back to the theme of the presentation : in multidisciplinary research , how on earth does a process engineer used to working with boilers end up producing a medical device which transforms his own life ?
so the horizontal images were all an inversion .
they didn 't understand it ; they were doctors , they were next to god .
" yeah , well of course , i 'm looking after my patient . "
if you have any questions , please come up and talk to me later on .
and to put it really bluntly , you know , people are willing to pay for stuff that has value , right ?
yes , they do a whole bunch of other stuff , but they 're very good at this .
and pretty much everyone does it at some point .
it could be a phone number , it could be an e-mail address , it could be a postal address .
you take a 10 or 20 percent commission , and then you -- the kiosk operator takes 10 or 20 percent commission , and passes the rest over to you in cash .
they also write them in hindi .
so what does it mean when people 's identity is mobile ?
and so the speed of the adoption of things is just going to become that much more rapid , in a way that we just totally cannot conceive , when you get it to 6.3 billion and the growth in the world 's population .
because only once before has the fate of individual people and the fate of all of humanity been so intertwined .
now global warming was unforeseen .
let 's pretend that our government supported an oil-based economy , while discouraging more sustainable forms of energy , knowing all the while that the result would be pollution , war and rising costs .
that 's just the united states .
there were neighborhood restaurants run by local people , but none of them would think to open another one .
oranges became common in new york .
thanks to farm subsidies , the fine collaboration between agribusiness and congress , soy , corn and cattle became king .
meanwhile , food production had become industrial . industrial .
that 's good .
there is no good reason for eating as much meat as we do .
and that happens to be quite easy .
so the goal here is to achieve sentience in machines , and not just sentience , but empathy .
and then i started hanson robotics , which has been developing these things for mass manufacturing .
i 'm the puzzle columnist for discover magazine .
i read martin gardner 's columns in scientific american .
the progression of my career that you 'll see is looking for creating puzzles that have a memorable impact .
not strictly an ambigram in the conventional sense .
the goal here is to take the pieces on the left and make them so they look like the shape on the right .
now we 'll make it harder , a little harder .
and i said , " well , how on earth can you come up with a sequence of the base pairs in dna ? "
she could easily be up here giving a talk about her work .
everybody now considers themselves a creator , and not just a viewer .
anybody ?
building is at the heart of the experience : hands on , deeply immersed and fully committed to the problem at hand .
and meanwhile , i use nonsense , as you can see .
but the zeppelin was the biggest thing that ever moved made by man .
they had two machine guns and a cannon , and they had 90 horsepower ricardo engines .
urban absurdism -- that 's what the new yorker really calls for .
this is the audition for " king kong . "
could we bring down the lights please ? thank you .
thank you .
but those of us living in environmental justice communities are the canary in the coalmine . we feel the problems right now , and have for some time .
but , besides being a black woman , i am different from most of you in some other ways .
600,000 people were displaced .
this is lafayette avenue -- and as redesigned by matthews-nielsen landscape architects .
anyway -- ok . katrina . prior to katrina , the south bronx and new orleans ' ninth ward had a lot in common . both were largely populated by poor people of color , both hotbeds of cultural innovation : think hip-hop and jazz .
now , we 'll have even less than that stat i told you about earlier .
for his brilliant efforts , he was nearly impeached .
i was making him an offer .
and i said , why don 't you use that ?
so you can find a little feature on a bacterium that you don 't like , like staphylococcus -- i don 't like it in particular , because it killed a professor friend of mine last year .
there was a big gap between the one billion in the industrialized world and the two billion in the developing world .
and what happened a month ago was that the chinese company , geely , they acquired the volvo company , and then finally the swedes understood that something big had happened in the world .
what about the poorest two billion here ?
can you see , as the years pass by , child survival is increasing ?
with green technology and with investments to alleviate poverty , and global governance , the world can become like this .
this man refused to fold to the conventions of normalcy and just decided to fold .
b.j. was one of many fellow inmates who had big plans for the future .
there 's pretty illegal hustles : you run a tattoo parlor out of your own cell .
and how about finances ? anybody check that today ?
so the question is , how can we get the people in this room and across the globe to start paying attention to the energy we 're using , and start wasting less of it ?
we built software and partnered with utility companies who wanted to help their customers save energy .
it 's in this room . it 's you , and it 's me .
we did everything that letter told us to do , and still i know there must be more .
they didn 't talk . but most of all , they were extraordinarily isolated from the world around them , from their environment and from the people .
and soon enough , they start to learn about the meaning of things , because when somebody is looking at something or somebody is pointing at something , they 're not just getting a directional cue , they are getting the other person 's meaning of that thing , the attitude , and soon enough they start building this body of meanings , but meanings that were acquired within the realm of social interaction .
so we feel sometimes that the brain is deterministic , the brain determines who we are going to be .
and yet , the median age of diagnosis in this country is still about five years , and in disadvantaged populations , the populations that don 't have access to clinical services , rural populations , minorities , the age of diagnosis is later still , which is almost as if i were to tell you that we are condemning those communities to have individuals with autism whose condition is going to be more severe .
what we want is to embrace that world and bring it into our laboratory , but in order for us to do that , we had to create these very sophisticated measures , measures of how people , how little babies , how newborns , engage with the world , moment by moment , what is important , and what is not .
now , we thought that those data were so powerful in a way , that we wanted to see what happened in the first six months of life , because if you interact with a two- and a three-month-older , you 'd be surprised by how social those babies are .
we want them to be free of that .
are there concrete things we can do to reduce stress , draw our family closer , and generally prepare our children to enter the world ?
and these meetings had this effect while taking under 20 minutes .
even the sutherlands told me that they had an agile thanksgiving , where you had one group of people working on the food , one setting the table , and one greeting visitors at the door .
what worked well this week ?
i think the time is right for an agile family manifesto .
we 'll make sunday meals more important . "
but the single biggest lesson we learned is to reverse the waterfall as much as possible .
children who plan their own goals , set weekly schedules , evaluate their own work build up their frontal cortex and take more control over their lives .
we are travelers , not tourists .
spend time retelling the story of your family 's positive moments and how you overcame the negative ones .
you don 't need some grand plan . you don 't need a waterfall .
what is your strategy in your household ?
so this is the first 315 billion .
guns , gun sales , according to the fbi , who does background checks , are up almost 25 percent since january .
but seriously , we also have this phenomenon on madison avenue and in other places , where people are actually walking out of luxury boutiques with ordinary , sort of generic paper bags to hide the brand purchases .
so micropayments have become huge .
but they also talk about the fact that their executives , all of their expense reports are put onto their company intranet for everyone to see .
so , what brands can do , and companies , is pay dividends to consumers , be a brand that lasts , offer transparency , promise you 're going to be there beyond today 's sale .
so , this rise of this sort of local currency is another really interesting phenomenon .
this kogi doesn 't exist . it 's a moving truck . right ?
of the five senses , vision is the one that i appreciate the most , and it 's the one that i can least take for granted .
so , here 's my dad : he 's a scientist , he 's an engineer and he 's a military contractor .
or even the people who actually pulled it off , the people at bolt , beranek and newman in boston , who just would sketch out these structures of what would eventually become a worldwide network , and sketching things on the back of napkins and on note papers and arguing over dinner at howard johnson 's -- on route 128 in lexington , massachusetts , just two miles from where i was studying the queen 's gambit deferred and listening to gladys knight & amp ; the pips singing " midnight train to georgia , " while -- -- in my dad 's big easy chair , you know ?
so -- so this was my nature . the thing was , i saw that the route that i took to discovering this focus in my work and who i was , i saw it as just this road to discovery .
and within 100 years , you already start to see word balloons and captions , and it 's really just a hop , skip and a jump from here to here .
now , the monitor is just as limited as the page , technically , right ?
see what 's going on here as we draw these stories on an infinite canvas is you 're creating a more pure expression of what this medium is all about .
what are we going to do about it ? i define simplicity as a means to achieving clarity , transparency and empathy , building humanity into communications .
at such and such a date , ibm has responsibilities , you have responsibilities .

by the way , the wages for librarians went up faster than the wages for other jobs in the u.s. over that same time period , because librarians became partners of computers .
in fact , robots have become sort of ubiquitous in our lives in many ways .
here chris took the object out of its hand , and baxter didn 't go and try to put it down ; it went back and realized it had to get another one .
these robots we 're shipping every day .
that 's climate change and demographics .
and that we will all come to rely on robots over the next 40 years as part of our everyday lives .
i have gone on to find more things and discover that dinosaurs really were very social .
and then , then , then , and then ...
so a few years went by , and then we started the hell creek project .
it was extraordinary .
avian dinosaurs are our modern birds .
or any of the other funny-looking little dogs .
now that 's a good characteristic .
we want to stop that gene from turning on , fusing those hands together , so we can get a chicken that hatches out with a three-fingered hand , like the archaeopteryx .
today 's its debut .
without this ability there is no magic .
but when the scenario we have imagined suddenly flips into something entirely unexpected , we laugh .
they give us our identity and a sense of community .
but upon arrival there , in the fall of 1986 , and doing a lot of interviews , i found that the only thing i was offered was to be assistant to the art director at alfred a. knopf , a book publisher .
now the hepburn book was written in a very conversational style , it was like she was sitting across a table telling it all to you .
that was a relief to see that pour out of the machine .
and david especially loved this design because at book signings , which he does a lot of , he could take a magic marker and do this .
this particular story by osama tezuka is his epic life of the buddha , and it 's eight volumes in all . but the best thing is when it 's on your shelf , you get a shelf life of the buddha , moving from one age to the next .
then he 'd run his hand over the rag paper , and the pungent ink and the deckled edges of the pages .
so even though we love publishing as an art , we very much know it 's a business too , and that if we do our jobs right and get a little lucky , that great art can be great business .
isn 't that cool ?
now , i know why i 'm here .
i was still in deep grief ; i knew i didn 't have the strength .
but she knows where he is .
then we sat in a circle with support , with help , from people experienced in this kind of reconciliation .
after all , i 'm one of the green guys : i grew up with hippie parents in a log cabin .
i 've been doing it for the last year , and it 's great .
and i recovered , thanks to the miracles of modern medicine , insulin and other things , and gained all my weight back and more .
and unfortunately , if you want to learn about the microorganisms , just looking at them in a microscope is not sufficient .
they did this because this was common practice in medicine , even though it was obvious that this was not a good idea .
premature infants have real problems with their microbial community .
and he shrugged it off , i think he either thought i was just complaining a lot , or it was the typical m.d. " nothing can be wrong with my children . "
so it may be good for the waistline , but it probably won 't keep you satiated for very long .
of course evolution is somewhat random , and you know , about 55 million years ago there was this rebellious little puffer fish faction that said , oh , the heck with the coral reefs -- we 're going to head to the high seas .
and unfortunately , they make up a large portion of the california by-catch -- up to 26 percent of the drift net .
so what are we trying to find out ? we 're focusing on the pacific .
so we 've also tagged one part of the pacific ; we 've gone over to another part of the pacific , and we 've tagged in taiwan , and we tagged in japan .
but also what 's important is that they 're not slacker , lazy fish .
and to me that -- i don 't think i could say it any better than the immortal bard himself : " one touch of nature makes the whole world kin . "
a human standing in front of an unprotected capsule would die instantly .
i do take certain liberties and intervene .
this film shows the testing of a new explosive fill on a warhead .
essentially they 've simulated a city for urban combat , and this is one of the structures that exists in that city .
but through exposure to composite sketches , polaroids , mug shots and line-ups , eyewitness testimony can change .
he served 13 years of a life sentence in waco , texas .
and it reiterates that distortion is a constant , and our eyes are easily deceived .
well , we asked thousands of people .
is this just a form of mis-prediction that doesn 't have consequences ?
human beings are works in progress that mistakenly think they 're finished .
they 're excitatory .
and for parkinson 's disease , cochlear implants , these have indeed been able to bring some kind of remedy to people with certain kinds of disorder .
so these molecules are called channelrhodopsins .
and when the light turns off , these cells go back to normal , so they don 't seem to be averse against that .
and one of the things that we did was to adopt a very classical model of fear .
if we could do that , this could be extremely powerful .
most of us don 't have fungi or algae in our brains , so what is our brain going to do if we put that in ?
and the goal , of course , of this maze is to get out of the water and go to a little platform that 's under the lit top port .
the second thing that i think i heard you say is you can now control the brain in two colors , like an on / off switch .
freeflying is more the three-dimensional skydiving .
2005 i did a base jump from the eiger , from the monk and from the jungfrau , three very famous mountains in switzerland .
i think we all might have some questions .
what do you do to to cover your face ?
it 's an old new york school building , nothing fancy .
" uh-huh , uh-huh , uh-huh . " " let 's practice . everybody start chatting . "
it 's yes , sir ; no , sir ; no excuse , sir . "
and at that moment they shut out all the other languages that they could be learning at that age , but by three months , that 's her .
the gift of a good start . every child ought to have a good start in life .
and they did , and it brought me up to 2.0 .
in my case it was aunts who lived in all of these tenement buildings .
and we have to make sure that they are ready to be the majority .
i did it just last week . it was on a tuesday evening down by columbus circle .
and i would get harassed sometimes .
and i love this kind of random closeness , which is lucky , because i do a lot of couchsurfing .
and as usual , the band was psyched , but there was this one guy in the band who told me he just couldn 't bring himself to go out there .
so i fought my way off my label and for my next project with my new band , the grand theft orchestra , i turned to crowdfunding , and i fell into those thousands of connections that i 'd made , and i asked my crowd to catch me .
at the end of the night , i stripped and let everyone draw on me .
it turned out that the capability to collect data , information and connections about basically any of us and all of us is exactly what we 've been hearing throughout of the summer through revelations and leaks about western intelligence agencies , mostly u.s. intelligence agencies , watching over the rest of the world .
well , not exactly everyone , because the u.s. intelligence only has a legal right to monitor foreigners .
but now we do .
yet we have these files .
let 's take , for example , sweden .
yes , part of it is war on terror , and yes , there are terrorists , and they do kill and maim , and we should fight them , but we know through these leaks that they have used the same techniques to listen to phone calls of european leaders , to tap the email of residents of mexico and brazil , to read email traffic inside the united nations headquarters and e.u. parliament , and i don 't think they are trying to find terrorists from inside the e.u. parliament , right ?
privacy is nonnegotiable .
should we worry . no , we shouldn 't worry .
and i 'd like to tell you the story in three acts , and if i have time still , an epilogue .
or this painting , from the 1740s , from greenwich village .
this is richmond hill , and minetta water , which used to run its way through greenwich village .
we know that there was a lenape settlement down here by the collect pond .
here is the beaver . and here is the stream , and the aspen and the alder and the willow .
they are the connections that actually make nature resilient .
we can basically take a picture out of any window on manhattan and see what that landscape looked like 400 years ago .
and so many of the talks here at ted are about meaning , about bringing meaning to our lives in all kinds of different ways , through technology , through art , through science , so much so that i think we focus so much on that side of our lives , that we haven 't given enough attention to the food and the water and the shelter , and what we need to raise the kids .
and the girl 's going to notice me right here .
a total of seven guys enter anonymously in their underwear .
so i got inspired by that .
so i wrote this high school kid back immediately , and i said , " yes , you are correct .
and we were there probably 10 minutes before the managers decided to dial 911 .
and they 're going up these giant escalators on their way to their jobs .
as long as it 's fun and it seems like it 's going to be a funny idea and it seems like the people who witness it will also have a fun time , then that 's enough for us .
but i told him no , i 'm sorry , compromise in colors is gray , and we have enough gray to last us a lifetime .
" come on , man ! what policemen ?
it 's not about some being with a high conscience and some others having not a conscience .
it is about how people think , how they view the world around them , how they use their time and their energy .
so , welcome to the golden desert .
but now you can have this for year round .
but they can be opened for ted people .
these are all traditional water structures , which we won 't be able to explain in such a short time .
whether water level goes up or down , the beauty is there throughout .
it squeeze the moisture hidden in the sand .
they say that a picture is worth a thousand words , so we can say a thousand words right now , an another thousand words .
you can copy this tattoo . i have some posters of this .
thank you so much .
students lack perseverance .
and the textbook , i think , knows how it 's hamstringing students because , watch this , this is the practice problem set .
and then as we start to define what does steepness mean , we realize it would be nice to have some measurements to really narrow it down , specifically what that means .
so now we have a water tank .
but those conversations have been so valuable , among the most valuable .
thank you .
it 's a bit too big , and it hasn 't actually allowed these things like dynamic venture capital and commercialization to actually be able to really be as fruitful as it could .
and the point is that the internet was funded by darpa , u.s. department of defense .
innovation takes a much longer time than that , 15 to 20 years .
so what we have to actually do is build these entrepreneurial state organizations .
but also these companies that have actually had this massive benefit from the state -- apple 's a great example .
and americans love their chinese food so much they 've actually brought it into space .
theirs are actually flavored with miso and sesame paste , so they 're not as sweet as our version .
i went to his home town .
i like to say chop suey 's the biggest culinary joke that one culture has ever played on another , because chop suey , if you translate into chinese , means tsap sui , which , if you translate back , means " odds and ends . "
and as he said -- we would never print this today -- but basically , the american man has become very rich .
my personal favorite of all the restaurants i 've encountered around the world was this one in brazil , called " kung food . "
i went across the country , looking for these restaurants where these people had gotten their fortune cookies from .
i was really surprised to discover that , not only in philadelphia , but also in atlanta , because what had happened was that a chinese family had moved from atlanta to -- sorry , from philadelphia to atlanta , and brought that with them .
dh : right now ?
one of the ironies of this whole system is we 're discussing what to do about a system that we don 't understand . we don 't even know what oil is . we don 't know where oil comes from . i mean , literally , it 's still a source of debate what this black river of stuff is and where it comes from . the best assumption , and one of the best guesses in this stuff , is that this stuff comes out of this stuff , that these things absorb sunlight , rot under pressure for millions of years , and you get these black rivers .
think of the cell as a hardware . think of the genes as a software . and in the measure that you begin to think of life as code that is interchangeable , that can become energy , that can become food , that can become fiber , that can become human beings , that can become a whole series of things , then you 've got to shift your approach as to how you 're going to structure and deal and think about energy in a very different way .
we are the species called homo sapiens sapiens , and it 's important to remember that , in terms of our place in the world today and our future on planet earth .
we mark it with a gps fix , and we also take a digital photograph of the specimen , so we could essentially put it back on the surface , exactly where we found it .
and if you look north here , there 's a big river that flows into the lake that 's been carrying sediment and preserving the remains of the animals that lived there .
he had a scoliosis and therefore must have been looked after quite carefully by other female , and probably much smaller , members of his family group , to have got to where he did in life , age 12 .
the question now is , well , who are we ?
my father so appropriately put it , that " we are certainly the only animal that makes conscious choices that are bad for our survival as a species . "
the seeds from these trees also have spread by birds here and there nearby the soundproof walls of the city expressway that has been built around the 1988 olympics .
three : sinew used in the outer layer of the limb for maximum tension storage .
now , i am shooting a part of myself to you .
just to let you know , i do not have a lexicographical whistle .
and so , james murray could get a job on any dictionary today .
this is flat . look how many links there are in the actual entry : two !
when they find a word that 's not in the dictionary , they think , " this must be a bad word . " why ? it 's more likely to be a bad dictionary .
lexicography is really more about material science .
and i find an un-dictionaried word -- a word like " un-dictionaried , " for example -- in almost every book i read . what about newspapers ?
if this was the dictionary -- if this was the map of american english -- look , we have a kind of lumpy idea of florida , but there 's no california !
because i 'm going to the internet , which is where everybody goes .
if we get a bigger pan , then we can put all the words in .
they 're formed at the nanoscale , and they use proteins that are coded by the genetic level that allow them to build these really exquisite structures .
but it wasn 't until about 500 million years ago -- during the cambrian geologic time period -- that organisms in the ocean started making hard materials .
and i absolutely love the periodic table .
and by doing that , it allows the virus to express random protein sequences .
but it 's basically -- you can pull one out of a billion .
so i hope that i 've convinced you that there 's a lot of great , interesting things to be learned about how nature makes materials -- and taking it the next step to see if you can force , or whether you can take advantage of how nature makes materials , to make things that nature hasn 't yet dreamed of making .
there 's one from a consumer 's point of view -- where i was happy while experiencing design .
under " nirvana " they showed this constable painting .
true printed his own version of these signs .
i would definitely say that observing vik muniz ' " cloud " a couple of years ago in manhattan for sure made me happy , as well .
and then i found another list in one of my diaries that actually contained all the things that i thought i learned in my life so far .
thank you so much .
we had one government agency and one company aircraft operator say , you 're crazy , don 't do that , you 're going kill the guy .
once he was there , [ we ] let him go to experience what weightlessness was truly like .
maybe because these conventional notions of progress haven 't delivered big benefits in terms of happiness , there 's been an increased interest in recent years in happiness itself .
and yet it 's not clear what the relationship is between our use of this ability and our happiness .
even when they 're thinking about something they would describe as pleasant , they 're actually just slightly less happy than when they aren 't mind-wandering .
my hope is that over time , by tracking people 's moment-to-moment happiness and their experiences in daily life , we 'll be able to uncover a lot of important causes of happiness , and then in the end , a scientific understanding of happiness will help us create a future that 's not only richer and healthier , but happier as well .
i helped many people , but whenever someone really needed help , i never got there in time . we never got there .
we 're not interested in your help . " and he threw me out of the room .
so we have thousands of volunteers who are passionate about saving lives , and they 're spread all around , so whenever a call comes in , they just stop everything and go and run and save a life .
they ask me to meet . they wanted to meet with me .
i never even knew what tedmed was then .
but it looks like -- i 'm guessing -- that it 'll be about 60 percent of the room because that 's roughly the fraction of developed world population that have some sort of vision correction .
so , i 've now made eye glasses to my prescription .
and on this slide , i 'm basically explaining all the problems you have .
proteins are coming in now that basically pinch off this vesicle , making it separate from the rest of the membrane , and now clathrin is basically done with its job , and so proteins are coming in now — we 've covered them yellow and orange — that are responsible for taking apart this clathrin cage .
from our testing , we 've found that it only takes 15 minutes for a biologist who has never touched animation software before to create her first molecular animation of her own hypothesis .
palestinian we were told the wall would separate palestine from israel .
protester : this is a peaceful march .
in a village called wallajeh , which sits very close to jerusalem , the community was facing a very similar plight to budrus .
i 'm going to give you four specific examples -- and i 'm going to cover at the end -- about how a company called silk tripled their sales by doing one thing , how an artist named jeff koons went from being a nobody to making a whole bunch of money and having a lot of impact , to how frank gehry redefined what it meant to be an architect .
you use the distribution you get to sell more products .
now there are magazines about water .
the thing that 's going to decide what gets talked about , what gets done , what gets changed , what gets purchased , what gets built , is : is it remarkable ?
he lived in paris . last year he sold 10 million dollars ' worth of french bread .
it describes the desire of someone who 's obsessed to say , drive across tokyo to try a new ramen noodle place , because that 's what they do : they get obsessed with it .
those people who buy them on the website have the otaku , and then they tell their friends , and it spreads and it spreads .
the first one is : design is free when you get to scale .
and my big failure ? i came out with an entire record album and hopefully a whole bunch of record albums in sacd format -- this remarkable new format -- and i marketed it straight to people with 20,000-dollar stereos .
my work , for a long time , has been involved in education , in teaching people practical skills for sustainability , teaching people how to take responsibility for growing some of their own food , how to build buildings using local materials , how to generate their own energy , and so on .
already that 's fallen to about 11 .
there is the story of " the elves and the shoemaker . "
but we also live in a world with very real constraints and demands .
and it 's really about how systems , settlements , withstand shock from the outside .
and actually a lot of them are doing huge amounts of stuff .
and that 's certainly been my experience with transition .
because if we cling to it , and continue to assume that it can underpin our choices , the future that it presents to us is one which is really unmanageable .
so he injects the first guy , and then he 's wiping the needle on his shirt , and he injects the next guy .
so no surprises then that the proportion that actually used clean needles every time they injected in the last week is just about one in 10 , and the other nine in 10 are sharing .
and in all of those countries , you can see , not more than four percent of injectors ever became infected with hiv .
it 's not that easy !
in most of the world , these few prevention failures notwithstanding , we are actually doing quite well these days in commercial sex : condom use rates are between 80 and 100 percent in commercial sex in most countries .
now , am i saying , " oh , well , great prevention strategy .
it means we need to be doing more prevention the more treatment we have .
elizabeth pisani : " when you get to politics , nothing makes sense . "
the big opportunity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is actually in urbanizing the suburbs .
but that they 're really all market driven , and what 's driving the market in particular -- number one -- is major demographic shifts .
so this happens to be a dead mall in st. louis that 's been re-inhabited as art-space .
this is mashpee commons , the oldest retrofit that we 've found .
it 's now 22 walkable urban blocks with public streets , two public parks , eight bus lines and a range of housing types , and so it 's really given lakewood , colorado the downtown that this particular suburb never had .
you want to also try to get more systemic transformation .
but daylighting our creeks really improves their water quality and contributions to habitat .
they are new but trying to look old .
hiv isn 't like other medical conditions ; it 's stigmatizing .
so these programs -- and i 'm going to refer to pmtct though my talk -- these prevention programs , simply , they 're the tests and the drugs that we give to mothers to prevent them from infecting their babies , and also the medicines we give to mothers to keep them healthy and alive to raise their children .
that means doctors and nurses simply don 't have the time to take care of patients .
and the nurse takes you into a room , and she tells you about the tests and hiv and the medicines you can take and how to take care of yourself and your baby , and you hear none of it .
we bring mothers who have hiv , who 've been through these pmtct programs in the very facilities , to come back and work side by side with doctors and nurses as part of the health care team .
so how do we do it ?
we have the medicines , we have the tests , but how do you reduce the stigma ?
i am proof that there is hope .
they change the way communities think -- we need to change attitudes to hiv .
those who are hiv-infected must know how to take care of themselves .
that became , as it were , a way of confronting large businesses in the business of wasting food , and exposing , most importantly , to the public , that when we 're talking about food being thrown away , we 're not talking about rotten stuff , we 're not talking about stuff that 's beyond the pale .
we 've never had such gargantuan surpluses before .
strange you might think , but if we could rely on corporations to tell us what they were doing in the back of their stores , we wouldn 't need to go sneaking around the back , opening up bins and having a look at what 's inside .
this man , in kashgar , xinjiang province , in western china , is serving up his national dish .
i answered that question when i was 15 .
come with me to 915 south bloodworth street in raleigh , north carolina , where i grew up .
now , it was not always wonderful at that table .
and whatever we do to the web , we do to ourselves . "
because i had someone dear to me snatched away .
my faith has constantly lifted up the ideal , and challenged me when i fell beneath it .
we would decide to establish this charter of compassion .
and they 'll stand before god and family and some guy her dad once did business with , and they 'll vow that nothing , not abject poverty , not life-threatening illness , not complete and utter misery will ever put the tiniest damper on their eternal love and devotion .
for instance , in the happiest marriages , the wife is thinner and better looking than the husband .
the researchers were not looking at documented self-reports of childhood happiness or even studying old journals .
but here 's a scary one : divorce is contagious .
and we do like a cocktail or two .
as you remember , the apple ii did nothing at all .
it could show text and after we waited a bit , we had these things called images .
or fear like this , kind of a nightclub typeface .
and i 've been curious about how design and technology intersect , and i 'm going to show you some old work i never really show anymore , to give you a sense of what i used to do .
it 's peaceful , like that .
so they 'd go to an antique shop , and they 'd look at this cup , and they 'd say , " tell us about this cup . "
and what is that , structurally ?
let me show you something i haven 't shown anywhere , actually .
but then my father became president of mexico and my life changed .
the real problem we have is most of us mexicans , we believe we are victims of our circumstances .
we want to go on with our daily life even though we are not living under normal circumstances .
we need to move mexican society , the members of society who are at this level , to the next level , which is action .
they mobilized the whole community of le barón to go to chihuahua , where they organized a sit-in in the central park of the city .
i 've traveled a lot and nowhere else have i found the passion mexicans have .
but we are many more .
he said , " no ! it 's called " menu " , or " menu " . "
i didn 't want to judge him with the same cruelty that he judged me .
the germans , french , japanese and chinese , all these nations are aware of this .
what is our intellect ?
forget about this headache and go have fun . "
we are very cool !
you 'd be entering a virtual world with a virtual language .
and , you know , we open it up and i read the music .
i see that you 're clutching a teddy bear , etc . , etc .
and i said , " yes , i agree with that . so what 's the problem ? "
no circumstances at all were used to refuse any entry .
so there 's always , always that huge -- i mean , just this kaleidoscope of things to draw from .
those are hugely important aspects to think about .
now -- great imagination , thank you very much .
like that . and then we get a little faster and a little faster and a little faster .
the performer is in the worst possible position for the actual sound , because they 're hearing the contact of the stick on the drum , or the mallet on the bit of wood , or the bow on the string , etc . , or the breath that 's creating the sound from wind and brass .
and they explained that they wanted kind of a rube goldberg machine .
okay .
it doesn 't matter what temperature it is , doesn 't matter what 's in its way ; it will pretty much get where it needs to go .
months were spent in this tiny , cold warehouse .
you know you can 't keep letting it get you down and you can 't keep dragging that dead weight around if there ain 't all that much to lug around better run like hell when you hit the ground when the morning comes when the morning comes you can 't stop these kids from dancing why would you want to ? especially when you 're already getting yours cuz if your mind don 't move and your knees don 't bend well don 't go blaming the kids again when the morning comes when the morning comes when the morning comes when the morning comes when the morning comes when the morning comes let it go this too shall pass let it go this too shall pass you know you can 't keep letting it get you down no , you can 't keep letting it get you down let it go this too shall pass when the morning comes when the morning comes when the morning comes when the morning comes
in 1981 , we published an article in science magazine concluding that observed warming of 0.4 degrees celsius in the prior century was consistent with the greenhouse effect of increasing co2 .
i had been using the first line of the nasa mission statement , " to understand and protect the home planet , " to justify my talks .
that 's how much extra energy earth is gaining each day .
the physics does not change .
the texas , oklahoma , mexico heatwave and drought last year , moscow the year before and europe in 2003 , were all exceptional events , more than three standard deviations outside the norm .
this path , if continued , guarantees that we will pass tipping points leading to ice sheet disintegration that will accelerate out of control of future generations .
the members of the association are shocked to realize that it 's the poet samuel taylor coleridge , who hadn 't even left his house in years until that day .
i 'm sure we could all be that productive without facebook or twitter to take up our time .
the philosophical breakfast club changed that , working together .
they reinstated the tradition of the q & amp ; a after scientific papers were read , which had been discontinued by the royal society as being ungentlemanly .
darwin knew what we seem to have forgotten , that science is not only for scientists .
he 's barefoot . he 'll run back into his house , and he will contaminate his drinking water and his food and his environment with whatever diseases he may be carrying by fecal particles that are on his fingers and feet .
the flush toilet was voted the best medical advance of the last 200 years by the readers of the british medical journal , and they were choosing over the pill , anesthesia , and surgery .
poop can cook your dinner .
and this is where it gets really interesting , because it 's not that simple , because we are not simple .
she left .
they have in-built bidet nozzles for a lovely , hands-free cleaning experience , and they have various other features like a heated seat and an automatic lid-raising device which is known as the " marriage-saver . "
i don 't want you to see what i 'm doing up here .
and the success of it threw me for a loop .
and so i made a drawing with a fish , and i left japan .
and i made the object on the left for my show at the walker .
he was the swiss army knife .
and you can see , we started making a building together .
and it was all of one material , and the metal could go on the roof as well as the walls .
and when i was awarded the contract i , at the very beginning , asked the client if they would let stanley do a cameo piece with me .
we redid the side of the building and re-proportioned the windows so it sort of fit into the space .
and it reminded me why i play defensively in things like my house .
i keep trying to make it work .
it 's hard to do high-rise .
it 's up there .
and this is in anaheim , california , and it 's a freeway building .
these are the models for it .
it 's like a drug addict .
and i don 't gave good slides to show -- it 's just been completed -- but this piece here is this building , and these pieces here and here .
these are offices , which , really , in the competition , we didn 't have to design .
but you get the sense of the hall in section .
we cut them loose and made several bridges and created a kind of a foreground for this hotel .
we have half a million laptops today in the hands of children .
and so when i met with three children from the schools , who had traveled all day to come to bogota , one of the three children brought her mother .
you don 't vaccinate a few children .
he lost badly but every democrat does .
here is the same data on a map .
we 're going to drill down a little bit more now , into something called the general social survey .
and likewise they asked , not in 2000 , but in the same survey in 1996 , " would you not vote for a qualified black president ? "
literally there are people who might be in school in arkansas or tennessee and might never interact in a positive affirmative way with someone from another part of the country , or of another racial group .
people agree that paintings or movies or music are beautiful because their cultures determine a uniformity of aesthetic taste .
the other great principle of evolution is sexual selection , and it operates very differently .
this landscape type is regarded as beautiful , even by people in countries that don 't have it .
their symmetry , their attractive materials and , above all , their meticulous workmanship are simply quite beautiful to our eyes , even today .
is beauty in the eye of the beholder ?
and number two , obviously , this dependence upon the lesters is going to produce a subtle , understated , we could say camouflaged , bending to keep the lesters happy .
and number two , obviously , this dependence upon the funders produces a subtle , understated , camouflaged bending to keep the funders happy .
the corruption i 'm talking about is perfectly legal .
i can only find cheese . i 'm sorry . so there it is .
so it 's not that mine is the most important issue . it 's not .
you don 't wake up one day no longer a racist .
i 'm going off to build google glass .
and what we try to do in astronomy and cosmology is to go back before darwin 's simple beginning , to set our earth in a cosmic context .
each is a galaxy , fully like ours or andromeda , which looks so small and faint because its light has taken 10 billion light-years to get to us .
and so we need a theory that unifies the very large and the very small , which we don 't yet have .
and it 's this science , which is not only enlightening our understanding of the biological world , but also transforming our world faster than ever .
first , any scientific discovery has benign consequences as well as dangerous ones .
there 's an unthinking tendency to imagine that humans will be there , experiencing the sun 's demise , but any life and intelligence that exists then will be as different from us as we are from bacteria .
change has accelerated as human populations rose .
but to really see the details of the bee , and really appreciate what it is , you have to look a little bit closer .
so this whole world , the nano world , this area in here is called the nano world , and the nano world , the whole micro world that we see , there 's a nano world that is wrapped up within that , and the whole -- and that is the world of molecules and atoms .
you have bits of a volcano . there 's a little bit of a volcano there . you have tube worms .
and you can see those in micrometeorites .
this grain of sand is probably about three and a half or four billion years old , and it 's never eroded away like the way we have sand on earth erodes away because of water and tumbling , air , and so forth . all you can see is a little bit of erosion down here by the sun , has these solar storms , and that 's erosion by solar radiation .
edith widder : so i recorded that with an intensified video camera that has about the sensitivity of the fully dark-adapted human eye .
the light organs under the eyes are flashing .
it grows very slowly .
it 's got a brittle star hitching a ride .
we 're talking to something .
and that was a humboldt squid , a juvenile humboldt squid , about three feet long .
but i warn you , it 's addictive .
now , the human cost of that is obvious , once you start to think about it -- the suffering , the loss -- it 's also , economically , enormously wasteful .
similarly , the astronomer royal , whom we heard speak yesterday , also has a 50 percent probability estimate .
or an aesthetic experience -- a sunset or a great piece of art .
if we want to achieve this , what , in the world , would have to change ?
we are very ignorant about what the time scale for these things are , but they all are consistent with everything we know about physical laws , laws of chemistry , etc .
but we are just literally deaf to that kind of value .
there would be different modes of being you could experience if you were able to stay alive for , say , 200 years .
so it was on the 10th of june , and they came , and they surrounded the house , and my grandmother switched off all the lights in the house , and opened the kitchen door .
small roundabouts are starting to appear .
so , it makes one wonder , " why is it there ? "
so , now that you are all " road scholars " ...
it was a time when medicine was cheap and very ineffective .
we can 't guarantee that everybody will live a long and healthy life .
our experience as people who get sick , need help from other people , is that we have amazing clinicians that we can turn to -- hardworking , incredibly well-trained and very smart -- that we have access to incredible technologies that give us great hope , but little sense that it consistently all comes together for you from start to finish in a successful way .
and you put it all together and what do you get ?
i got interested in this when the world health organization came to my team asking if we could help with a project to reduce deaths in surgery .
we had the pause points immediately before anesthesia is given , immediately before the knife hits the skin , immediately before the patient leaves the room .
even the cowboys are pit crews now .
now , a hallmark of computer programs is just this kind of sensitivity to small changes .
and what happens if you water and feed that seed appropriately , is it will do a developmental computation , a molecular computation , and it 'll build an electronic computer .
so , i 'm going to start asking those questions for the dna structures i 'm going to talk about next .
each one has a left half that binds the long strand in one place , and a right half that binds it in a different place , and brings the long strand together like this .
there 's the atomic-force microscope working and you can see that the landing 's a little rough .
now , i want to get back to that compiler .
so you can read off binary numbers five , six and seven .
if we wanted to make a square of size 10 , 100 or 1,000 , if we used dna origami alone , we would require a number of dna strands that 's the square of the size of that square ; so we 'd need 100 , 10,000 or a million dna strands .
i want you to remember that to create life 's very diverse and complex forms , life uses computation to do that .
and that was a good thing to help , you know , the cause .
i don 't really -- i mean , i could tell you that i didn 't understand , i 'm not proud of it , but i didn 't understand let 's say 95 percent of the talks at this conference .
i can 't stand the idea of anything that starts in the beginning , you know , beginning , middle and end . it really scares me , because my life is too random and too confused , and i enjoy it that way .
and i didn 't -- and i 'd never used it in school , because i was too busy writing poems , and flunking out , and i don 't know what , sitting in cafes .
who knows ? the new york timesselect , the op-ed page , asked me to do a column , and they said , you can do whatever you want .
" and decided his top people had to be extinctified . "
and actually , he was . i think he 's dead , though i don 't know , maybe he 's not dead .
ok . i taped my -- my aunt used to swim in the ocean every day of the year until she was about 85 .
and i look at a beautiful bowl of fruit , and i look at a dress that i sewed for friends of mine .
and many of the questions that we might have about the universe at large scales , such as , how does gravity work ?
and dark matter is no exception .
so , one particular question that we have is , how does dark energy affect the universe at the largest scales ?
it 's in a shopping mall , and it sells fish eggs .
and it started to make me think about a couple of things .
and what will you be able to do with that sample ?
it 's very hard to know who needs to have information and who doesn 't .
it was the fundamental shift , not new tactics , not new weapons , not new anything else .
i knew them both .
so , for instance , in all of asia recently , it was impossible to get youtube for a little while because pakistan made some mistakes in how it was censoring youtube in its internal network .
and so there 's a lot of -- i 'm sure you 've read a lot in papers , about worries about cyberattacks and defenses against those .
and in fact , nobody really exactly understands all the things it 's being used for right now .
it could definitely be done by people in this room .
you can pay them a certain amount of money , they hire homeless people and others who need a job to stand waiting in the line for as long as it takes , and the lobbyist , just before the hearing begins , can take his or her place at the head of the line and a seat in the front of the room .
many schools struggle with the challenge of motivating kids , especially kids from disadvantaged backgrounds , to study hard , to do well in school , to apply themselves .
michael sandel : takes the intrinsic incentive away .
will they have learned that reading is a chore , a form of piecework to be done for pay , that 's the worry , or may it lead them to read maybe for the wrong reason initially but then lead them to fall in love with reading for its own sake ?
here 's why .
it 's this pervasiveness , combined with the centrality to what it means to be a human , the fact that we can tell the truth or make something up , that has fascinated people throughout history .
you weren 't in a dead zone .
chinese water army refers to thousands of people in china that are paid small amounts of money to produce content . it could be reviews . it could be propaganda . the government hires these people , companies hire them , all over the place .
you know , we always think that hey , there are these idealized versions , people are just showing the best things that happened in their lives . i 've thought that many times .
they are clustering pretty close to the truth . what we found was 80 percent of our participants did indeed lie on one of those dimensions , but they always lied by a little bit .
most linguists agree that we started speaking somewhere between 50,000 and 100,000 years ago . that 's a long time ago .
i 'll give you a moment to read through them .
this isn 't a deception-detection machine to tell if your girlfriend 's lying to you on text messaging .
so with this focus on cost-cutting , i asked myself , are we forgetting the patient ?
you compare hospitals in a country , you 'll find some that are extremely good , but you 'll find a large number that are vastly much worse .
so they in fact spent two years debating , " so what is quality in hip surgery ? "
so many unnecessary surgeries , and so much unnecessary suffering for all the patients who were operated on in that seven year period .
they will share the information on how to improve .
can we measure it better than we do ?
you see there , it 's about 620 billion a year .
what 's beautiful is , you can probably see on the limb there some faint , sort of , wisps of almost smoke rising up from the limb .
it could be hundreds of kilometers deep , we think .
so exploration can pay for itself .
now , that sounds esoteric , and indeed it was an esoteric pursuit , but the quantum theory quickly led to an understanding of the behaviors of electrons in materials like silicon , for example .
now that 's an incredible phenomena , because it 's a star that sits there .
it was taken by the cassini space probe .
on it , everyone you love , everyone you know , everyone you 've ever heard of , every human being who ever was lived out their lives .
imagine that we build an enclosure where we put it just underwater , and we fill it with wastewater and some form of microalgae that produces oil , and we make it out of some kind of flexible material that moves with waves underwater , and the system that we 're going to build , of course , will use solar energy to grow the algae , and they use co2 , which is good , and they produce oxygen as they grow .
and the system is contained . what do i mean by that ?
but this is a bit like putting your head in a plastic bag .
unless you look at the system as a way to treat waste water , sequester carbon , and potentially for photovoltaic panels or wave energy or even wind energy , and if you start thinking in terms of integrating all of these different activities , you could also include in such a facility aquaculture .
i think there is almost no limit to what we can accomplish if we are radically open and we don 't care who gets the credit .
and the idea was to have me record some of my poems and then they would find animators to animate them .
i watch it sniffing the paper ceaselessly , intent as any forager that has nothing on its mind but the grubs and insects that will allow it to live another day .
the next poem is called forgetfulness , and it 's really just a kind of poetic essay on the subject of mental slippage .
narration : " the country . "
i mean , we had the wheel for some time .
thanks .
we might one day see a shadow a black hole can cast on a very bright background , but we haven 't yet .
this is the hardworking scientist under harsh conditions .
so you can 't hide anything behind a black hole .
and they travel out into the cosmos at the speed of light .
now i 've never heard it that loud -- it 's actually more dramatic .
there 's also a mission proposed for space , which hopefully will launch in the next ten years , called lisa .
imagine a billion years ago , two black holes collided .
or , is it possible that we 're just a branch off of a multiverse -- each branch with its own big bang in its past -- maybe some of them with black holes playing drums , maybe some without -- maybe some with sentient life , and maybe some without -- not in our past , not in our future , but somehow fundamentally connected to us ?
pr : we haven 't prepared anything .
so you have a rush of adrenaline , your heart rate increases , your breathing gets faster .
and i remember it really well , because i don 't have a lot of epiphanies .
together with the architects of albert speer & amp ; partner , our engineers from transsolar have been supporting , have been developing open-air stadia based on 100 percent solar power , on 100 percent solar cooling .
and this is air temperature .
there are 12 stadia probably to come , but there are 32 training pitches where all the individual countries are going to train .
we uploaded a very simple perceived temperature calculator where you can check out about your outdoor comfort .
and the talmud saw this a long time ago , saying , " we see things not as they are , but as we are . "
but then i had a thought of , " boy , maybe it 's too simple . "
and what this teacher did on every project was to have the children act like first it was a creative arts project , and then something like science .
each time i click it , car turn .
we get a visual pattern of what these nine-year-olds called acceleration .
so what i 'm doing is measuring from the bottom of one image to the bottom of the next image , about a fifth of a second later , like that . and they 're getting faster and faster each time , and if i stack these guys up , then we see the differences ; the increase in the speed is constant .
and einstein said , " things should be as simple as possible , but not simpler . "
but one other extremely unique thing about bats is that they are able to use sound to perceive their environment . they use echolocation .
bats are usually synonymous with some type of evil events .
well , it has been calculated that if we were to remove bats from the equation , we 're going to have to then use insecticides to remove all those pest insects that feed on our agricultural crops .
so say , for example , the region of the genome that i was looking at was a region that 's important for vision .
some ? how about 30 ?
i just wish it were more organized . "
one , two , three .

well , it can mean a lot of things .
they manufacture plastics . they use large quantities chloroprene and benzene .
so , how many people are in the white ?
this is how paul did it . he did it with his iphone .
and i would say he got it right almost a decade ago .
is what we are here to do in medicine , is what everyone should do .
so , steven is sharing this story , but he is not alone .
i love some of these , physical exercise , prayer .
the blue band is the 50th percentile . steven is the 75th percentile , that he has non-genetic als .
and if anyone 's ever had severe constipation , and you don 't understand how much of an impact that has on your life -- yes , that was a pun .
because the blue line is a better line . the red line is way downhill , the blue line is a good line .
and i said , " what if we built a time machine for patients , except instead of going backwards , we go forwards .
you can see here , the blue dots on the top , the light ones , those are the people in the study in pnas that you wanted to be on . and the red ones are the ones , the pink ones on the bottom are the ones you didn 't want to be .
and some of them were available . so , we hired one .
there is an amazing journey we are going on to become human again , to be part of community again , to share of ourselves , to be vulnerable , and it 's very exciting . so , thank you .
last one , this is " who 's going to buy you ribbons , " another traditional folk tune .
progress happens when all the factors that make for it are ready and then it is inevitable . "
i 'm only exaggerating a little bit . it 's a broad patent .
is this promoting the progress of useful arts ?
i 'm going to talk about how they 're useful when we reflect , learn , remember and want to improve .
the rest of it is the bedside console ; just for reference , this is a sleep tracking system from just a few years ago -- i mean , really until now .
you have to make a wish to save the world . "
it was like leaving our mark on society , to say , " i was here , " on the top of a building .
i mean , these were the faces of my friends .
so we decided to take portraits of palestinians and israelis doing the same jobs -- taxi-driver , lawyer , cooks .
we 're in ramallah right now .
so i decided to go further in this direction and go in places where there were zero museums .
and she said , " you know what ?
and on that stairs , that 's where the traffickers always stand and there 's a lot of exchange of fire .
or they tell you , " are these people all dead ? "
when you look at kibera now , they look back .
and the photos kept traveling even without us .
and i was even invited to cover the moca museum .
in some ways , art can change the world .
so i hope that , together , we 'll create something that the world will remember .
so this is telling us that the fermentation is in full swing .
i can make it change color without using dye by a process of iron oxidation .
and in fact , we could make it from a waste stream -- so for example , a waste sugar stream from a food processing plant .
and that tool is very simply , as chris suggested , looking at us and the world from the plants ' or the animals ' point of view .
the bee is not calling the shots .
get us to do things that leads to the support and perpetuation of the biota , rather than its destruction ?
you know , we went into it thinking , 40,000 or 50,000 human genes and we came out with only 23,000 .
it 's permaculture , those of you who know a little bit about this , such that the cows and the pigs and the sheep and the turkeys and the ...
and within four or five weeks , he can do it again .
here , all this food comes off this farm , and at the end of the season there is actually more soil , more fertility and more biodiversity .
and if you think about it , all of the weird weather we 've been having the last few years , much of that is due to just one degree warming , and we need co2 emissions to peak by the end of this decade globally and then come down .
can i pay the bills at the end of the month ?
so think about that .
yields increase , and you halve the input costs .
some things are certain , i think .
but it 's not just as simple as making sure there 's no child labor .
be a discerning consumer .
you can see the united states and california and san diego , and you can use the mouse or the keyboard to spin things around .
well , a lot of what nasa does is robotic exploration , and we have a lot of spacecraft out there .
and i 'm going to recenter the camera on saturn , here .
thank you .
now , since you guys are really great , maybe you can humor me and say this all together too .
i didn 't ask you to chant it because it 's true ; i just want you to remember it .
and you can see that the green neuron touches the red neuron at two locations , and these are what are called synapses .
just as one strand of spaghetti contacts many other strands on your plate , one neuron touches many other neurons through their entangled branches .
and indeed , these days i harbor new hopes .
and there 's a lot of evidence that neural activity can cause your connections to change .
suppose our technologies for finding connectomes actually work .
i estimate , millions of miles , all packed in your skull .
i 've described a quest that begins in the world of the very small , and propels us to the world of the far future .
imagine this scenario .
these are able to transport two kilograms over 10 kilometers in just about 15 minutes .
imagine if your life depended on this package , somewhere in africa or in new york city , after sandy .
we are living through an amazing urbanization trend .
arguably the financial markets have failed us and the aid system is failing us , and yet i stand firmly with the optimists who believe that there has probably never been a more exciting moment to be alive .
even more problematic , they 're not listening to poor people themselves .
at the same time amitabha was obsessed with this drip irrigation technology that had been invented in israel .
and while , again , you needed patience to move a technology for the poor in india into pakistan , just to get the permits , over time we were able to start a company with dr. sono , who runs a large community development organization in the thar desert , which is one of the remote and poorest areas of the country .
when we think about new approaches to aid , it 's impossible not to talk about pakistan .
because one of the poorest farmers on earth had gotten access to a technology that had allowed him to change his own life .
i know it works .
for a kid at that age , this was like infinite speed , disappearing , and i was very inspired by that .
i only get to fly this vehicle occasionally , and only when i can persuade my stockholders to let me do so , but it 's still one of those wonderful experiences that reward you for all that time .
after all , i 've been spending 60 years here believing it 's going to happen tomorrow .
but the vehicle itself is going to be a very , very controlled environment .
a vertical-takeoff aircraft , like the hummingbird , has a very high metabolism , which means it requires a lot of energy .
the parachutes are there -- hopefully , more for psychological than real reasons , but they will be an ultimate backup if it comes to that .
thank you .
now in the old days , that meant getting out a volume and browsing through it alphabetically , maybe getting sidetracked , that was fun .
that means the next time you are in the grocery store , take a look at the four people ahead of you in line .
i do like sympathy . i do like magic .
i click on him , and i really thought he was going to bring me full circle twice , in fact .
i 'm pretty sure my dad doesn 't know it .
it is that simple .
she lands months before the beatles release " the white album , " months before martin luther king was killed .
and i was on the cusp of , sort of , adolescence , so i was starting to take biscuits from the tin without asking .
for doing this , i was incarcerated for a year in an assessment center which was actually a remand center . it was a virtual prison for young people .
in creativity i saw light .
it would be several months before this infant could do something as simple as reach out and grasp under voluntary control an object and retrieve it , usually to the mouth .
and in fact they result in a wonderful differentiation in humankind , in the way that , in fact , no two of us are quite alike .
i can raise an animal under conditions that would be equivalent to raising a baby under a moderately loud ceiling fan , in the presence of continuous noise .
so here is a very simple experiment .
these are the surfaces the monkey is using to manipulate the tool .
the changes are massive .
i 'm going to talk about using these strategies to actually design brain plasticity-based approach to drive corrections in the machinery of a child that increases the competence of the child as a language receiver and user and , thereafter , as a reader .
every sound the child hears uncorrected is muffled .
of course they will . because as a receiver of language , they are receiving it and representing it , and in information it 's representing crap .
think of a classroom of children in the language arts .
it means that most people who are at risk for senility , more or less immediately , are now in a protected position .
this material actually has some traits that make it seem almost too good to be true .
and then we use this to do a variety of things -- like , for example , this film .
and so the material can assume a lot of formats .
so there 's versatility , as you see , in the material formats , that you can do with silk .
or you could put drugs in your wallet and not in your fridge .
and for the next three decades , i was on and off various diets .
dr. rudy leibel of columbia university has found that people who have lost 10 percent of their body weight burn 250 to 400 calories less because their metabolism is suppressed .
children are especially vulnerable to this cycle of dieting and then binging .
if i 've convinced you that dieting might be a problem , the next question is , what do you do about it ?
our daughters have learned to measure their worth by the wrong scale .
that is the equivalent of what we face now .
what 's wrong with you people on the other side in the other party ?
as you see , temples and gods play a big role in all ancient civilizations .
it used to be that conservatives and moderates and liberals could all work together in congress .
it plummets . something is going on here .
so there are a lot of reforms we could do that will counteract this .
this is where we are as a country .
now let me be clear . i 'm not blaming the women here .
in the asteroids club , we don 't start by looking for common ground .
organic chemists make molecules , very complicated molecules , by chopping up a big molecule into small molecules and reverse engineering .
say a new super bug has emerged .
and so i was surprised when i noticed one day that the conservatives had disappeared from my facebook feed .
so it 's not just google and facebook either .
it gives us a little bit of justin bieber and a little bit of afghanistan .
but we really need you to make sure that these algorithms have encoded in them a sense of the public life , a sense of civic responsibility .
and he begins to move beyond his self-concern into the broader concern for others .
and the man said , " really ? " and he showed him a dish full of needles .
so , he takes it to some water . he 's about to clean , but then his awareness focuses on the maggots .
but , being human , he 's immediately thinking of his next complaint .
a famous one , it 's called the " sevenfold causal method of developing compassion . "
a theist christian can think that all beings , even my enemies , are god 's children .
and this is the way you do it . you take any being who looks weird to you , and you see how they could be familiar to you .
he does say that , and we think he 's being unrealistic and sort of spiritual and highfalutin . " nice for him to say it , but i can 't do that . "
and the more they succeed and the more power they have , the more unhappy they are .
one thing we mustn 't think is that compassion makes you miserable .
it 's simply accelerating the pace at which the body heals itself to a clinically relevant timescale .
and you can basically see that the richer a country is , the older the people are within it .
they don 't actually change what the actual cost of the treatment is .
there 's a limb prosthetic up here , similar actually one on the soldier that 's come back from iraq .
therefore , if we can find the right cells and implant them in the body , they may do the healing .
this is an older lady . she has cancer of the liver as well as diabetes , and has decided to die with what ' s left of her body intact .
this is clinically relevant today .
just a little bit of data , a tiny bit of data .
i talked before about the use of devices to dramatically change the way we treat disease .
almost every field of science engineering and clinical practice is involved in trying to get this to happen .
thank you .
it 's also the very first letter of the word shalan , which means " something " just like the the english word " something " -- some undefined , unknown thing .
the more stuff that 's mine , the better .
the good news is we are starting to recover materials from our end-of-life stuff and starting to recycle our end-of-life stuff , particularly in regions of the world like here in europe that have recycling policies in place that require that this stuff be recycled in a responsible manner .
people , for as little as a dollar a day , pick through our stuff .
this is the last frontier of recycling .
it starts with metal recyclers who shred our stuff into very small bits .
and these are just a few examples of companies that are buying our plastic , replacing virgin plastic , to make their new products .
nobel prize nominee hernando de soto recognized that the key to economic liftoff for most developing countries is to tap the vast amounts of uncapitalized land .
in the last 20 years , people have realized that science has a tremendous amount to do with food .
one is you can actually explain what happens when you steam broccoli .
the new york times ran a piece after my book was delayed and it was called " the wait for the 30-hour hamburger just got longer . "
we used a red , very high-temperature silicon to do that .
but now you will ; we put a biography of james watt in .
this is the 30-hour hamburger .
2,438 pages .
but even so , there was one thing that everyone was certain of : the expansion must be slowing down .
this number is small .
and you can think about those as height , width and depth .
because you see , if there are other universes , and if those universes each have , say , a different shape for the extra dimensions , then the physical features of each universe will be different , and in particular , the amount of dark energy in each universe will be different .
instead the right question to ask is , why do we humans find ourselves on a planet at this particular distance , instead of any of the other possibilities ?
each of these universes has extra dimensions .
or would they believe in the black , static empty universe that their own state-of-the-art observations reveal ?
you 're going to be around for the next few days .
one day in new york , i was on the street and i saw some kids playing baseball between stoops and cars and fire hydrants .
and the pitches , the notes , as you know , are just vibrations .
and from this moment , classical music became what it most essentially is , a dialogue between the two powerful sides of our nature : instinct and intelligence .
and the chords , it turned out , were capable of representing incredible varieties of emotions .
i find it such a profound one .
now that we have unlimited access to music , what does stick with us ?
if you 're curious , if you have a capacity for wonder , if you 're alive , you know all that you need to know .
but it would have done so at a price to hundreds of patients who , like celine , were left to their own devices once the research had been completed .
local communities need to be more involved in establishing the criteria for recruiting participants in clinical trials , as well as the incentives for participation .
now , fortunately for celine , our meeting did not end in my office .
when we learn of tribal practices , some of them will horrify us , but there are other tribal practices which , when we hear about them , we may admire and envy and wonder whether we could adopt those practices ourselves .
another traditional usefulness of older people is that they are capable of babysitting their grandchildren , thereby freeing up their own adult children , the parents of those grandchildren , to go hunting and gathering food for the grandchildren .
ads for coca-cola and beer always depict smiling young people , even though old as well as young people buy and drink coca-cola and beer .
conversely , i at age 75 am incompetent at skills essential for everyday life .
the remaining value of older people that i 'll mention involves recognizing that while there are many things that older people can no longer do , there are other things that they can do better than younger people .
features of the modern lifestyle predispose us to those diseases , and features of the traditional lifestyle protect us against them .
but our current funeral practices make the situation much worse .
i realize this is not the kind of relationship that we usually aspire to have with our food .
accepting death means accepting that we are physical beings who are intimately connected to the environment , as the research on environmental toxins confirms .
forty years later , this group , more than most , are well aware of the destructive power that our species can wield over our environment .
she , better than most , knew the power of an image .
and thank you to all the photographers .
literature allowed him to transcend his surroundings .
he then ran twice for the senate , lost twice .
and he , pointing to the proclamation , said , " i believe , in this measure , my fondest hopes will be realized . "
so as for that second sphere , not of work , but of love -- encompassing family , friends and colleagues -- it , too , takes work and commitment .
so i think that part of his attraction for me was that i loved listening to his tall tales .
as his spirits sagged , his body deteriorated until , i believe , he slowly brought about his own death .
and so they said , " well , did you see george washington in there ? "
when you are brought up as a catholic , you think that if you ever set foot in a protestant church , you 'll be struck dead at the threshold .
" oh yes , " i said .
her name is pam moran in albemarle county , virginia , the foothills of the blue ridge mountains .
and so they pleaded with me to get a degree in something .
this film is called " world peace and other 4th grade achievements . "
i didn 't use that stare very often , but i do have it in my repertoire .
so i thought , well they like to play games .
there 's oil spills , environmental disasters , water rights disputes , breakaway republics , famine , endangered species and global warming .
and i admit the truth to them right up front : i don 't know .
we were all upset with her , " why are you doing this ?
you have to write a letter to their parents -- the fictional parents of your fictional troops -- explaining what happened and offering your condolences .
and so i 've been winning battles , so i 'm going into battles , more battles .
i should have gotten it so they could have won .
spontaneous compassion that could not be planned for , that was unexpected and unpredictable .
so , that 's what i want to talk about today .
and it 's -- in the most schematic possible view , it 's a coordination problem , right ?
right ? we 've created a professional class of photographers whose goal is to go out and photograph the mermaid parade , or whatever else they 're sent out to photograph .
it 's mathematically true , but it doesn 't really talk about anything important -- because in these systems , the average isn 't really what matters .
and that sounds strange to our ears , but what ends up happening is that 80 percent of the contributors have contributed a below-average amount .
when you 're dealing with the left-hand edge of one of these distributions , when you 're dealing with the people who spend a lot of time producing a lot of the material you want , that 's an institution-as-enabler world .
we hired this programmer , he came in , he drank our cokes and played foosball for three years and he had one idea .
and i use that word advisedly .
pro-ana , the pro-ana groups .
the printing press precipitated 200 years of chaos , moving from a world where the catholic church was the sort of organizing political force to the treaty of westphalia , when we finally knew what the new unit was : the nation state .
we have focused on the worst-case scenario .
and indeed , we were so successful at producing certain types of stuff that we destroyed a lot of europe , and we had to rebuild it afterwards .
and we created , at the organization that i work for , the new economics foundation , something we call the happy planet index , because we think people should be happy and the planet should be happy .
now , there 's a huge array of nations around that global average .
what 's going on there ?
and so in strict happy-planet methodology , we 've become less efficient at turning our ultimate scarce resource into the outcome we want to .
now that 's all very easy to draw graphs and things like that , but the point is we need to turn those curves .
and the point of these is they are , not quite , the secrets of happiness , but they are things that i think happiness will flow out the side from .
you can do an experiment where you give two groups of people a hundred dollars in the morning .
politics have defined our lives .
from the fact that they are only serving one audience , mainly the western culture .
and i fell into a life in exile .
this film tried to find a balance between telling a political story , but also a feminine story .
and it 's a great honor to be an iranian woman and an iranian artist , even if i have to operate in the west only for now .
so , for us , seeing color is one of the simplest things the brain does .
they are identical in every single way .
beau lotto : " what are you reading ? " half the letters are missing . right ?
can i have the lights up again ?
whereas on the right , the information is consistent with those two tiles being under the same light .
yes ? raise your hand if you got that . yes ?
and now , in this experiment they get rewarded if they go to the blue flowers .
so how can we take this incredible capacity of plasticity of the brain and get people to experience their world differently ?
what this suggests is that no one is an outside observer of nature . okay ?
do they look the same ? no .
at this level of the labor market , what you need is a marketplace for spare hours .
and they 'll then decide when to do their street interviews .
basically classified adverts with a search facility .
there is a precedent for technology-enabled service that has been initiated by politicians in multiple countries and has been hugely successful : national lotteries .
it 's about deregulating some sectors so that local people can enter them .
should they be looking at other sectors ?
and she said , " but this is cnn , so you only get a sound bite . "
and because , quite rightly , they were saying psychology is about finding what 's wrong with you . spot the loony .
no one works on that .
they don 't sit in seminars on saturday morning .
but the pleasant life has three drawbacks , and it 's why positive psychology is not happy-ology and why it doesn 't end here .
contrary to what psychology told us about the bottom 50 percent of the human race in positive affectivity , i think len is one of the happiest people i know .
what you get out of that is not smiley-ness .
now , ok , you can open your eyes .
which is to say , the full life -- the sum is greater than the parts , if you 've got all three .
so in conclusion , the eleventh reason for optimism , in addition to the space elevator , is that i think with technology , entertainment and design , we can actually increase the amount of tonnage of human happiness on the planet .
well it 's 150 times more resistant to electric current than that salt dough .
what happens if i put in lots of lights and then add a motor ?
but some years ago i was on an elevator in philadelphia , coming down .
but this is not the first time that we 've had a technological revolution .
where does it come from ?
jesus said , " for out of the heart come evil thoughts : murders , sexual immorality , theft , false testimonies , slander . "
it 's the part of you that yearns , really , for god .
writing the oldest book in the world was job , and he said , " man is born unto trouble as the sparks fly upward . "
the final problem that david knew he could not solve was death .
there 's a time to be born , and there 's a time to die .
the reality of this life and his resurrection is the hope of mankind . "
pascal came to believe not only the love and the grace of god could bring us back into harmony , but he believed that his own sins and failures could be forgiven , and that when he died he would go to a place called heaven .
can you imagine that ? " i am the truth .
" come to visit the children ?
actually , not that long ago .
now let me put it this way : if i met a monolingual dutch speaker who had the cure for cancer , would i stop him from entering my british university ?
but i am against using it as a barrier .
okay .
a simple idea , but it could have such far-reaching consequences .
in order to provide the kind of energy that it would take for eight billion people living in cities that are even somewhat like the cities that those of us in the global north live in today , we would have to generate an absolutely astonishing amount of energy .
so you can think of it as tent poles that actually raise the density of the entire city .
what we 're finding is that what we want is access to the capacities of things .
and certainly lots of people have taken to heart this idea that a sustainable city is covered in greenery .
at camp diva , my non-profit organization , we have these types of conversations all the time as a way to help girls of african descent prepare for their passage into womanhood .
that 's worse than not having him here at all . "
even the guards cried .
we know that there are these varroa mites that have introduced and caused a lot of losses , and we also have this new phenomenon , which i talked about last year , colony collapse disorder .
it comes in the mail ; it can come from australia or hawaii or florida , and you can introduce that queen .
he 's the one who first identified this condition and raised the alarm bells .
and although i highly encourage you , all use honey .
now , that could be because we haven 't been sampling right , but it does , i think , suggest that something 's wrong with the pollinator force . and these bees are fascinating .
but i 'm glad to say that i think we know the cause of all these conditions , and that cause is ndd : nature deficit disorder .
you never run out of that companion as you drink this wine , too .
because so much of that book was a celebration of the power and creative potential of density , of largely urban density , of connecting people and putting them together in one place , and putting them on sidewalks together and having them share ideas and share physical space together .
i mean , the power of the city -- we talked about cities as being centralized in space , but what makes them so strong most of the time is they 're decentralized in function .
and the old one looked like this .
he 's analyzed basically all the weblogs out there that he 's tracking .
and i 'm saying a lot of nice things about google , so i 'll be i 'll be saying one little critical thing .
so dennett 's in the lead a little bit there .
i 'll go very quickly .
and it creates a kind of planned emergence .
how do we bring up boys ? what does it mean to be a boy ?
it is estimated that somewhere between 300,000 and 500,000 women have been raped there .
to pretend they 're not a mess when they are a mess .
the state of girls , the condition of girls , will , in my belief -- and that 's the girl inside us and the girl in the world -- determine whether the species survives .
it 's my baby and it 's full of love . "
she 's changed the rules .
when her father saw her and saw who she had become , in her full girl self , he threw his arms around her and broke down crying .
this is for her : i love being a girl .
i rejoice that it 's still in my body .
and i love , hear me , i love , love , love being a girl .
for a time that i find to be the most placid and uneventful hour of the day , four in the morning sure gets an awful lot of bad press -- across a lot of different media from a lot of big names .
where was wislawa szymborska during all this ?
i said , i know a coded message when i see one .
in generations .
he said you needed addition and subtraction .
but actually , the machine i 'm going to tell you about , the institute for advanced study machine , which is way up there , really should be down there . so , i 'm trying to revise history , and give some of these guys more credit than they 've had .
this is a letter from the director , concerned about -- " especially unfair on the matter of sugar . "
the " graph 'g-beam turn on . " this next slide , that 's the -- as far as i know -- the first digital bitmap display , 1954 .
" damn it , i can be just as stubborn as this thing . "
i know when i 'm licked . "
even errors were duplicated .
it wasn 't any sort of creator intelligence , but the thing itself was a giant parallel computation that would have some intelligence .
when juan enriquez told us about these 12 trillion bits being transferred back and forth , of all this genomics data going to the proteomics lab , that 's what barricelli imagined : that this digital code in these machines is actually starting to code -- it already is coding from nucleic acids .
and that 's my new life .
but of course , then the ball hits the other side , the ripples hit the -- poor fish , they can 't find any peace and quiet .
it said , " you know , this is a car that has lots of faults .
she brought students in to solve problems .
you get a little problem , you say , " ah , i 'll figure it out . "
i 'm walking around the stage -- i 'm not attending to the control of my legs .
on top of that , it communicates , which is what emotion does .
or an expensive watch , so you can impress people -- " oh gee , i didn 't know you had that watch . "
apologies to hans rosling -- he said anything that 's not using real stats is a lie -- but the big delta there is how we deal with this from a public standpoint .
our reality right now is less interesting than the story we 're going to tell about it later .
so all the way over on the left of this graph , what you see is many oecd countries saving over a quarter of their gdp every year , and some oecd countries saving over a third of their gdp per year .
now , that fascinated me endlessly as a child , but what fascinates me even more today as an economist is that some of these same differences carry through to how languages speak about time .
if that 's true and it makes the future feel like something more distant and more different from the present , that 's going to make it harder to save .
so for example , there is the survey of health , [ aging ] and retirement in europe .
now effectively everything i 'm going to tell you from now on is only comparing these basically nearly identical families .
thank you very much .
now there 's only a small part of the population , which remains unaffected .
cancer is a disease that affects millions of people around the world every year .
so i took this opportunity to collect some samples from jonas ' tumor and also some samples from other parts of his body .
but if this can happen in tasmanian devils , why hasn 't it happened in other animals or even humans ?
ad he decided to put this to the test by actually deliberately inoculating people with cancer from somebody else .
music must be the thing for derek .
now , along -- derek and i met when he was four and a half years old , and at first , derek , i thought you were mad , to be honest , because when you played the piano , you seemed to want to play every single note on the keyboard , and also you had this little habit of hitting me out of the way .
those of you who can see will know how many notes , but derek , of course , can 't .
ao : fantastic . well done , derek .
dp : he played " chopsticks . " ao : and played " chopsticks . "
i 'm not going to talk about " the skeptical environmentalist " -- probably that 's also a good choice .
the obvious question would be to ask , what do you think are the biggest things ?
of course , you have to ask yourself , why on earth was such a list never done before ?
what can we do ? what will be the cost and what will be the benefit of that ?
of course , you can also see it on the website , and we 'll also talk about it more , i 'm sure , as the day goes on .
so the guy in bangladesh who gets a flood in 2100 can wait until 2106 .
we could avoid about 500,000 people dying , but perhaps more importantly , we could avoid about a [ million ] people getting infected every year .
so again , what we focus on is prevention rather than treatment , at first rate .
or do we want to help real poor people , right now , in bangladesh , who really need the help , and whom we can help very , very cheaply ?
if any one of you guys can talk bush into doing that , that 's fine .
to start thinking about saying , " let 's do not the things where we can do very little at a very high cost , not the things that we don 't know how to do , but let 's do the great things where we can do an enormous amount of good , at very low cost , right now . "
life is a right , not collateral or casual .
it preps you . it aims you .
i live cycles of light and darkness .
one woman no longer believes love will ever find her .
do not fear what has blown up .
the real key observation he made is that a free-flying wing can sweep through more sky and generate more power in a unit of time than a fixed-wing turbine .
that would be enough to power your cell phone .
at that moment , we transcend space and time together .
all right . let 's start with theater .
zero is zero , a little hero of the 21st century , and zero can touch so many more people than i possibly could .
it 's information .
but that 's not what i want to talk to you about , because right now there are some really extraordinary things that we are doing with stem cells that are completely changing the way we look and model disease , our ability to understand why we get sick , and even develop drugs .
and stem cells really have given us the black box for diseases , and it 's an unprecedented window .
there 's a wonderful drug , and a class of drugs actually , but the particular drug was vioxx , and for people who were suffering from severe arthritis pain , the drug was an absolute lifesaver , but unfortunately , for another subset of those people , they suffered pretty severe heart side effects , and for a subset of those people , the side effects were so severe , the cardiac side effects , that they were fatal .
twelve years ago , i founded zipcar .
and it also delivers really fabulous innovation , and i 'll talk about that later .
building these platforms for participation are so nontrivial to do .
the reservations start coming in , and here , owners who were getting text messages and emails that said , " hey , joe wants to rent your car for the weekend .
so you can have these really nice things that can 't happen , and it 's a kind of " wow ! " and i want to say " wow ! "
this is a turquoise lake .
some people say happiness is right now ; it 's the quality of the freshness of the present moment .
now , what , then , will be happiness ?
that very sentence already reveals the doom of destruction of happiness .
so we may consider that the more those are invading our mind , and , like a chain reaction , the more we feel miserable , we feel tormented .
but you cannot , at the same time , toward the same object , the same person , want to harm and want to do good .
but that 's the only way to go .
of course , during the training , we do that with objects .
it 's more to say that mind training matters . that this is not just a luxury .
" know thyself . "
think of the term we use , " retreat . "
you 're actually looking inside my head as i speak .
we brought to life a vast array of prototypes and products that you could control with your mind , like thought-controlled home appliances or slot car games or video games or a levitating chair .
here 's an application that i created for the ipad .
it 's how we understand the world inside and reflect it outside into this tight loop .
do you know what causes fatigue in you or what brings out your energetic self , what triggers cause you to be depressed or what fun things are going to bring you out of that funk ?
thank you .
okay , let me give you one example of the kinds of experiments that people do , and it 's in the area of what you 'd call valuation .
let me give you an example of this .
one area is called experimental economics . the other area is called behavioral economics .
these kinds of probes exploit it . okay ?
let me leave you with one thought in closing .
whatever it was for you , i bet that , among other things , this gave you a little more freedom , a little more time .
ask ourselves , " is that really going to make me happier ? truly ? "
so when you go home and you walk through your front door , take a second and ask yourselves , " could i do with a little life editing ?
that was one of the funnest moments of my career .
in italy , in milan especially , contemporary art really doesn 't have that much of a place .
there were a lot of programs in architecture and design that were about pointing people in the direction of a better design for a better life .
i came to the united states 13 years ago , and to this day i have to ask , " what does that mean ? "
they are athletic gear for muslim women that enable them to ski , play tennis , do whatever they want to do without having to uncap themselves .
many years ago i heard a mathematician from vienna , whose name was marchetti , explain how the innovation in the military industry -- therefore , secret innovation -- and the innovation in the civilian society are two sinusoids that are kind of opposed .
thank you .
and i will do that by trying to predict precisely at what year the average income per person in india , in china , will reach that of the west .
and they were threatened by those black ships there , that had been in tokyo harbor over the last year .
and japan is trying to move up there .
children started to go to school .
now what does it mean that the -- the averages there -- this is the average of china .
is so rich over there but they are not as healthy as kerala .
look at , look at the united states .
inequalities in china and india i consider really the big obstacle because to bring the entire population into growth and prosperity is what will create a domestic market , what will avoid social instability , and which will make use of the entire capacity of the population .
and if we compare this to more recent representations of the visual system , you 'll see that things have gotten substantially more complicated over the intervening thousand years .
and if you 're thinking of the brain as a computer , this is the transistor .
and antibody stainings like this one can be used to understand that sort of question .
now people i talk to are often surprised when they hear that these are the only four components that make a conservation drone , but they are even more surprised when i tell them how affordable these components are .
but nests are not the only objects these drones can detect .
perhaps the best and most rewarding part about working with these collaborators is the feedback they give us on how to improve our drones .
during its mission , it can even transmit a live video feed back to a ground station laptop , which allows the user to see what the drone is seeing in real time .
you can use , actually , scaffolds , biomaterials -- they 're like the piece of your blouse or your shirt -- but specific materials you can actually implant in patients and they will do well and help you regenerate .
plus we have stem cells .
so that 's actually now in patients .
two weeks later , you have something that looks like a liver .
here 's the scanner going through , scanning the wound .
and dr. kang 's going to walk onstage right now , and we 're actually going to show you one of these kidneys that we printed a little bit earlier today .
so after the surgery , life got a lot better for me .
and when i was 10 , i didn 't realize how amazing it was .
the sun end was about four inches in diameter , and then it tapered over about 35 feet to about a millimeter at the earth end .
i mean , you don 't know necessarily where you 're headed when you begin , even though the forces can be calculated .
i can redeem this painting , just continuing on , doing layers upon layers .
like this green one , this is a painting i did about 10 years ago , but it has some -- see , in the upper third -- there are these moires and interference patterns that are radio kind of imagery .
is that relevant to your work ?
it 's a terrific studio assistant .
which was a very good thing , providing low cost clothing .
and in fact , what we need to do is see that as chapter one , celebrate it , close it , and recognize that we need a chapter two that is all about execution , all about the how-to .
you see people on average making 60 cents to a dollar .
a lot of hurdles .
and so , when i told her about our idea -- that maybe we could take a tupperware model from the united states , and find a way for the women themselves to go out and sell these nets to others -- she quickly started calculating what she herself could make and signed up .
and then i 'll kind of be like -- -- and then they 're like , " whoa ! "
it reminds me of the balancing act earlier on -- what michael was doing -- because you 're fighting so hard to keep the balance with what you 're playing with and stay in tune , and at the same time you don 't want to focus so much on being in tune all the time ; you want to be feeling the music .
leonardo was a man that drew everything around him .
and lastly , the only portrait of a male that leonardo painted , " the musician . "
it 's a statue made by verrocchio , of david , for which leonardo posed as a boy of 15 .
but it turns out , what social scientists are actually learning is that most of us , when put in certain contexts , will actually make very specific mistakes .
and what we see is that people tend to keep making errors exactly the same way , over and over again .
we said , all right , let 's , you know , throw so problems at holly , see if she messes these things up .
when we first gave it to them in their enclosures , they actually kind of picked them up , looked at them .
do the monkeys do anything like this ?
when we introduced sales , we saw the monkeys paid attention to that .
donate it , take it , and so on .
now , you 're going to be deciding how you 're going to lose money , but you 're going to get the same choice .
what you saw in that last scenario is that subjects get risky because they want the small shot that there won 't be any loss .
do the monkeys actually want to play it safe and then go with the guy who 's going to do the same thing on every trial , or do they want to be risky and try to get a risky , but big , bonus , but risk the possibility of getting no bonus .
so what does all of this mean ?
well , one thing we know is that they tend to be really hard to overcome .
but the irony is that it might only be in recognizing our limitations that we can really actually overcome them .
now the problem with this model is that it 's unsustainable globally .
he 's up in legacy good samaritan hospital in portland , oregon .
based on the other images we have , i 'm really happy how it looks today .
you have to earn your way into those places by being sick enough to use that tool for the job .
and this is a picture of my graduation team from legacy .
it 's like a badge of honor to see how long they can get the patient to live .
ed : well , i probably will never get a chance to say this to you in such a large audience ever again .
we call that the concept of passive dynamic locomotion .
so , think of a rimless wheel or a spoke wheel , but the spokes individually move in and out of the hub ; so , it 's a wheel-leg hybrid .
but the current rovers cannot get there .
now , we don 't have enough time to go into technical details , i 'll just show you some of the experiments .
this is a hydras 's arm .
however , still , as you can see , it has a cord , umbilical cord . so , we 're still using an external power source and external computation .
so , this is for the best humanoid , and we would like to bring this for the very first time , to the united states next year , so wish us luck .
first is : where do we get inspiration ?
the rule is : nobody criticizes anybody 's ideas .
so , i always tell my students , " work smart , then work hard . "
we know because it says so inside the code .
sitting down is his brother amjad .
so it used to be fairly easy to know that you 're infected by a virus , when the viruses were written by hobbyists and teenagers .
so you 're sitting on your computer and you 're doing google searches .
and they can afford to watch how we work -- like how security people work -- and try to work their way around any security precautions we can build .
and we can go here and actually start decrypting it .
in fact , this guy drives a mercedes-benz s600 v12 with a six-liter engine with more than 400 horsepower .
and this is what runs our infrastructure .
online crime is the one thing that might take these things away from us .
in the old days of the silent movies -- harold lloyd here , hanging famously from the clock hands -- a lot of these guys did their own stunts . they were quite remarkable .
one of the things that a stuntman often does , and you 'll see it every time in the big movies , is be blown through the air .
and you can 't see it from there , but the engine was in the driver 's lap .
well , you 'd die if you did that .
with the green screen we can put any background in the world on it , moving or still , and i can assure you , nowadays you can 't see the joint .
they first dropped some dummies .
you need a pressure suit .
now just to give you some perspective of this balloon , the little black dots are people .
it was made by a russian that 's designed most of the suits of the past 18 years for the soviets .
thank you very much .
and he didn 't mean the comfort of a five-course dinner as opposed to a one-course meal , but he really meant the comfort of the quality of the building for the people .
they are in green energy consulting , or something like that .
it could also be something like this : the national museum of science in london , where this blue is embracing all the exhibitions and galleries in one large gesture .
it is the place where we gather around when we have to say something to each other .
and of course , we had the metal halide lamps and fluorescent lamps and things like that .
we can go further .
i think , when i see it , i start to think , who are those people ?
i 'm going to try to give you a little bit of a natural history of compassion and the golden rule .
actually , i think the bad news about kin selection is just that it means that this kind of compassion is naturally deployed only within the family .
so , they do understand that if you want to be treated well , you treat other people well .
now , there 's one piece of good news i have that may save the world . okay .
in a war , two allies are playing a non-zero-sum game .
i mean , if you look at the american attitudes toward japanese during world war ii -- look at the depictions of japanese in the american media as just about subhuman , and look at the fact that we dropped atomic bombs , really without giving it much of a thought -- and you compare that to the attitude now , i think part of that is due to a kind of economic interdependence .
if there 's one thing i can encourage everyone to do , politicians , religious leaders , and us , it would be what i call " expanding the moral imagination " -- that is to say , your ability to put yourself in the shoes of people in very different circumstances .
and it 's going to take real work to change that .
i made hundreds of them for the last 75 years .
i was incredibly curious to see the world , and i made all these things , which then finally did take me to see many countries and many cultures .
so he asked me , could he please visit me , and then finally he did , and explained to me that what i did now in my shop was an anachronism , that the industrial revolution had broken out , and that i rather should join the factory .
moderator : yes , i am sure .
they have very few genes , and genetic information to encode all of the traits that they carry out .
i mean they 're incredibly small , you have to have a microscope to see one .
the reason that vibrio fischeri is doing that comes from the biology .
these are just like the receptors on the surfaces of your cells .
what that does is to confer exquisite species specificities to these languages .
it 's a very small , five-carbon molecule .
by targeting the red system , what we are able to do is to make species-specific , or disease-specific , anti-quorum sensing molecules .
we know that the principles and the rules , if we can figure them out in these sort of primitive organisms , the hope is that they will be applied to other human diseases and human behaviors as well .
it 's a big treat for me to get to come to this conference .
ok , does anybody realize there 's a crisis in our schools , around the world ?
so , that 's sort of to put it in perspective here .
we 've been working with amd , which has a project called 50 by ' 15 , which is trying to bring internet connectivity to 50 percent of the world 's population by 2015 .
we 're talking about books on hyper geometric partial differential equations .
and the thing that i realized is there was no way that i , as an engineer , could write this book that would get all of this across .
how many people have heard of creative commons ?
this is a little bit of a problem , so we clearly need some kind of idea of quality control , and this is really where the idea of review and peer review comes in .
and i found that there was an historic precedence .
most of all , i was just surprised with what i was finding .
and they were unexpected and they were surprising .
in the middle , we sort of made our way into a song called " titi boom . "
we 'll see what happens when we play with this palette .
and the other dynamic of it is that we don 't micromanage in jazz .
i 'm focused on two projects i want to tell you about .
it has a little cough and a hiccup , and out comes sprays of little frogs .
we took the eggs of a related species , a living frog , and we inactivated the nucleus of the egg .
we haven 't done it yet , but keep those applause ready .
climate change has affected the world for a long period of time , and gradually , the forests disappeared , the country began to dry out , and the number of kinds of thylacines began to decline , until by five million years ago , only one left .
i was fascinated by thylacines . i 've always been obsessed with these animals .
well , george church in his book , " regenesis , " has mentioned many of the techniques that are rapidly advancing to work with fragmented dna .
are we going to get a frankenstein ?
there were the wooden boards on the sides of the hut where he and his father and his brother had slept at night .
if it had not been illegal to keep these thylacines as pets then , would the thylacine be extinct now ?
this quandary led to the title of the project , which considers in many ways that we are all the living dead and that we in some ways represent ghosts of the past and the future .
he was sent in 1907 to palestine by the zionist organization to look at areas for jewish settlement and acquire land for jewish settlement .
they include dengue fever , imprisonment , army service , women not allowed to be photographed for religious and cultural reasons .
during the time i was in bosnia , the mortal remains of zumra 's eldest son were exhumed from a mass grave .
there 's also parents who participated who wouldn 't let their children participate because they thought they were too young to decide for themselves .
so after i returned home , i received word that one member of the family had been shot 30 times in the face .
something is said in the gaps between all the information that 's collected .
so books really are alive .
it allowed painting to not have to have that everyday chore of telling the story , and painting became free and was allowed to tell its own story , and that 's when we saw modernism emerge , and we saw painting go into different branches .
before going further , let me give you a crash course in plant biology .
as i explained earlier , plants extract phosphorus from the soil , through water .
eighty percent of each dose of phosphorus is lost .
as you can see , they meet in 2030 , i 'll be retired by then .
beyond one millimeter , the root is ineffective .
even though it is present in the soil , it is in insoluble form .
we have a technology that works , and one that , if used correctly , will alleviate some of the pressure we are putting on the world 's phosphorus reserves .
they had one camel left over .
it 's us who act as the surrounding community around any conflict , who can play a constructive role .
and as the saying goes , when angry , you will make the best speech you will ever regret .
now i don 't pretend to have an answer to the middle east conflict , but i think i 've got a first step , literally , a first step , something that any one of us could do as third-siders .
now as anthropologists , we know that every culture has an origin story .
now it 's not enough just to tell a story -- that 's powerful -- but people need to experience the story .
we did our due diligence .
for those who can 't walk , who are unable to get there right now , people started to organize walks in cities , in their own communities .
and so more and more walkers have come , and lately she 's begun to earn an income to support her family .
it was done in northern ireland .
i mean , somebody pays you to go around and travel and look at some of the most beautiful places on the planet .
the coral reefs of the north coast of jamaica have a few percent live coral cover and a lot of seaweed and slime .
and the average size trophy fish weighed 250 to 300 pounds , goliath grouper , and if you wanted to go out and kill something , you could pretty much count on being able to catch one of those fish .
a book was written about it .
in the upper right of that picture on the left is almost the mississippi delta , and the lower left of that picture is the texas-mexico border .
the military of the arctic nations is taking it really seriously .
but what does that mean ?
i 'm a believer .
that has got to be stopped .
they 're there to control , keep the shipping lanes open and make oil available .
that 's not sustainable either .
it 's going to be simple to accomplish this .
there are 250 million vehicles in america .
tbp : i lost 150 million dollars .
somebody the other day said i was the second largest natural gas producer in the united states .
i think you 're a person who believes in your legacy .
you 're going to have to have energy . there is no question .
there 's no problems .
what is at the other end of that bridge is for this audience to figure out .
what gender do you like to sleep with ?
so i went home , and i shaved my head , and i came back the next day and i said , " i 'm a boy . "
when a kid behaves like i did , they don 't exactly have to come out , right ?
but i was plagued by this question : how could anyone vote to strip the rights of the vast variety of people that i knew based on one element of their character ?
my aim is to take a simple portrait of anyone who 's anything other than 100 percent straight or feels like they fall in the lgbtq spectrum in any way .
that video was made in the spring of 2011 , and as of today i have traveled to almost 20 cities and photographed almost 2,000 people .
of course , there were lots of people who opted for a 100 percent one or the other , but i found that a much larger proportion of people identified as something that was much more nuanced .
at the very least i hope it makes it harder to deny their human rights .
so in a nutshell , that 's the challenge that we all face today at this interesting point in history .
well , the first and most obvious reason is because that 's what we ask them to do .
and so you may say , well , given all of that , why then doesn 't it work ?
if a country has a great , positive image , like germany has or sweden or switzerland , everything is easy and everything is cheap .
this one is called the good country index , and it does exactly what it says on the tin .
now the other thing you 'll notice about the top 10 there is , of course , they 're all , apart from new zealand , western european nations .
i 've had enough hearing about competitive countries .
that word , " good , " and the number 6.8 and the discovery that 's behind it have changed my life .
it 's kind of like a new approach to desktop computing .
so one thing we have for that is like a grid align , kind of -- so you get that more traditional desktop . things are kind of grid aligned .
i know what is wrong . i have done wrong .
what tony sees in that moment is the project of philosophy , the project that begins in wonder -- what kant called " admiration and awe at the starry sky above and the moral law within . "
first , of course , the economic meltdown .
we believe in risk awareness .
will government change ?
so i 've had incredibly many women role models that have influenced who i am and where i am today .
i 'm not using this phrase metaphorically , the ceiling actually collapsed one day in our living room .
so you can see my confusion here .
the human does a thing , the robot analyzes whatever the human did , then the robot decides what to do next , plans it and does it .
but our bodies feed back into our brain to generate the way that we behave .
let 's call it the adventurous brain .
the human would play , the robot would analyze what was played , would improvise their own part .
and i went back to my animation tools and tried to figure out not just what a robotic musician would look like , but especially what a robotic musician would move like .
just to introduce the last robot that we 've worked on , that came out of something kind of surprising that we found : at some point people didn 't care anymore about the robot being so intelligent , and can improvise and listen , and do all these embodied intelligence things that i spent years on developing .
and maybe as humans , robots that are a little less than perfect are just perfect for us .
and so i was thinking about how it might be great if i could just take all these noises -- like all these sounds of my thoughts in my head -- if i could just physically extricate them and pull them out in such a form that i could share them with somebody else .
so the discommunicator is a tool for arguments .
they actually have these buses that drive up and over the lateral moraine and drop people off on the surface of the glacier .
i want to start off by saying , houston , we have a problem .
there were probably at least 30,000 different things tried , and when they crash and kill the pilot , don 't try that again .
and there 's a lot of them that i actually can 't show you on this chart .
in 2004 , there were only two flights : two russian soyuz flights to the international manned station . and i had to fly three in mojave with my little group of a couple dozen people in order to get to a total of five , which was the number the same year back in 1961 .
and i used to be bothered by that , and then i got to thinking , well , wait a minute . i bought my first apple computer in 1978 and i bought it because i could say , " i got a computer at my house and you don 't .
what 's out there is there 's something really interesting going to happen here .
i think what we 'll do is we 'll see a successful , very successful , private space flight industry . whether we 're first or not really doesn 't matter .
by invisible , i mean it doesn 't absorb in the electromagnetic spectrum .
so we see the galaxy and fixate on that , but it 's actually a cloud of dark matter that 's dominating the structure and the dynamics of this galaxy .
how do we see that galaxy ?
a circle , a ring . it 's called an einstein ring . einstein predicted that , ok .
do we see arcs in the sky when we look at , say , a cluster of galaxies ?
if you could do this , what you would find that with each passing day , each passing year , each passing billions of years , ok , the distance between galaxies is getting greater .
we call it dark energy , and it has this effect of causing space to expand .
so one way to look for them is to build detectors that are extremely sensitive to a dark matter particle coming through and bumping it .
so we got a little snippet of a thought , and we could see it in front of us .
and aurora liked to play video games .
by all purposes and means , aurora 's brain has incorporated that artificial device as an extension of her body .
and the brain is deciding what is the texture associated with the reward .
this is one of the experiments in which that robot was able to walk autonomously .
and what you see here is , you see a little bit of crude oil , you see some ice cubes , and you see two sandwich baggies of napalm .
oil doesn 't sink , it floats .
and this is what happens to us at the gas pump -- and actually , gas pumps are specifically designed to diffuse that anger .
and so , cognitive dissonance is part and parcel of the way that we deal with oil , and it 's really important to dealing with this oil spill .
and then there 's this guy , okay .
and we have this kind of -- as voters , we have kind of a " eureka ! " moment .
the other thing that we 've done , as we 've continued to increase demand , is that we kind of play a shell game with the costs .
and finally , american families also pay a price for oil .
we actually encourage people to drive more .
and also , the hope is that you start to be connected to the whole greater system .
they brought all sorts of different computers with them .
and that is what has made it most fun .
so , he 'd taken this data and made a presentation which just shattered a lot of myths that people had about the economics in the developing world .
and when it has relationships , whenever it expresses a relationship then the other thing that it 's related to is given one of those names that starts http .
let 's think about data for a bit .
ok , we have to ask for raw data now .
well , you take that mouthful and you put it into google .
zoom in and that square thing is a theater -- which we 're in right now -- the terrace theater . it didn 't have a name on it .
i want you to make it .
fast forward four years later , after having written a 40-page business plan on the cell phone , having written my patent on the cell phone , i 'm the youngest patent-holder in the country , and — — i can 't say any more than that .
i 'm also currently the best student entrepreneur in the world , the first african to get that accolade , and one thing that really puzzles me is , i did all of this just because i didn 't want to bathe . thank you .
and how does it work ?
you haven 't brought it about in any way .
but once in a while , something very difficult is given to us , and when this difficult thing occurs to us , it 's a challenge to rise to that opportunity , and we can rise to it by learning something which is sometimes painful .
we miss the opportunity because we don 't stop .
mostly it 's the opportunity to enjoy , but sometimes it 's something more difficult .
and that is what i hope for us , and if this has contributed a little to making you want to do the same , stop , look , go .
it reduces everything down to what 's relevant and it discards everything that 's not relevant .
it 's a dislocation between what you see and what you hear .
if you can 't hear somebody talking to you in a loud voice , it 's too loud .
and music , of course . just listening to music is good for you , if it 's music that 's made with good intention , made with love , generally .
i wish you sound health .
you 'll find it inside of you .
it actually takes things we would consider waste -- things like seed husks or woody biomass -- and can transform them into a chitinous polymer , which you can form into almost any shape .
and it 's when this lid goes on the part , that the magic really starts .
the first reason is local open feedstocks .
and for the last four years , my coauthor phanish puranam and i spent investigating this topic .
it could also be novel ways of organizing firms and industries .
but of course , when you climb onto the boeing 787 , you are not going to know that this is invisible innovation out of india .
what we are trying to say is that once you outsource the bottom end of the ladder , you -- it 's a self-perpetuating act , because of the sinking skill ladder , and the sinking skill ladder is simply the point that you can 't be an investment banker without having been an analyst once .
so you tell me , is ibm an american company , or an indian company ?
it is using that money more rationally to make the countries of the world secure , to make the people of the world secure .
he said , " you know that i kind of like meditation , and i pray . "
she has been in exile for the last year and a half .
i 'll tell you the quick story .
it 's hard work every single day .
so that question is really powerful , and it was certainly powerful to us in the moment , when you connect it to the stories that some detroiters had , and actually a lot of african-americans ' families have had that are living in midwestern cities like detroit .
so it 's a lot of vacancy .
then we also wanted to look at other ways of using land in addition to growing food and transforming landscape into much more productive uses , so that it could be used for storm water management , for example , by using surface lakes and retention ponds , that created neighborhood amenities , places of recreation , and actually helped to elevate adjacent property levels .
and i first begin with a pie chart -- and i promise this is the only pie chart in the whole presentation -- but it sets up the state of our knowledge of the cosmos .
you need something like tens of megatons of water -- almost a gigaton of water -- in order to have any chance of catching this neutrino .
and just to give you an idea , they have spent 20 million over 20 years .
finally , i want to take you to antarctica .
so you 're using a balloon to carry something that is two tons all the way to an altitude of 40 km .
they 're wearing about 15 kg of clothing and stuff , but they have to take their gloves off in order to do that .
you can see my fellow riders at the end of the picture , looking at me with some concern .
but that 's one reason why they ended up where they were .
but that 's what he had all his life , people walking away from him .
i had an image of lance armstrong in my mind .
now , let me give you an example of how it works .
and so , perspective and context and history play key roles in the way i plan my rides with the kids .
and we 're just beginning to understand this stuff .
so , all you guys have heard about dna , all the stuff that dna does , but some of the stuff we 're discovering is kind of nifty because this turns out to be the single most abundant species on the planet .
so , it 's about the size of a little period on a sentence .
and when we learn how to close the gene gaps , then we can put a full string of dna together .
because this thing codes ones and zeros , and this thing codes a , t , c , gs , and it sits up there , absorbing energy on a tree , and one fine day it has enough energy to say , execute , and it goes [ thump ] . right ?
that 's perfectly clear . so , men read that sentence , and they look at that sentence , and they read this .
because in all leukemia , that set of genes over there over-expresses .
well , it turns out that there 's about 27 trillion bits moving inside from the united states to the united states ; about 4.6 trillion is going over to those european countries ; about 5.5 's going to japan ; there 's almost no communication between japan , and nobody else is literate in this stuff .
so , if there is something you should fear , it 's that you 're not keeping your eye on the ball .
silicon valley did . and that 's why they say that silicon valley has been powered by ics .
alcohol was the daytime beverage of choice .
we have the kind of the flash of insight , the stroke of insight , we have epiphanies , we have " eureka ! " moments , we have the lightbulb moments , right ?
so they started to think , " could we build a neonatal incubator that 's built entirely out of automobile parts ? "
this is what your office should look like , is part of my message here .
he 's in his study , it 's october of 1838 , and he 's reading malthus , actually , on population .
it 's october of 1957 , and sputnik has just launched , and we 're in laurel maryland , at the applied physics lab associated with johns hopkins university .
and so they bring in this big , clunky analog tape recorder and they start recording these little bleep , bleeps .
so we 're thinking , we could throw up a bunch of satellites and use it to track our submarines and figure out their location in the middle of the ocean .
and i 'm here to unveil our latest effort , and most successful effort so far , which is still very much a work in process .
and , as he picks up a product the system can recognize the product that he 's picking up , using either image recognition or marker technology , and give him the green light or an orange light .
and who knows , maybe in another 10 years we 'll be here with the ultimate sixth sense brain implant .
these 1.4 million cellular radio masts , or base stations , consume a lot of energy .
and in the middle there , we have this visible light spectrum .
an led is a semiconductor . it 's an electronic device .
and the light goes through that hole .
you don 't notice with your human eye .
you have lights in an aircraft .
intrinsically safe environments like this petrochemical plant -- you can 't use rf , it may generate antenna sparks , but you can use light -- you see plenty of light there .
they 're fighting to develop their own way of living within the forest in a world that 's clean , a world that isn 't contaminated , a world that isn 't polluted .
for example , for the first time , a few years ago , by simply collecting little fecal samples we were able to have them analyzed -- to have dna profiling done -- so for the first time , we actually know which male chimps are the fathers of each individual infant .
it was , fortunately , one adult male whom i 'd named david greybeard -- and by the way , science at that time was telling me that i shouldn 't name the chimps ; they should all have numbers ; that was more scientific .
they have very sophisticated cooperation .
they 're given weapons ; they shoot for the logging camps ; they get money .
do you know we all have about 50 chemicals in our bodies we didn 't have about 50 years ago ?
see the brick walls as all the problems that we 've inflicted on this planet .
that 's effective , but if they decide themselves , " we want to clean this river and put the fish back that used to be there .
how many more minutes ? two , one ?
nelson mandela -- i take a little piece of limestone from robben island prison , where he labored for 27 years , and came out with so little bitterness , he could lead his people from the horror of apartheid without a bloodbath .
so actually how do we harvest this bone marrow ?
so i did a few prototypes . i got a small little grant at stanford .
hopefully this technology will let us have more of these survivors in the future .
well , i think it 's a combination of two features of our intellectual culture that like to think they 're opposing each other but in fact they share a common set of assumptions .
two : well , maybe it exists , but it 's really something else .
now , that 's the common-sense definition . that 's our target .
i mean , if a bunch of experts come to me and say , " we are heavy-duty neurobiologists and we 've done a study of you , searle , and we 're convinced you are not conscious , you are a very cleverly constructed robot , " i don 't think , " well , maybe these guys are right , you know ? "
sorry to use philosophical terminology here , but when it 's secreted at the axon end-plates of the motor neurons , a whole lot of wonderful things happen in the ion channels and the damned arm goes up .
it creates a reality of money , property , government , marriage , cern conferences , cocktail parties and summer vacations , and all of those are creations of consciousness .
you can make objective claims about a domain that is subjective in its mode of existence , and indeed that 's what neurologists do .
all we need is a playing card . any card will do .
make a wish .
the odds of getting it are 4,165 to one .
i promise she read that text .
we do social change .
maybe there 's some studies , some longitudinal studies , that cost lots of money and took lots of time .
and he actually took one look at my squiggly line , and said , " well , why don 't you just embrace the shake ? "
but as i searched around in the darkness , i realized i was actually paralyzed by all of the choices that i never had before .
in the beginning of goodbye art , i focused on forced destruction , like this image of jimi hendrix , made with over 7,000 matches .
learning to be creative within the confines of our limitations is the best hope we have to transform ourselves and , collectively , transform our world .
and the slide behind me barely scratches the surface of how widespread they are in animals .
a reproductive system that fails to function produces an individual that has no offspring , and that individual is then kicked out of the gene pool .
because after about six months of me talking about this , i think he finally figured out that i was really serious about the penis thing .
and i thought , " yeah , he does have a really good point here . "
they 're an integral part of the penile skeleton .
for years i 've been telling people , stress makes you sick .
now to explain how this works , i want you all to pretend that you are participants in a study designed to stress you out .
your heart might be pounding , you might be breathing faster , maybe breaking out into a sweat .
and we just did a little intervention .
your biological stress response is nudging you to tell someone how you feel instead of bottling it up .
caring created resilience .
which is ever since , in the u.k. , they banned smoking in public places , i 've never enjoyed a drinks party ever again .
there 's an experiment i think daniel pink refers to where you put two dogs in a box and the box has an electric floor .
what you call them actually affects how you react to them , viscerally and morally .
if you 're a creative person , i think quite rightly , you have to share all your ideas for approval with people much more rational than you .
i 'm not asking for the complete primacy of one over the other .
the likelihood that people will get to the end is much greater when there is a milestone somewhere in the middle .
here 's a guy you all need to study .
he says , if you run a restaurant , there is no healthy distinction to be made between the value you create by cooking the food and the value you create by sweeping the floor .
the only thing they don 't expect is they 're uniting europe through a shared mild hatred of the french and germans .
our neighborhood was full of large families , where fathers were the heads of households , so i grew up seeing my mother as a divorcee in a patriarchal environment .
now one other thing women like my grandma do in turkey is to cover mirrors with velvet or to hang them on the walls with their backs facing out .
so from this small , superstitious , middle-class neighborhood of my grandmother , i was zoomed into this posh , international school [ in madrid ] , where i was the only turk .
i watched the man open a pack of cigarettes with trembling hands and offer one to her , and that is the image of the night of the earthquake in my mind today -- a conservative grocer and a crying transvestite smoking together on the sidewalk .
i guess one part of me has always been a nomad , physically and spiritually .
when the interviewer tried to pigeonhole him as a gay writer , baldwin stopped and said , " but don 't you see ? there 's nothing in me that is not in everybody else , and nothing in everybody else that is not in me . "
writers are entitled to their political opinions , and there are good political novels out there , but the language of fiction is not the language of daily politics .
but i 'm also aware of the danger of fetishizing them .
i might write about a muslim woman in one novel , and perhaps it will be a very happy story , and in my next book , i might write about a handsome , gay professor in norway .
now , sometimes you might last longer than 20 minutes , or even shorter , but i think we all suffer from it . and do you have the accompanying guilt ?
we tell stories all the time about everything , and i think we do it because the world is kind of a crazy , chaotic place , and sometimes stories , we 're trying to make sense of the world a little bit , trying to bring some order to it .
i can do whatever i want , i can come up with whatever story i want to .
not the wife , not the kids . okay , the maid can come in and clean . "
the next painting i 'm going to talk about is called " boy building a house of cards " by chardin .
the last painting i 'm going to talk about is called " anonymous " by anonymous .
who is going to inherit his name and his fortune ?
afterwards , i found george on the terrace overlooking the kitchen garden .
and whether it 's the opening line from " one hundred years of solitude " or the fantastical stream of consciousness in " autumn of the patriarch , " where the words rush by , page after page of unpunctuated imagery sweeping the reader along like some wild river twisting through a primal south american jungle , reading márquez is a visceral experience .
and that 's when i discovered comedy .
now it 's not often that i 'm going to associate the words honesty and integrity with limbaugh , but it 's really hard to argue with that punchline .
three things i 've tried to avoid my entire life .
clearly , it didn 't come out of a tonight show monologue .
and this cartoon hit the bull 's eye .
not that you do ; i 'm just saying .
so i want to ask a question : what should culture in the 21st century look like ?
they make a lot of money .
for me it was a new discovery .
thank you . thank you !
these kids on the internet , they have this group of kids and they like to say funny words like " barrel roll . "
and rick astley 's kind of rebirth these past two years ...
and so they placed me on it , and the internet got wind of it . my community decided they wanted me to win it .
so what they did is they -- i mean , they put csi to shame here -- the internet detectives came out .
you 've had to wrestle with issues like child pornography .
love and peace were mentioned , kind of with quote marks around them , right ?
cp : at first , very kind of pained , awkward conversations .
except in a few special circumstances : in women , blood vessels grow every month to build the lining of the uterus ; during pregnancy , they form the placenta , which connects mom and baby .
they start out as small , microscopic nests of cells that can only grow to one half a cubic millimeter in size ; that 's the tip of a ballpoint pen .
and you can see that the halo of blood flow disappears after treatment .
now , obviously , antiangiogenic therapy could be used for a wide range of cancers .
our search for this has taken us to the market , the farm and to the spice cabinet , because what we 've discovered is that mother nature has laced a large number of foods and beverages and herbs with naturally occurring inhibitors of angiogenesis .
so the shorter the bar , less angiogenesis , that 's good .
because it turns out that adipose tissue , fat , is highly angiogenesis dependent .
do you recommend pursuing these treatments now , for most cancer patients ?
the oil was running out , and a nuclear winter would finish us off .
it just tells you they were both designed to fit the human hand .
it 's not confined to its own lineage .
so oz is better at both spears and axes than adam .
in other words , the average person on the average wage could not afford a candle in 1800 .
and that 's what we 've done , because we 're all working for each other .
the woman knows that , in the hadzas ' case here -- digging roots to share with men in exchange for meat -- she knows that all she has to do to get access to protein is to dig some extra roots and trade them for meat .
and when human beings began moving objects around like this , it was evidence that they were exchanging between groups .
the reason : because tierra del fuego is separated from south america by a much narrower straight , and there was trading contact across that straight throughout 10,000 years .
what 's relevant to a society is how well people are communicating their ideas , and how well they 're cooperating , not how clever the individuals are .
this is the planet jupiter .
we didn 't have the technology to transmit .
fifty years on from watson 's accidental encounter with the sun , jansky 's careful listening ushered in a new age of space exploration : the radio astronomy age .
now , extinction is a different kind of death .
it was loved . they tried to protect it . it died anyway .
so he and ryan organized and hosted a meeting at the wyss institute in harvard bringing together specialists on passenger pigeons , conservation ornithologists , bioethicists , and fortunately passenger pigeon dna had already been sequenced by a molecular biologist named beth shapiro .
now , there 's work to do .
now , re-wilding is moving faster in korea than it is in america , and so the plan is , with these re-wilded areas all over europe , they will introduce the aurochs to do its old job , its old ecological role , of clearing the somewhat barren , closed-canopy forest so that it has these biodiverse meadows in it .
ben novak was the youngest scientist at the meeting .
that technology will be used on de-extincted animals .
what are they concerned about ?
i think that 's , you know , part of how it 'll work .
if you 're using the exact same amount of surface of oil absorbent , but you 're just paying attention to natural patterns , and if you 're going up the winds , you can collect a lot more material .
we 're catching wind from both sides .
other property is this : a normal sailing boat has a centerboard here and a rudder at the back , and these two things are what creates most resistance and turbulence behind the boat , but because this doesn 't have either a centerboard or a rudder , we hope that if we keep working on this hull design we can improve and have less resistance .
this idea really appealed to gabriella levine in new york , and so she decided to prototype this idea that she saw , and she documented every step of the process , and she published it on instructables , which is a website for sharing inventions .
and we replace the human being -- to go , for example , for measuring radioactivity , you don 't want a human to be sailing those robots -- with batteries , motors , micro-controllers and sensors .
there is no longer any consistency in the surface signals .
with neutral , there 's nothing in particular that evan needs to do .
but with " disappear , " there 's really no analogies -- so evan , what you want to do here is to imagine the cube slowly fading out , okay .
you know , from the user interface of the control system to opening curtains or closing curtains .
from my seat , i was looking up at a stone town on a hilltop , bright in the noontime sun , when from behind there was a great bang , as loud and violent as a bomb .
abed said that i should call back in a few weeks , and when i did , and a recording told me that his number was disconnected , i let abed and the crash go .
were we instead our bodies , their inborn endowments and deficits ?
i was me , but i was now me despite a limp , and that , i suppose , was what now made me , me .
twenty-one years later , he was now thinner than his wife , his skin slack on his face , and looking at abed looking at his young self , i remembered looking at that photograph of my young self after the crash , and recognized his longing .
some , as had i , would remember .
but it was hard for me to relate to one who had so completely washed his hands of his own calamitous doing , to one whose life was so unexamined that he said he thought two people had died in the crash .
i told him the name of that man .
so that 's how it all started .
and i said , " well i 've been a woman for 60 years , but i 've only been secretary of state for a few minutes . "
so i think that it behooves us -- those of us that live in various countries where we do have economic and political voice -- that we need to help other women .
and we lobbied on behalf of women 's issues .
and all of a sudden we were talking about arms control , and she said , " well i feel we should do this . "
early visions of wireless power actually were thought of by nikola tesla basically about 100 years ago .
do you ever wonder what happens to this stuff ?
what dr. soljacic figured out how to do was separate the coils in a transformer to a greater distance than the size of those transformers using this technology , which is not dissimilar from the way an opera singer shatters a glass on the other side of the room .
mobile electronics .
and if the demo gods are willing , in about 10 seconds or so we should see it .
you know , it 's the latest thing that 's come out .
and for those of you who can 't read it , it says , " it does appear to be some kind of wireless technology . "
but you have it in planets and asteroids .
and if you place a cool gas in front of a hot source , you will see certain patterns which we call absorption lines .
it 's a heavy element produced in thermonuclear explosions of supernovae .
and we found that everything is normal .
it is an amazing tool called astroseismology where we can detect sound waves in the atmospheres of stars .
it 's really difficult .
there can be different ways doing this .
my story actually began when i was four years old and my family moved to a new neighborhood in our hometown of savannah , georgia .
and my doctor , on a whim , sent me to get a full-body bone scan , which showed that there was some growth in my left leg .
i would reach out to six men from all parts of my life and ask them to be present in the passages of my daughters ' lives .
so i wasn 't going to tell her about this idea , but the next day i couldn 't control myself , i told her .
i was like , " cow tipping ?
and as he talked he had that glint in his eye that i first saw back in holland -- the glint that says , " let 's go cow tipping , " even though we never did tip the cow , even though no one tips the cow , even though cows don 't sleep standing up .
and i remember a particular one night that , when you told that story of -- i don 't know where you are dr. nuland -- of william sloane coffin -- it made me think of it .
cancer , i found , is a passport to intimacy .
but like a lot of modern men , he hugs , he bakes , he leaves work early to coach little league .
as my physical therapist likes to say , " every step is a tragedy waiting to happen . "
come the one year anniversary of my journey , i went to see my surgeon , dr. john healey -- and by the way , healey , great name for a doctor .
but i 'll just close what i 've been talking about by leaving you with this message : may you find an excuse to reach out to some long-lost pal , or to that college roommate , or to some person you may have turned away from .
you know , they were marginalized in the negotiation room .
here in galapagos , we 're affected by el ninos and la nina .
it 's a scientific drilling vessel .
this is the part of antarctica that we worry about .
and we saw about 35 alternations between open water and ice-covered water , between gravels and these plant sediments .
it 's about a meter tall pavona clavus colony .
so we have a diamond drill .
then their other attribute is that they have this great chemistry .
this is as messy as it gets .
that is what 's happening right now , and it 's a very different issue than the global warming issue .
that 's the reason that they 're not able to respond or adapt to this rapid acidification that 's going on right now .
and to write a new operating system was not a capricious matter .
one thing you might get is something like the luminous room .
and finally , to pull out all the stops , this is a system called urp , for urban planners , in which we give architects and urban planners back the models that we confiscated when we insisted that they use cad systems .
and the result is sort of gratifyingly perpetual .
and then if it 's time for analysis , we can pull back a little bit and ask for a different distribution .
well , that doesn 't really cut it anymore .
so we have a large number of movies stuck inside here .
can it be for every man , or is this just for corporations and movie producers ?
and i understand what you 're asking .
and then there was a silence -- one of those awful silences when you know something 's wrong .
no special needs schools .
and then i managed a restaurant , and then i slipped on things .
and it 's frightening , isn 't it ?
why are you fighting so hard not to be yourself ?
really not a very sensible thing to do .
i was crumpled .
i know how to be mowgli .
i left , and i became a social entrepreneur , and i set up an organization with mark shand called elephant family , which deals with asian elephant conservation .
i simply needed vision and belief .
and they got fabulously wealthy in doing so .
and the chinese respond in a very ugly way .
that 's what you want .
and back home , what do you see ?
there are a lot of countries , oil-producing countries , that aren 't very democratic , but supported by the united states .
well , obviously , when people die in the war , they are muslims , they are iraqis -- they 're not americans .
you know what it means .
you 've got to see this -- bible boot camp .
that 's what they are to you .
she 's my sister , my wife , my cousin , my neighbor .
and maybe they succeeded . maybe they succeeded .
now , you might ask , " okay , sam , so why do you do this sort of thing ?
and now perhaps -- perhaps -- you do too .
so when netra and i sat down to make our first plan 10 years ago , we said we want the focus of this plan to go way beyond ourselves .
anyway , you know , i really make decisions all the time about how i want to remember myself , and that 's the most important kind of decisions i make .
i can actually visualize my future approaching .
history as an imaging tool ?
good morning .
now , each year we perform about 300,000 surgeries .
if you think about it , i think the eyeball is the same , as american or african , the problem is the same , the treatment is the same .
so i think we have a process by which we can really penetrate into the market and reach everyone who needs it , and in this process of using technology , make sure that most don 't need to come to the base hospital .
i think that has been a big savior , even now .
we looked at cost .
i do a radio show .
this is a wonderful thing .
unlike the occupants of the universe , the universe itself is not wasteful .
you may well have your own children and think , " oh no , my child 's best . "
if you actually think , you remove the myth and there is still something wonderful .
i have chosen to make silly jokes about quantum mechanics and the copenhagen interpretation .
and that 's not a good experience when you 're used to experiences like this .
each one of them found this .
so let 's look at the concept of traditional anthropology .
so , in the same way that you wake up , take a shower and get dressed , you have to learn to do that for your digital self .
it gets adopted because people use it and it 's made for humans .
one i 'm really worried about is that people aren 't taking time for mental reflection anymore , and that they aren 't slowing down and stopping , being around all those people in the room all the time that are trying to compete for their attention on the simultaneous time interfaces , paleontology and panic architecture .
and i started grappling with this existential angst of what little i had done with my life .
as a matter of fact , this picture is supposed to be me during training .
and there are all kinds of problems .
is this an envelope we 're living inside of , or no , does it go onto infinity in both time and space ?
the most venomous animal that lives in the ocean is the box jellyfish .
i didn 't get out , but was in the water taking prednisone shots , taking xanax , oxygen to the face .
we 've got benadryl on board . if i get stung , i 'll just grin and bear it .
i finished the swim like this .
thank you .
and if you read the press , it actually last week said i quit the media lab .
steve jobs had given us some laptops ; we were in senegal .
it 's a nonprofit association ; it raised about 20 million dollars to do the engineering to just get this built , and then have it produced afterwards .
well , no , it 's not a laptop project . it 's an education project .
and we 've been going steadily downhill .
now , i 'm going to pass this around .
it 's kind of agonizing , because a lot of people say , " well , let 's do it at the state level , " because , of course , states are more nimble than the feds , just because of size .
it looks like a post office truck .
well , on december 12 , a company called quanta agreed to build it , and since they make about one-third of all the laptops on the planet today , that question disappeared .
we 're told what shape we 're supposed to be in .
my parents got divorced , and my sister was arrested .
and i think , i truly believe , that we can change this thing one laugh at a time .
and when we heard a lot of the presentations over the last couple of days , ed wilson and the pictures of james nachtwey , i think we all realized how far we have to go to get to this new version of humanity that i like to call " humanity 2.0 . "
i started a couple of businesses that i thought would be the ticket to financial freedom .
these leading , innovative , nonprofit folks , who are using business skills in a very leveraged way to solve social problems .
so , in 2003 , i started to make my way around los angeles to talk about the idea of a pro-social media company and i was met with a lot of encouragement .
and then the movie about this person doing these things , then led to this greater renewal .
and it 's the true story of congressman charlie wilson , and how he funded the taliban to fight the russians in afghanistan .
and i guess many of you here think that this is quite fantastic -- except for me . i don 't agree with this .
i actually like that one .
i would cut my costs by 90 percent .
actually it sounded nice in the beginning , but when you look at 600 summaries , it 's quite a lot .
so here it is , a crowd-sourced , six-word summary of a thousand tedtalks at the value of $ 99.50 : " why the worry ? i 'd rather wonder . "
the great majority of organisms on earth remain unknown to science .
at this point i think we have a little impressionistic film that was made especially for this occasion .
each has persisted for thousands to millions of years .
only about 15 percent of the known species have been studied well enough to evaluate their status .
technology has moved forward .
just absolutely amazing , every single dive .
here we 're going to see one backing into a crevice , and watch his tentacles -- he just pulls them in , makes them look just like algae .
just an amazing animal , it can change color and texture to match the surroundings . watch him blend right into this algae .
and now it goes from -- yes , now it goes from left to right .
can i have the feeler here ?
the wind may turn , but the animal will turn always its nose into the wind .
but after having lost a beloved teacher in 2006 and a good friend last year to suicide , and sitting last year at tedactive , i knew that i needed to step out of my silence and past my taboos to talk about an idea worth spreading -- and that is that people who have made the difficult choice to come back to life need more resources and need our help .
the answer turns out to be two percent .
first of all , there is a suggestion of some error .
he really has no idea as to what 's actually going on in the world .
i 'm obviously not going to be able to do that for you today , so let me just present to you two headlines as an illustration of what i have in mind .
but i will first teach you a method , how you can do it without moving the wrist , and then the shortcut .
i talked to a nice girl before , zoe .
and here , i had a mat here to make it a little -- the critical moment is -- sorry .
now , if you are interested , i will demonstrate some underground techniques .
shuffle tracking means i keep track of the cards , even if another person shuffles .
right ?
the new chaos theory is already old , right ?
ok . another person . oh , i forgot , i shouldn 't shuffle but i think -- -- actually , my technique is to peek , all the time .
maybe you will cut ? lift .
and now , when i lift this card , it shall be your card . what was your card ?
right , sorry , my -- i should have mentioned that , yeah .
so here , here i have to peek , lots of cards .
there was the place . and here is king of spades , correct ?
we try . yeah . you help me .
i look -- shake the cards , so i don 't .
so now i have to improvise again .
lg : yeah . also listen .
eight .
touch me , feel -- ah , ah , you know !
rob legato : i pretend they 're clapping for me .
so i showed him this , and this is actual footage that he was on . this is apollo 15 . this was his mission .
so here 's the behind the scenes , a couple of little shots here .
now , " hugo " was another interesting movie , because the movie itself is about film illusions .
what do you think was the reason ? "
so i thought , forget the rock opera , forget the bombast , my usual tricks .
and this great news gives birth to even more great news , because the historic trend is this .
there are all kinds of benefits to this .
you can tell politicians that these cuts [ can cost ] lives .
so i 'm here to -- i guess we 're here to try and infect you with this virtuous , data-based virus , the one we call factivism .
so i 'm going to talk about work , specifically why people can 't seem to get work done at work , which is a problem we all kind of have .
i 'll hear things like an extra room in the house , the basement , the coffee shop , the library .
i went to these meetings i was asked to go to .
so sleep is about sleep phases , or stages -- some people call them different things .
i understand . i know how this goes .
the real problems are what i like to call the m & amp ; ms , the managers and the meetings .
i mean , what are the chances that all 10 people are ready to stop ?
so i have some suggestions to remedy the situation .
and maybe , hopefully you can do it more often .
and i hope that some of these ideas were at least provocative enough for managers and bosses and business owners and organizers and people who are in charge of other people to think about laying off a little bit and giving people some more time to get some work done .
and every year i go there and make a map of my study site .
so this is a one-year-old colony -- this happens to be 536 .
there 's a lot of damage to the nest , and extra ants are needed to clean up that mess .
and then there 's another long tunnel and a chamber , where we often find the queen , after eight hours of hacking away at the rock with pickaxes .
now ants -- most ants , including these , don 't see very well .
and so just to summarize the result , well it turns out that yes , the different tasks are interdependent .
whereas the young , small colonies -- the two-year-old colonies of just 2,000 ants -- are much more variable .
so it has to know the difference between a forager and a nest maintenance worker .
and the second thing is that an ant 's ability to assess this pattern must be very crude because no ant can do any sophisticated counting .
and i thought , " great .
we have many initiatives that we 're working on , but some of them are very basic .
thank you .
jay walker : how many people are trying to learn english worldwide ?
s : i want to change my life !
i said , " where are the qataris ? "
you know the middle east is going crazy when lebanon is the most peaceful place in the region .
every country — iranians , sometimes we do two , sometimes we do three .
even if i 'm there with my friend named jack , i say , " greetings , jack . salutations , jack . "
and , you know , " excuse me ! "
because archaeology gives us an opportunity to study past civilizations , and see where they succeeded and where they failed .
so , this used to be completely smooth .
it 's got the huge advantage that it does not create carbon pollution .
and these happen to be my eyes , by the way .
it turns out there are real people who go out and search for extraterrestrials in a very scientific way .
now , to find dinosaurs , you hike around in horrible conditions looking for a dinosaur .
you know .
now , to a human audience , i need to explain that if penthouse magazine had a marine mammal edition , this would be the centerfold .
adrian kohler : well , we 're here today to talk about the evolution of a puppet horse .
bj : so every moment it 's on the stage , it 's making the struggle .
bj : so this production was seen by tom morris of the national theatre in london .
we had to throw out the plywood legs and make new cane ones .
the horses are completely handmade .
but he also controls the head directly by using his hand .
and it 's very , very simple because all that happens is that the puppeteer breathes with his knees .
bj : not being able to talk to one another while they 're onstage because they 're mic 'd .
but in that city , that tortured city , where you see the three faiths jostling so uneasily together , you also become aware of the profound connection between them .
and in particular , every single one of the major world traditions has highlighted -- has said -- and put at the core of their tradition what 's become known as the golden rule .
we formed you , says the quran , into tribes and nations so that you may know one another .
but people want to be religious , and religion should be made to be a force for harmony in the world , which it can and should be -- because of the golden rule .
that is the ethos found , too , in all the religions .
and as he did so , his customer noticed that on the back side of the balance wheel was an engraving , were words .
in fact , i 've never found anybody that doesn 't like the light that goes out slowly .
now i 'm not a neuroscientist .
look at that . what are you feeling about it ?
because i have to know how people react to things .
very hard to find . maybe you 've got some examples of it .
so i 'm going to shamelessly expose something to you , which is beautiful to me .
i 'm really getting into this now .
i moved three things by a millimeter .
and the one i showed you before was , of course , a massively complex one .
so is that wrong ?
only sometimes . only sometimes .
and i 'm very , very stoked — you guys are just applauding for everything . it 's great .
tedx .
my arabic 's reduced by now to wielding a dictionary , so i took four well-known translations and decided to read them side-by-side , verse-by-verse along with a transliteration and the original seventh-century arabic .
but all is not lost in translation .
and that number 72 never appears .
the second is insuring that there is systematic early access to counsel .
i used to think , well is it cambodia ?
i met with one of the development agencies , and they were training prosecutors and judges , which is the normal bias , as opposed to defenders .
and on december 4 , he organized three thousand members of the youth communist league , from 14 of the top law schools , who organized themselves , developed posters with the new laws , and went to the police stations and began what he says is a non-violent legal revolution to protect citizen rights .
and i will do the one thing that i can do . "
this is -- i put it down at the bottom , but that was extemporaneous , obviously .
so if anybody here has trouble with the concept of design humility , reflect on this -- it took us 5,000 years to put wheels on our luggage .
we 've seen the first form of solar energy that 's beat the hegemony of fossil fuels in the form of wind here in the great plains , and so that hegemony is leaving .
you can 't farm the same piece of ground for 40 centuries without understanding nutrient flow .
so we 're looking for the design rules of this -- this is the highest biodiversity of trees in the world , irian jaya , 259 species of tree , and we described this in the book , " cradle to cradle . "
so when we see e equals mc squared come along , from a poet 's perspective , we see energy as physics , chemistry as mass , and all of a sudden , you get this biology .
so the biological nutrients , the first fabrics -- the water coming out was clean enough to drink .
the country -- the home of biological . and putting them together .
we then take the parks and lay them out as ecological infrastructure .
at the time , these words were earmarked and targeted against the british , but over the last 200 years , they 've come to embody what many westerners believe , that freedom is the most cherished value , and that the best systems of politics and economics have freedom embedded in them .
however , i am saying that on balance , they worry more about where their living standard improvements are going to come from , and how it is their governments can deliver for them , than whether or not the government was elected by democracy .
now this is something that people can see and point to .
what this says is that for people like me who care about liberal democracy , is we 've got to find a more sustainable way of ensuring that we have a sustainable form of democracy in a liberal way , and that has its roots in economics .
it 's the refrigerators .
so , a funny thing happened on my way to becoming a brilliant , world-class neuropsychologist : i had a baby .
and i know that kids get concussed every year .
the definition of concussion doesn 't actually require a loss of consciousness .
how can we 100 percent guarantee the safety of our kids ?
it died in large part because it lacked constituent buy-in ; it lacked stakeholder traction .
like them , many species of whales saw their numbers drastically reduced by 200 years of whaling , where they were hunted and killed for their whale meat , oil and whale bone .
as these carcasses sink , they provide a feast to some 400-odd species , including the eel-shaped , slime-producing hagfish .
and that 's in fact probably what i 'm going to try and tell you about .
so this is interesting in the sense that you can now do " if-then-for " statements in materials , in structure .
can we get complex 3d structure automatically assembling in inorganic systems ?
well , it turns out biology has this other very interesting meme , that you can take a linear string , which is a convenient thing to copy , and you can fold that into an arbitrarily complex 3d structure .
this is a machine where you literally define a boundary condition .
so this is now a rope that knows the load on the rope at any particular point in the rope .
but it 's definitely an interesting new worldview .
the rigors of military medicine are not so dissimilar from the third world -- poor resources , a rigorous environment , a series of problems in lightweight , and things of this kind -- and also not so different from the home healthcare and diagnostic system world .
the fluid wicks its way into those chambers at the top .
and the answer is , of course , yes .
so , it 's a solved problem , that particular problem is solved .
" have you taken it every day ? " " yes . "
it turns out there 's an enormous amount of information already available on that subject , which is the mars rover problem .
here is an example of a slightly more complicated device .
here is another example of something which is -- this is a little spectrophotometer .
they also had taken out numerous patents on essential parts of the airplane .
there were countries that did not recognize pharmaceutical product patents , such as india , and indian pharmaceutical companies started to produce so-called generic versions , low-cost copies of antiretroviral medicines , and make them available in the developing world , and within a year the price had come down from 10,000 dollars per patient per year to 350 dollars per patient per year , and today that same triple pill cocktail is available for 60 dollars per patient per year , and of course that started to have an enormous effect on the number of people who could afford access to those medicines .
it isn 't only the number of drugs that are patented .
today , nelson otwoma is healthy .
nowadays this idea has a dramatic name : spaceship earth .
well , not quite , not quite perfect -- you see , in intergalactic space -- intergalactic space is completely dark , pitch dark .
the one physical system , the brain , contains an accurate working model of the other -- the quasar .
because imagine a cube out there in intergalactic space , the same size as our home , the solar system . now that cube is very empty by human standards , but that still means that it contains over a million tons of matter .
i think he 's going to talk about that later in the conference .
the world is buzzing at the moment with plans to force reductions in gas emissions at all costs .
we are going to watch " afghan star . " we are late .
but , once she started to win , then they got behind her again .
and one of the first things that i started to investigate was the history of the name of technology .
even the hunter-gatherers used some elementary tools .
and that 's why they didn 't live very long .
so , we 've invented ourselves . of all the animals that we have domesticated , the most important animal that we 've domesticated has been us . okay ?
and flowers and plants are the same thing , extended , and technology is basically an extension of life .
it has an urge , and technology has an urge .
we fix it , but most importantly , we relocate it .
we pay a price for that , but we are aware of it , and generally we will pay the price for increased freedoms , choices and opportunities .
this is a song about a creature called a hummingbird moth which imitates another creature which imitates yet another creature .
we want to get in as many songs as possible during our brief time here so this is the one to play .
do you have a laminated badge , eleanor ?
today , we know that this future vision didn 't come true .
what about the data and communication software which we need in the future ?
so we see a bottom-up approach here , because all the information , as i said , are inside the dna .
well , normally , a charity starts with the cause , and someone that is directly affected by a cause .
and i started to research that topic , and discovered prostate cancer is the male equivalent of breast cancer in terms of the number of men that die from it and are diagnosed with it .
let me tell you that there 's not too many people interested in investing in that , not even the prostate cancer foundation , who we 'd raised about 1.2 million dollars for at that stage .
so that year really taught us the importance of being patient and really understanding the local market before you become so bold as to set lofty targets .
and he said , " i 'm doing it for movember . " and i said , " so am i. " and i said , " tell me your movember story . "
we fund prostate cancer foundations now in 13 countries .
one figure for that : 54 percent of the children under the age of five years suffer from malnutrition .
they did not want to do this , it just happened -- they lost control .
so , i was able to launch a three-year project with caritas germany , and we trained 30 afghan women and men , and we opened 15 counseling centers in kabul .
so here you see , this is a health facility in northern afghanistan , and every morning it looks like this all over .
or maybe you 're in your living room , you know , playing with the wii with the kids , or something like that , and , you know , there 's this whole range of games , and that 's very much what i think about .
i was the head of a college department teaching games , so , again , it was sort of a real job , and now i just got to talk about making as opposed to making them .
anyways , so i asked her , " how do you feel about that ? "
after a month she says to me , " did this really happen ? "
this is a game with 50,000 individual pieces .
i put salad bars in all of our schools when i got there .
so we talked to kids about that , and we really start to feed kids regional food .
the usda cannot be seen as the be-all and end-all of what we feed our kids and what 's allowed .
the cdc , the center for disease control , has said , of the children born in the year 2000 -- those seven- and eight-year-olds today -- one out of every three caucasians , one out of every two african-americans and hispanics are going to have diabetes in their lifetime .
now , i said i 'm doing this in berkeley , and you might think , " oh , berkeley . of course you can do it in berkeley . "
in fact , this may be what a lot of parents serve , as opposed to -- this is what we try and serve .
and these calendars really started to lay out my program .
you know , we have to change it .
we really need to change it .
you know , it 's crazy . it 's crazy what we 're doing .
one gourmet coffee , one , is more -- we spend more on than we are spending to feed kids for an entire week in our schools .
and yet , they do it in a very different way .
has anyone of you heard of ferrofluid ?
and at the same time , it tries to maintain its position above the magnet , and therefore , it creates those amazing-looking structures of channels and tiny little ponds of colorful water paint .
it goes really fast , and it 's not that impressive .
that is , we don 't just get a few more questions right on i.q. tests .
now what we have to imagine is the mental artillery that we have picked up over those hundred years , and i think again that another thinker will help us here , and that 's luria .
and the fellow said , " well , if it 's large enough , there ought to be camels there . "
you can 't do science without proposing hypotheses .
the professions have been upgraded .
as an irishman , he hated the english so much he didn 't have much emotion for anyone else .
you have to say , well , blackness of skin , you couldn 't suffer just for that .
that is , they had moved so far from the concrete world that they could even ignore the appearance of the symbols that were involved in the question .
and what i want to talk to you about today is what that gift is , and i also want to explain to you why it is that it hasn 't made a damn bit of difference .
it was very easy to remember seeing dogs , not so easy to remember pigs . and each one of you assumed that if dogs on leashes came more quickly to your mind , then dogs on leashes are more probable .
they don 't come quickly to mind , and as a result , we vastly underestimate them .
do you want it ? most people won 't play this lottery .
when people are asked about these two different jobs : a job where you make 60k , then 50k , then 40k , a job where you 're getting a salary cut each year , and one in which you 're getting a salary increase , people like the second job better than the first , despite the fact they 're all told they make much less money . why ?
well , of course , i went to the theater to see the play .
if you 're a smart retailer , then , you will put a very expensive item that nobody will ever buy on the shelf , because suddenly the $ 33 wine doesn 't look as expensive in comparison .
now , let 's imagine instead you wanted to buy a car that had a stereo , and the dealer near your house had it for 31,000 .
what are the odds that years later you 'll turn on the stereo and go , " sounds so much better than those little ones , " which you can 't even remember hearing .
what makes this dynamic inconsistency happen ?
watch what happens when we drop some out .
dan gilbert : i actually was consulting recently with the department of homeland security , which generally believes that american security dollars should go to making borders safer .
so there are a number of things that together make this seem like a fantastic event , but let 's not play down the fact that newspapers sell when people see something in it they want to read . so there 's a large role here played by the media , who want these things to be as spectacular as they possibly can .
if that turns out to be wrong , we all look silly , but with poverty it 's a bit -- even if that were true , still more people die from poverty .
now , economists tend to -- -- economists tend to view the world through their own lenses , which is : this is just a bunch of stupid people .
so , would you like to have an extra 100,000 dollars when you 're 65 is a question that 's very different than , imagine who you 'll be when you 're 65 : will you be living , what will you look like , how much hair will you have , who will you be living with .
he had a gargantuan ego .
celebrity sandwiches was their thing .
and what did we talk about ?
dick and i had a certain , a little bit of a rapport .
he was a master mechanic , and he taught me how to use tools .
but let me tell you a little bit about feynman the physicist .
he would try to visualize it , guided by a small number of simple principles .
you simply take the proton , and you hit it really sharply with an electron .
you just get to think of it as a population of frozen partons .
there 's no suggestion of a relationship there .
they 're all weighted equally .
it 's simply the proportion of the population who agree most people can be trusted .
it goes from 15 homicides per million up to 150 .
they 're all problems that tend to be more common at the bottom of the social gradient .
there seems to be some truth in john donne 's " no man is an island . "
interestingly , some parallel work going on in social psychology : some people reviewed 208 different studies in which volunteers had been invited into a psychological laboratory and had their stress hormones , their responses to doing stressful tasks , measured .
and indeed , people know the causal links quite well in some of these outcomes .
on top of this , when you get so many animals so close together , it creates a breeding ground for disease and opportunities for harm and abuse .
we then isolate the skin cells and multiply them in a cell culture medium .
what could the future of animal products look like ?
and today , 45 years later , we clearly have no less need for this kind of clarity and perspective , but what we do have is improved technology .
now this piece is currently in process -- due out in may -- but what we 've done is we 've put together a small demo , just to show the geometric translation of points into a sphere .
now , we 've known for a long time the cause of diarrhea .
what 's going on here ?
you get it , either in pill form or you get it as an injection ; you have to take it every day to maintain your blood sugar levels .
and the inconsistencies create , fundamentally , this last mile problem .
i don 't think that 's stupid .
if the ball costs 10 , the bat costs ...
ready ? go .
" i could give people numbers . we do well on crash tests . "
researchers have found these type of anomalies .
maybe it 's the diarrhea .
this is from a company called positive energy .
how much are we putting into energy behavior change in a credible , systematic , testing way ?
sm : so , the scientific method i alluded to is pretty important .
so when you think about your parents or your grandparents , at best they may have created some photos or home videos , or a diary that lives in a box somewhere .
now we 're already starting to see some experiments here .
and then sort of through a process of wandering around , i got to the thought that actually if you could convert an entire country to electric cars , in a way that is convenient and affordable , you could get to a solution .
and so the first thought that came to mind is , everywhere we park we have electric power .
everybody tells us batteries are so expensive .
those of you who have a hard time calculating what that means -- in the average consumer environment we 're in in the u.s.
peres thought that was a great idea .
if you fail the iq test they ask you to leave the country .
the foundation of this curve is that we keep losing the wells that are close to the ground .
and that 's the difference between problems that are additive , like co2 , which we go slowly up and then we tip , and problems that are depletive , in which we lose what we have , which oscillate , and they oscillate until we lose everything we 've got .
we 're the only ones who don 't have the price set right .
we said , " no no , but what if we prove it ? "
and there will be about a 20 percent chance we 'll recover him .
so let 's get to what i would like , which is world peace .
you can 't force people of free will , and i totally support that .
it was my first exhibit of photographs and they were all put up there , and after about two days , they all came down except for three .
i had somebody bring it there because i wanted to get access to al jazeera , george bush 's favorite channel and a place which i was very curious about because it 's disliked by many governments across the arab world and also called the mouthpiece of osama bin laden by some people in the u.s. government .
it made me sick to my stomach .
al jazeera offered him a job .
there is no paradise ! it only exists in your head !
tzvika : i said , " ok , that 's bat-chen , that 's my daughter .
death unto apartheid ! "
i 'd like for us to imagine for a second -- imagine a day when you have everyone coming together from around the world .
and we called that landmass pangea .
and so sebastian bought squeak to protect his reputation .
sebastian actually said to me , he said , " thirteen former guests contacted me before my own mother rang . "
now , later that evening , the two self-confessed tech geeks starting talking about how cool it would be if some kind of ebay for errands existed .
in a similar way that companies often use some kind of credit rating to decide whether to give you a mobile plan , or the rate of a mortgage , marketplaces that depend on transactions between relative strangers need some kind of device to let you know that sebastian and chris are good eggs , and that device is reputation .
it 's a bit like when i moved from new york to sydney .
ultimately , when we get it right , reputation capital could create a massive positive disruption in who has power , trust and influence .
he 's turning 50 this year , and he 's convinced that the rich tapestry of reputation he 's built on airbnb will lead him to doing something interesting with the rest of his life .
and i think that is indeed what architecture is . it is a story .
and yet that energy and power of architecture has driven an entire social and political space that these buildings occupy .
it 's actually a story in which our acts themselves are pushing the story in a particular way .
it 's a language . but it is not a language that can be reduced to a series of programmatic notes that we can verbally write .
and yet , our lives are complex .
it 's the real that we touch -- the door , the window , the threshold , the bed -- such prosaic objects . and yet , i try , in every building , to take that virtual world , which is so enigmatic and so rich , and create something in the real world .
so architecture maybe is not so big , like science , but through its focal point it can leverage in an archimedian way what we think the world is really about .
it can reach into millennia that have been buried , and return them in a just and unexpected equity .
and there of course is the space that we need to breathe , is the space we need to dream .
i think nothing good will come out of that .
thank you so much , daniel libeskind .
but as particular as they feel to us , we know we 're not alone .
now , go to youtube , facebook ; you have worldwide distribution without leaving the privacy of your own bedroom .
business leadership will depend more and more on emotional intelligence , the ability to listen deeply , to have empathy , to articulate change , to motivate others -- the very capacities that the arts cultivate with every encounter .
transportation walls came tumbling down .
and we can see the tragedy of africa in the first few bars here .
if you had to choose , which would you rather have : the common disease or the rare disease ?
that 's one reason .
but in this century china is coming on line .
even at that rate , by 2100 average gdp per capita in the world will be $ 200,000 .
alright . what else ?
thank you .
it did mine .
and i said , " why ? "
so i started doing that .
so that if you sit down on my chair , whether you 're five feet tall or six foot six , it always deals with your weight and transfers the amount of force required to recline in a way that you don 't have to look for something to adjust .
anyway , i felt that it was important that you didn 't have to make an adjustment in order to get this kind of action .
there 's two of them , one on either side .
ideally you want to put the head support in the cranial area , right there .
earlier this year , a virtual asteroid in it sold for 330,000 real dollars .
it 's a very great pleasure to fly around .
this sounds immensely boring but games are able to make this process incredibly compelling .
and also , we say , " well , how many monsters ? should i have the entire world full of a billion monsters ? "
the first one is very simple : experience bars measuring progress -- something that 's been talked about brilliantly by people like jesse schell earlier this year .
now this is the neurological goldmine , if you like , because a known reward excites people , but what really gets them going is the uncertain reward , the reward pitched at the right level of uncertainty , that they didn 't quite know whether they were going to get it or not .
and i want to tell you a quick story about 1999 -- a video game called everquest .
we can reward effort consistently as everything fields together .
and then from that point on , you 're basically falling .
rule number five : know how to rest .

camaguey is a province in cuba .
there 's stories that you may tell in a small group of people with some good wine .
i called my mother , and she said , " carmen , i need you to come , please .
i show up . she 's in the carport .
her daughter , me , the village idiot with the ice cream cone in the middle of her forehead , is still standing there , slack-jawed .
so , i think , hey , we can talk . it 'll be a diversion .
he gave you a ticket ? he didn 't give you a ticket ? what ? "
" it won 't upset me . why ? what ? is something wrong with him ? "
we 're doing great . we 're doing fine .
when she writes the expose in about 20 years , don 't believe a word of it .
i don 't know what part of the country you live in .
" que ? " which means " what , " and so much more .
i said , " no , i follow little old women around parking lots to see if they 'll stop . yes , it 's my mother ! "
what i mean by psychopathic killer are these people , these types of people .
and in fact this is probably why mostly men , boys , are psychopathic killers , or are very aggressive .
she then told me about our own family tree .
and they all seemed to be ok .
you know , in the military , they give medals to people who are willing to sacrifice themselves so that others may gain .
nothing personal .
so i said something .
if you get a job at next jump , you cannot get fired for performance issues .
bob believes in heart counts , and it 's much more difficult to simply reduce the heart count .
they will give us their blood and sweat and tears to see that their leader 's vision comes to life , and when we ask them , " why would you do that ?
it 's important to show not just to show the leader , but the followers , because you find that new followers emulate the followers , not the leader .
each of you possesses the most powerful , dangerous and subversive trait that natural selection has ever devised .
and if they really were intelligent , why would they crack open nuts with a rock ?
we can learn by watching other people and copying or imitating what they can do .
and so some time around 200,000 years ago , our species confronted this crisis .
and let 's pretend the other one is good at language skills .
it is the most valuable trait we have for converting new lands and resources into more people and their genes that natural selection has ever devised .
now we have to counter that , though , against the evidence we 've heard that we might have had some rather distasteful genetic dalliances with the neanderthals and the denisovans .
and we see this in the inexorable march towards standardization .

and there 's a day 's worth of our cups .
and do you remember the response ?
this is a piece that i just recently completed about another tragic phenomenon . and that is the phenomenon , this growing obsession we have with breast augmentation surgery .
and if we can find that , then we 'll be able to find , within each one of us , what it is that we need to find to face the big question , which is : how do we change ?
every year , 36,000 people in the united states die of seasonal flu .
well , here 's the dirty little secret .
by that time , the battle against hiv would already have been lost .
the virus that causes aids is the trickiest pathogen scientists have ever confronted .
so what we 've got is a situation .
if you can cripple these with specific antibodies , you could cripple all versions of the flu .
the system is reliable but the problem is you never know how well a strain is going to grow .
india , mexico and others are already making experimental flu vaccines , and they may be the first place we see these vaccines in use .
and with these types of antibodies , we know humans can make them .
we still have one foot in the dark ages .
and if you hefted those two things you might find that the relative scale of those is 20 to 1 .
you notice that jim cameron is sitting in a seat .
right now , i 'm just coming down on this gorgeous , big , giant manta ray .
really that 's the only real dive i 've ever made in this machine .
she wanted to dance .
thank you .
i work on the issue of commercial sexual exploitation .
they 're killed ; we don 't even hear about them .
it 's in that context that i rescue children .
what has been my challenge ?
if i 'm here today , i 'm here not only as sunitha krishnan .
thank you .
this is an oxford-trained economist steeped in humanistic values , and yet he agrees with the high-pressure tactics of shanghai .
after the country reported very impressive statistics on telephones , the country collapsed .
is democracy bad for economic growth ?
and they all tell you , " yes , we have won the lottery . "
and this is the earliest data that i can find .
today , indian women have a sizable life expectancy edge over indian men .
in terms of the political changes , they have introduced village elections .
in fact , if you compare india with the average developing country , even before the more recent period of acceleration of indian growth -- now india is growing between eight and nine percent -- even before this period , india was ranked fourth in terms of economic growth among emerging economies .
one is the focused ultrasound , and the other one is the vision-enabled magnetic resonance imaging .
and you know also about lithotripsy -- breaking kidney stones .
john is a retired professor of history from virginia .
this is the only device he needs in this treatment .
this is the outcome from a patient perspective -- same day after the treatment .
he 's back to his normal life .
he rides his horse to their mountain cabin regularly .
and this will take time .
we are drowning in news .
what about resources ? how are we going to feed nine billion people ?
" pro-speras , " " speras , " hope -- in accordance with our hopes and expectations .
in the world i describe to you , we have to be right over here at the right-hand side at six grams of carbon .
we love new stuff -- new material stuff for sure -- but also new ideas , new adventures , new experiences .
is this really how people are ?
you can hear the five-year-old mind working .
so here , all of a sudden , we 're looking at a map of the human heart .
in case anyone out there is looking for a job in a recession , that 's the page to go to .
what can we offer those people ?
tim jackson : well that 's clearly not what you 're doing .
many years ago , when i was born in the ' 50s -- ' 50s and ' 60s didn 't belong to girls in india .
one , they said , " life is on an incline .
this is something like a new definition ever given in policing in india -- the power to prevent .
normally police officers don 't want to do prison .
government had no budget .
this was one of the most courageous steps i took as a prison governor .
i 'm currently into movements , movements of education of the under-served children , which is thousands -- india is all about thousands .
haiti allowed us to glimpse into a future of what disaster response might look like in a hyper-connected world where people have access to mobile smart devices .
it has been used to help communities prepare for disasters .
if you were to arrive in nairobi today and pick up a tourist map , kibera is represented as a lush , green national park devoid of human settlement .
and not only is it empowering to the communities , but really importantly , this information stays in the community where it is needed to formulate long-term health polices .
thank you very much .
and what we did on this is we analyzed the top 25 percent of these , and we started to see where the connections occurred , where they connected with each other .
if we split along gender lines , we can see females resonating heavily with food economy , but also out there in hope and optimism .
it 's literally defining a new field .
i show a number of photographs and films , but i also make television programs , books and some advertising , all with the same concept .
this is jane smith and jo bloggs , for instance , but you think it 's camilla and the queen , and i 'm fascinated how what you think is real isn 't necessarily real .
but then this changed suddenly .
because obviously it 's making a comment about our culture right now : that we can 't tell what 's real .
tony blair and cherie . and again , the legalities -- we had to be very careful .
and really commenting , you know , based on the perception we have of the celebrities .
but i should say that my background -- my father was , you know , raised to be an episcopalian and republican , but after one year of college , he became an atheist and a democrat .
so i first went to copenhagen because i thought , well , maybe i could become a biochemist , but i discovered biochemistry was very boring .
this is a photograph several years later , when bragg had cause to smile .
but about , oh , 15 months after i got to cambridge , a rumor began to appear from linus pauling 's son , who was in cambridge , that his father was now working on dna .
well , we got the answer on the 28th february ' 53 .
they said , we won 't think about it until we know it 's right .
and we knew , basically , dna provides the information for rna .
and now i have a sort of vested interest : i want to do it for prostate cancer . so , you know , you aren 't treated if it 's not dangerous .
and yet , in the controls there were three .
so what 's the problem , why has this chasm opened up , and what can we do to fix it ?
so let 's ask another question .
math is a much broader subject than calculating .
people say , " is such and such true ? "
i don 't think so .
and what 's worse , what they 're learning there isn 't even practically useful anymore .
well , another issue people bring up is somehow that hand calculating procedures teach understanding .
so calculus has traditionally been taught very late .
what does that do to the payments and to the interest rates and so forth ?
you can 't roll a stop sign in cambridge without hitting a graduate student .
but what it means is that we fail to identify a greasy pocket in these proteins , into which we , like molecular locksmiths , can fashion an active , small , organic molecule or drug substance .
now this is a very rare cancer , this brd4-addicted cancer .
and on the animal on the right , you see that the cancer was responding .
what this research taught us -- not just my lab , but our institute , and harvard medical school more generally -- is that we have unique resources in academia for drug discovery -- that our center that has tested perhaps more cancer molecules in a scientific way than any other , never made one of its own .
now the business model involves all of you .
so how do we actually ask them the question ?
and what 's more , they felt that they should actually do things to help other people get what they wanted .
whereas the chickens are actually mature within a couple of months .
we don 't have to do anything . all we have to do is learn .
this is reverend bayes 's notebook .
but unconsciously , they 're doing these quite complicated calculations that will give them a conditional probability measure .
boy : that 's why .
now here 's what we know about how adult consciousness works .
that 's a fantastic way to be , but it does tend to leave you waking up crying at three o 'clock in the morning .
they also practiced a clown act when the future of furniture was not nearly as auspicious as it turned out to be .
so that was just a little snip .
it was that hands-on iterative process which is so much like vernacular design and folk design in traditional cultures .
and i was very touched by dean kamen 's work for the military , or for the soldiers , because charles and ray designed a molded plywood splint . this is it .
here 's a film we 've been hearing things about .
it was part of the quality of life .
sun ? no . well is there another name for a sunrise ?
kymaerica with waterfalls , tumbling through our -- ed : this is one of the traditional kymaerican songs .
it 's a film about maya gretel , a famous ceramicist , and a teacher at cranbrook .
and a little bit higher , why they have a glaze on a thing they call a thali .
all that great thinking needs to really get about solving pretty key problems .
they begin to be attracted towards earth .
this is cultures , identical cultures , of cervical cancer cells .
the expected five year survival is less than five percent .
and he received first-line chemotherapy .
but what we can see is , by month six , the tumor has responded and it 's begun to melt away .
she 's interacting with her kids and her grand kids .
when he arches his back , he gains altitude .
yves , welcome . it is quite amazing .
so i 'm kind of curious , what 's your top speed ?
for example , last winter i began with kite surfing -- so new things .
and this is my life .
this is risky stuff indeed .
yr : i do a roll .
yr : first , to instruct a younger guy .
it gets worse .
so what do we know about complex systems ?
and the links represent the shareholding relations , so shareholder a has x percent of the shares in company b.
and it turns out to be structured as follows .
it 's actually not that hard to understand .
we 're seeing the emergence of long-term and highly-funded programs which aim at understanding our networked world from a complexity point of view .
his mother showed up the next week at my brother 's classroom and begged seven-year-old kids to share with her any picture they may have of her son , for she had lost everything .
it 's too painful . you don 't want to think about it .
the front of wars is increasingly non-human eyes peering down on our perceived enemies from space , guiding missiles toward unseen targets , while the human conduct of the orchestra of media relations in the event that this particular drone attack hits a villager instead of an extremist .
and in order for us to understand how do we build lasting peace , we must understand war and peace from both sides .
she got a support network .
let us all meet in that field .
if you look at the y-axis of this graph , you 'll see that , in the mechanically ventilated air , you have a higher probability of encountering a potential pathogen , or germ , than if you 're outdoors .
everyone needs a coach .
so i looked at the countries whose students perform well academically , and looked at what they 're doing to help their teachers improve .
what would that system look like ?
okay , so i would like you to please bring up your papers .
but we still have more work to do .
and it 's a journey that you and i have been on for many years now , and it began some 50 years ago , when humans first stepped off our planet .
its atmosphere is largely molecular nitrogen , like you are breathing here in this room , except that its atmosphere is suffused with simple organic materials like methane and propane and ethane .
and yet another moon there -- i don 't even know which one it is . it 's a very extensive atmosphere .
it was a tremendously emotional event , and it 's something that i will personally never forget , and you shouldn 't either .
.
it is a very geologically active body .
and in this impossibly beautiful picture , you see the main rings backlit by the sun , you see the refracted image of the sun and you see this ring created , in fact , by the exhalations of enceladus .
i do actually feel more alien the longer i live there .
because when my grandparents were born , they pretty much had their sense of home , their sense of community , even their sense of enmity , assigned to them at birth , and didn 't have much chance of stepping outside of that .
or edinburgh .
and as he had it , even the most restless , distractible , testosterone-addled 15-year-old californian boy only had to spend three days in silence and something in him cooled down and cleared out .
i looked at the clouds , and i did what is hardest of all for me to do usually , which is nothing at all .
so , who am i ?
children with cleft palates will get it , and they document their story . this is wonderful .
and my husband -- this is my husband , who is very hot -- he won an award for being hot -- -- he told me , " you cannot buy a banjo .
i 'm like , i don 't want to write this anymore , and i slowly and slowly -- and i did tell personal stories from time to then .
you have day nine -- they 're talking about his apnea ; day 39 -- he gets pneumonia .
but to see something like the $ 100 computer is amazing , because it 's a -- blogging software is simple .
and he 's basically taking a picture of his family everyday for the past , what is ' 76 -- 20 , oh my god , i 'm ' 77 -- 29 years ? twenty-nine years .
and her sister came on , and she said that emma had passed away . and all of our support staff who had talked to her were really emotional , and it was a very hard day at the company .
she is not she , but a buttercup .
now , synesthesia is the experience of a stimulus in once sense organ in another sense organ as well , such as colored hearing .
you can take the test now .
they may feel confident , say , in taking out mortgages they really can 't afford .
ralph waldo emerson described language as " fossil poetry . "
is bill gates here ?
i 'll go through a little of them . bolotnitsa .

" yeah , that 's the goat goddess right ? the abacazanian ?
" mom , i want to make maps . "
he 's got no body , no man , just a head floating high .
so , you can kind of get an idea from this extrapolating that back under this huge picture , so we get this idea of what the primal universe looked like .
i don 't get that at all .
because that 's why we 're here , really , i think to figure stuff out and to love each other .
prime numbers , gauss , one of my favorites .
you can see , even if you don 't go for the numbers , the beauty of the symmetry .
twenty-seven years of my life !
i go to jpl .
we 've got to decide a process by which we decide .
so what we 'd like to propose is that we use them to involve people from all around the world in an historic first : the world 's first truly global poll and consultation , where everyone everywhere has an equal voice for the very first time .
long-term trends suggest that this century is going to be a tough place to live , with population increases , consumption patterns increasing , and conflict over scarce natural resources .
five thousand fewer children dying every day .
because that 's really the moment we really know what we 're made of .
and then we went to a fish restaurant , and we had chad , the surfer dude , serving us , and he came up and my mother said , " do you have any specials , young man ? "
can you imagine this five-foot-two woman , standing up to men with guns who want to kill us ?
when i was growing up in nigeria -- and i shouldn 't say nigeria , because that 's too general , but in afikpo , the igbo part of the country where i 'm from -- there were always rites of passage for young men .
of course , talking about goats makes me think of sheep , and not in good ways .
and so , i remember night after night , you 'd hear all these men , these really hardened criminals , huddled around john james , reciting , " take that , spidey ! "
all it requires is to recognize among us , every day -- the few of us that can see -- are surrounded by people like the ones i 've told you .
and that creates the front page . it 's always rising , falling , always changing .
so , it went from about five percent , which was when this meme started , to 70 percent at the end of voting .
but what was even more important was the fact that they actually accomplished their mission . the japanese government called off their whaling expedition . mission accomplished .
autism is a very big continuum that goes from very severe -- the child remains non-verbal -- all the way up to brilliant scientists and engineers .
rapid movement , contrast .
just really quickly , like google for pictures .
the red lines there are me , and the blue lines are the sex and age-matched control .
you know , it 's going to be variable .
in other words , categorize equipment problem from a people problem .
we 've got to work on developing all these different kinds of minds .
and the wolfram stuff -- i was taking notes and i was writing down all the search words i could use , because i think that 's going to go on in my autism lectures .
like if a kid loves racecars , let 's use racecars for math .
you 're getting that kid turned on .
if you have a two , three or four year old you know , no speech , no social interaction , i can 't emphasize enough : don 't wait , you need at least 20 hours a week of one-to-one teaching .
when we were talking on the phone , one of the things you said that really astonished me was you said one thing you were passionate about was server farms . tell me about that .
and what you can see straight away is you start to have a different relationship to the numbers .
we need to imagine what a landscape of the world 's fears might look like .
well , november , christmas video games come out , and there may well be an upsurge in the concern about their content .
what rises twice a year , once in easter and then two weeks before christmas , has a mini peak every monday , and then flattens out over the summer ?
and i 've never been to design school .
so a lot of your vision -- the bulk of it is visual , and it 's pouring in .
so , to be fair and to alter our perspective , we have to bring in another data set , and that data set is gdp , or the country 's earnings .
i love taking supplements and being fit , but i can never understand what 's going on in terms of evidence .
i think , " no , no . i don 't want to take any synthetics , i just want to see plants and -- just show me herbs and plants . i 've got all the natural ingredients . "
it feels like we have a lot of information problems in our society at the moment , from the overload and the saturation to the breakdown of trust and reliability and runaway skepticism and lack of transparency , or even just interestingness .
it was actually really inspiring to see all these egyptians completely changing .
there are lots of people who are frustrated .
because of the internet , the truth prevailed and everyone knew the truth .
and they were doing this thing .
and i 'm not going to talk about my experience , because this is not about me .
we are going to win because we don 't understand politics .
and so it 's not something -- happiness is not something you get , health is generally not something that you get .
clinically , he literally couldn 't walk across the street without getting severe chest pain ; within a month , like most people , was pain-free , and within a year , climbing more than 100 floors a day on a stairmaster .
everybody who smokes knows it 's not good for you , and still 30 percent of americans smoke -- 80 percent in some parts of the world . why do people do it ?
and these things occur within hours . this is a study : a high fat meal , and within one or two hours blood-flow is measurably less -- and you 've all experienced this at thanksgiving .
so , when you eat less fat , you eat fewer calories without having to eat less food .
it also helps reduce the risk of the most common cancers like breast , prostate and colon cancer .
now , we 're about to publish the first study looking at the effects of this program on prostate cancer , and , in collaboration with sloane-kettering and with ucsf .
friendship , altruism , compassion , service – all the perennial truths that we talked about that are part of all religion and all cultures -- once you stop trying to see the differences , these are the things in our own self-interest , because they free us from our suffering and from disease .
now i 'm head of a biomaterials lab , and i 'm really fascinated by the way that humans have used materials in really creative ways in the body over time .
if we look at this schematic , this is showing you what we think of as the typical tissue-engineering approach .
and so this is what we did , and the way we did it was by coming back to this typical tissue-engineering approach but actually thinking about it rather differently .
and i 'm just going to tell you , sometimes those contacts are very strange , slightly unexpected , and the very most interesting , let me put it that way , contact that i had , was actually from a team of american footballers that all wanted to have double-thickness skulls made on their head .
and so one of the things you can think about doing is actually making scaffolds with slightly different dimensions that might be able to surround your cells in 3d and give them a little bit more information .
we have described here in terms of the performance and the price .
and when i finished my ssc , the eleventh standard , i stood eleventh among 125,000 students .
and he said , " well , i won 't define the vehicle for you , but i will define the cost for you .
i mean , it was incredible innovation .
this is a photograph of a house and a driver and a car near my own home .
you have to design an artificial foot for such conditions .
an incredible story .
time for development -- it took around 10 years and 700 million dollars .
and you can see this indian psoriasis breakthrough obtained by this reverse form of [ unclear ] by doing things differently .
and therefore , you 're not talking about incremental innovation , you 're talking about disruptive innovation .
what was that ?
and then the paper burned .
lp : thank you very much .
an intransitive verb , such as " dine , " for example , can 't take a direct object .
how are these construals reflected in language ?
it 's exactly the same construction , but no muffins , no mice , nothing moving at all .
this kind of indirect speech is rampant in language .
if two friends have a reciprocal transaction , like selling a car , it 's well known that this can be a source of tension or awkwardness .
if the officer is honest , you get a huge penalty of being arrested for bribery .
for 4,000 years , we fished sustainably for this animal , and it 's evidenced in the art that we see from thousands of years ago .
and if it 's tunas you don 't care about , perhaps you might be interested that international long lines and pursing chase down tunas and bycatch animals such as leatherbacks , sharks , marlin , albatross .
and for the first time , we 're able to watch the journey of a tuna beneath the ocean using light and photons to measure sunrise and sunset .
so take a look at that animal .
and so what we get then from the pop-up satellite tag is we get away from having to have a human interaction to recapture the tag .
they 're coming together . that could be tuna sex -- and there it is .
it 's a free swimming shark with a satellite tag jumping after salmon , sending home its data .
but now with light-based geolocation tags that are very small , we can actually see these journeys .
and when we do and it swims , we see this magnificent bathymetry that the shark knows is there on its path as it goes from california to hawaii .
let me just ask you , to start with , this simple question : who invented the mountain bike ?
that 's the idea of creativity .
we like to think that invention is a sort of moment of creation : there is a moment of birth when someone comes up with an idea .
they take their leisure very seriously : they acquire skills ; they invest time ; they use technology that 's getting cheaper -- it 's not just the internet : cameras , design technology , leisure technology , surfboards , so on and so forth .
well , the first thing you can say , i think with certainty , is what yochai has said already -- is there is a great big struggle between those two organizational forms .
shock , horror : now , the readers want to be writers and publishers .
let me just give you one final example of what that means .
or you can get on a plane , fly to shanghai , queue up outside shanda 's offices -- cost probably 600 , 700 dollars -- and reclaim your character , get your history back .
what i call the human portion -- humans and their livestock and pets -- versus the natural portion -- all the other wild animals and just -- these are vertebrates and all the birds , etc . , in the land and air , not in the water . how does it balance ?
we can 't go into that today because there isn 't time -- it 's a broad subject . one thing for sure , in the future there is an essential feature -- necessary , but not sufficient -- which is doing more with less . we 've got to be doing things with more efficiency using less energy , less material .
the message from all these vehicles is that ideas and technology can be harnessed to produce remarkable gains in doing more with less -- gains that can help us attain a desirable balance between technology and nature . the stakes are high as we speed toward a challenging future .
pm : but now we 're trying to get the video . there we go .
pm : if you can pass it down when you 're done . yeah , i think -- i lost a little orientation ; i looked up into this light .
things are going on this decade , next decade ; it 's a very short time that we have to decide what we are going to do .
you hear about it all the time .
aging brings some rather remarkable improvements -- increased knowledge , expertise -- and emotional aspects of life improve .
how sad are you right now ?
maybe our neural centers in our brain are degraded such that we 're unable to process negative emotions anymore .
by 2015 , there will be more people in the united states over the age of 60 than under 15 .
when i was growing up in the ' 70s , the typical american spent one tenth of their income , american family , on transportation .
actually , oregonians spend more on alcohol than most other states , which may be a good thing or a bad thing , but it makes you glad they 're driving less .
do you live in a more walkable city or do you live in a less walkable city , or where in your city do you live ?
do you know where it 's three per 100,000 ?
until some economists said , you know , is that the right way to measure co2 ?
you don 't want to tell americans , god forbid , that they have to change their lifestyle .
for the next few minutes we 're going to talk about energy , and it 's going to be a bit of a varied talk .
there was one kind of peak oil in 1985 , when oil represented 50 percent of global energy supply .
i picked it up outside of marble falls , texas .
all the same , what 's different ?
the botanical names are in front of you .
it is also important for the environment , because the world 's energy requirements are expected to grow by 30 percent in the next decade .
and i opened it up , it said , " born in iran . " i 'm like , " oh , come on , man . "
but a lot of times in hollywood , when casting directors find out you 're of middle eastern descent , they go , " oh , you 're iranian . great .
i was watching the news . i 'm like , " am i involved in this crap ? "
i encourage people always to go visit these places .
and i 've taken my two year-old son to playgrounds all over the united states .
i go , " i 'm sorry . then why were you staring at me ? "
and an average user , said cameron marlow , from facebook , has about 120 friends .
but once a fortnight , they actually put the computer on their dining table , pull out the webcam and actually have dinner with their family in sao paulo . and they have a big event of it .
but basically , when you walked into those buildings , the private sphere was left behind you .
and actually , over these 150 years , there has been a very clear class system that also has emerged .
now i know that seems ludicrous .
it will let you down less , and not only that , it looks better .
you 're the chaplain .
yes , you are going to make some big changes in your life , and now you 're going to start thinking about your death .
we don 't all have to start a foundation or an organization or write a book or make a documentary .
what it means today may not be what it means a year from now , or 10 years from now .
and she ended her story with , " i felt crucified . "
and i believe that for us , being in the tomb means doing our own deep inner work around our wounds and allowing ourselves to be healed .
however , i 've found that listening to a computer voice for any great length of time can be monotonous .
and before i left the hospital , after a year of being hospitalized , i had seven ruptures of my carotid artery .
when people hear alex speaking my words , do they experience a disconnect ?
i 'll let you hear a sample of that voice .
roger ebert : as you can hear , it sounds like me , but the words jump up and down .
as a local newspaper reporter still in high school , i was sent over to the computer lab of the university of illinois to interview the creators of something called plato .
ce : all of this has happened in the blink of an eye .
while harvesting tissue from both my shoulders , the surgeries left me with back pain and reduced my ability to walk easily .
google him and he will make you laugh .
let 's just get started here .
and those resources are going away .
and you want to go towards iron if you want to get energy .
there is one trickiness about this reaction .
and breeder technology is fast breeders . and that 's pretty dangerous .
but that 's not really fusion power . that 's just making some fusion happen .
i wish we had more money , i wish we had more resources .
but these laws , when applied to people living with hiv , are a violation of international human rights agreements to which these countries are signatories .
these laws respect universal human rights and they are grounded in evidence .
and this is exactly what happened to helma and dongo from namibia .
there are many reasons for these positive developments , but one of the most remarkable is in the increase in the number of people around the world on anti-retroviral therapy , the medicines they need to keep their hiv in check .
where the legal environment allows for harm reduction the results are striking .
because civil society is key to raising awareness among vulnerable groups of their legal rights .
in my continued exploration of subjects in nature that have the ability to illustrate the interconnection of all life , i started storm chasing in 2008 after my daughter said , " mom , you should do that . "
and the bottom line of why i 'm here , besides being a crazy mofo , is that i 'm really in a position -- i 'm not here to motivate you , obviously ; you don 't need that .
what makes the difference in their performance ? "
and then you meet people that have been through ultimate pain -- psychologically , sexually , spiritually , emotionally abused -- and not always , but often , they become some of the people that contribute the most to society .
you may not have the money ; you may not have the supreme court ; but that is not the defining factor .
in this second , consciously or unconsciously , the minute you decide to focus on something you 've got to give it a meaning , and whatever that meaning is produces emotion .
what shapes you ? two invisible forces . very quickly . one : state .
and then there 's the fuel you pick . so very quickly , six needs .
whatever it takes . the fastest way to do this , if you have no background , no culture , no belief and resources or resourcefulness , is violence . if i put a gun to your head and i live in the ' hood , instantly i 'm significant .
because the sixth need is to contribute beyond ourselves .
so , i don 't tell you that to brag ; i tell you because i 'm proud of human beings , because they get excited to contribute once they 've had the chance to experience it , not talk about it .
she said , " it 's over . " when i finished that night , she called him and left a message -- true story -- at the top of the world trade center where he worked , saying , " honey , i love you , i just want you to know i want to marry you . it was stupid of me . " she was asleep , because it was 3 a.m. for us , when he called her back from the top and said , " honey , i can 't tell you what this means . "
i was listed on the online biography that said i was a design missionary .
but i began looking at design in a place like amsterdam and recognized , you know , the first job of design is to serve a social purpose .
red is a color in the landscape that is often on stop signs .
it 's quite free of commercial clutter : you don 't see our logos and brands and names , and therefore you 're alert to things physically .
and i don 't know if there 's a stronger kind of effect than pattern and the way it unites kind of disparate elements .
you would expect a city like this to have upgraded flower boxes on michigan avenue where wealthy people shop , but if you actually go along the street you find the flower boxes change from street to street : there 's actual diversity in the plants .
genomics at this stage of the thinking from a little over 10 years ago was , by the end of this year , we might have between three and five genomes sequenced ; it 's on the order of several hundred .
just on the data collection side , just where we are through the galapagos , we 're finding that almost every 200 miles , we see tremendous diversity in the samples in the ocean .
this is actually just a microorganism .
people immediately jump to concerns about biological warfare , and i had recent testimony before a senate committee , and a special committee the u.s. government has set up to review this area .
and here 's that same dna automatically reassembled 24 hours later .
we delayed the start of our experiments in 1999 until we completed a year-and-a-half bioethical review as to whether we should try and make an artificial species .
we used a computer vision tracking system in order to know where they were .
it 's calvino 's idea of the quickest way between two points is the circuitous line , not the straight line .
and i 'd been extremely interested in this notion of randomness as it produces architectural work and as it definitely connects to the notion of the city , an accretional notion of the city , and that led to various ideas of organization .
its position , of course , in the middle of manhattan -- it 's on hunter 's point .
and you 're looking at how it drapes over and differentiates from the body .
but we took the air conditioning out of the tower .
and there it is , again , as it 's starting to get resolved tectonically , and then there 's the school .
and again we just finished the ecb -- actually coop himmelblau in vienna just won this project , where the building was separated into a series of landscape elements that became part of a connective tissue of a park , which is parallel to the river , and develops ideas of the buildings themselves and becomes part of the connective fabric -- the social , cultural and the landscape , recreational fabric of the city .
we construct it and we construct those ideas .
the hanging chain models of antonio gaudi , the catalan architect .
to just talk for a minute about the digital mediums that we 're using now and how they integrate calculus : the fact that they 're calculus-based means that we don 't have to think about dimension in terms of ideal units or discreet elements .
i think that 's one of the main changes , also , in architecture : that we 're starting to look now not for some ideal form , like a latin cross for a church , but actually all the traits of a church : so , light that comes from behind from an invisible source , directionality that focuses you towards an altar .
so , as manufacturing starts to allow more design options , this problem gets exacerbated , of the whole and the parts .
in a housing project in valencia , spain , we 're doing , the different towers of housing fused together in shared curves so you get a single mass , like a kind of monolith , but it breaks down into individual elements .
i was asked to come here and speak about creation .
it was very -- actually , it was a very good study , and got me a job in an ad agency .
this is the clown skull .
" the teapot . "
so this is a lighthouse .
i used the dust at the whitney museum to render some pieces of their collection .
i opt for very simple line drawings -- kind of stupid looking .
that 's why we pay to go to magic shows and things like that .
but after three trips to antarctica , i decided that it might be nicer to work in warmer water .
and i said , " yeah .
it was an ecosystem . parrotfish spawning -- this is about 5,000 longnose parrotfish spawning at the entrance to one of the phoenix islands .
they control 3.4 million cubic miles of ocean , and that 's between one and two percent of all the ocean water on the planet .
and for some reason they didn 't want me to come , or it was hard to find a time and a place , and it took a while , but finally they said , " okay , you can come .
so i said , " yes , a ' reverse fishing license . ' " so we walked away from this dinner really not knowing where to go at that point .
the ocean heated up as it does sometimes , and the hot spot formed and stalled right over the phoenix islands for six months .
so the conditions for success here are listed .
it 's essentially a way to make a national oral histories archive one conversation at a time .
so we 're a media design firm , and we 're working with a broad array of different institutions building media installations for museums and public spaces .
so we started in 2006 as part of a team with thinc design to create the original master plan for the museum , and then we 've done all the media design both for the museum and the memorial and then the media production .
voice 1 : i was in honolulu , hawaii . voice 2 : i was in cairo , egypt .
and as you leave that storytelling moment understanding about 9 / 11 , we then turn the museum back into a moment of listening and actually talk to the individual visitors and ask them their own experiences about 9 / 11 .
you can see the relationships between the different names themselves .
you 'll have unsurpassed vitality and energy .
it was a rare gem -- a brain tumor , hemangioblastoma -- the gift that keeps on giving .
in the words of president obama , " if the taliban take over again , they will invite back al-qaeda , who will try to kill as many of our people as they possibly can . "
but in those early days when we 're told we didn 't have enough troops and enough resources , we made a lot of progress in afghanistan .
and mullah mustafa -- he 's the man with the pen and paper -- explained that the man sitting immediately to the left as you look at the photograph , nadir shah had bet him that he couldn 't hit me .
or in 2007 , the norwegian deputy foreign minister , espen eide , to say that that would deliver the " decisive year . "
diplomats are locked in embassy compounds .
the crime rates in bosnia today are lower than they are in sweden .
when you 're doing mountain rescue , you don 't take a doctorate in mountain rescue , you look for somebody who knows the terrain .
we imagine there are only two choices : either full engagement and troop deployment or total isolation .
and so we try to ask : what kind of school would have the teenagers fighting to get in , not fighting to stay out ?
that 's grown this year to about 10 .
i 'm interested in how many are three to 12 years old .
a long time ago , back in the early 1900s , museums were out looking for dinosaurs .
everybody likes to have their own animal that they named .
and that 's by actually cutting into their bones .
they say , " go away . "
it 's unclear to me how they actually sorted these three of them out .
so a colleague of mine at berkley , he and i were looking at triceratops .
and this is a skull that is two meters long .
so we look at the bone histology .
and that 's a good number .
so here 's what they found on monday : imagine you take a bell , and you whack the bell with a hammer .
thanks a lot .
so the next step for us in this process is now to find a way to let all of you build things like this , and so the way that we 're approaching that is by teaching workshops to people where we explain how they can use these kinds of tools , and then also working to get the tools and the materials and techniques out into the real world in a variety of ways .
check out this image above the orange line in boston .
the bees like it in the city .
it 's 1968 , and we 're pretty much covering asia .
why don 't we think about honeybees in that same type of way ?
i mean , locally in boston , there is a terrific company called green city growers , and they are going and pollinating their squash crops by hand with q-tips , and if they miss that three day window , there 's no fruit .
they survive because medieval scribes copied them and copied them and copied them .
they weren 't in a and b at all ; they were completely new texts by archimedes , and they were called " the method " and " the stomachion . "
and this is the sort of thing that we had to deal with : there was glue on the spine of the book .
but none of them worked .
and that electron disappears .
well one of the unique texts in archimedes is called " the stomachion . "
consider the spartans .
because institutions at the moment confine their data with copyright restrictions and that sort of thing .
now , there is no need for these restrictions at all .
we will venture into outer space , and we will start inhabiting outer space .
and that 's another crucial part of the project .
these people have been living there for a very long time and can be considered experts in sustainability , and so i 'm very interested to see what we can learn from them , and have an input of indigenous knowledge into space exploration .
what about a society today ?
so , some societies , for subtle environmental reasons , are more fragile than others . and then finally , another generalization . i 'm now teaching a course at ucla , to ucla undergraduates , on these collapses of societies . what really bugs my ucla undergraduate students is , how on earth did these societies not see what they were doing ?
and the outcome is going to get resolved within a few decades .
it 's a mystery .
speaking of dinosaurs , sharks are basically the same fish they were 300 million years ago .
or take this sea cucumber .
my characters are -- my lead character 's a shark named sherman .
and that was a lot of fun because , as most of you know , it 's a real project we 've heard about .
so a lot of people remember the plastic bottle anyway , but we really talked about marine debris and plastic in the course of that one .
it becomes a near-death experience for sherman .
and you hear other people doing the same thing .
humanity is now fully into the techno-scientific age .
therefore you will do well to act on the side , no matter how far into the laboratory you may go , to serve as teachers during the span of your career .
they are instead the products of downstream imagination leading to hard work , during which mathematical reasoning may or may not prove to be relevant .
make a fray of your own .
find out what they are .
there was a time when i considered wild soundscapes to be a worthless artifact .
and here 's lincoln meadow before selective logging .
this is a spectrogram of what the frog chorusing looks like when it 's in a very healthy pattern .
and while a picture may be worth 1,000 words , a soundscape is worth 1,000 pictures .
and of course , the object had to be very grand and have a sense of ritualism , the way my uncle likes it .
of course , it got much better after that .
so this work is a caricature of an upside-down man .
and the idea was that at some point you would stop looking at the form of a teddy bear and you would almost perceive it to be a hole in the space , and as if you were looking out into the twinkling night sky .
everybody gets involved . it 's just a matter of when the inevitable happens .
ten percent 's come from india .
if you look at the red line here , what you 're going to see is that in 1975 , just nine percent of kids were in secondary school education in sub-saharan africa .
and what you 've got is a reinforcing positive circle going on .
i 've been arrested because i refused to pay a bribe -- not in africa , actually .
if that 's familiar , that 's exactly what happened in sub-sahara in the ' 80s and the ' 90s .
you can go and download some of the great african literature from the internet now .
and so we 're going to have to do a lot of work that goes beyond just the internet .
or " who does that ? " and the answer is : anybody who wants to pitch in .
it started out with an article in red herring .
it 's a social concept of cooperation , so we don 't talk a lot about truth and objectivity .
so we do have edits by anonymous users , which is one of the most controversial and intriguing things about wikipedia .
the example i 've got up here is a votes for deletion page .
like i say , it 's a tight knit community .
it just isn 't appropriate .
have you found wikipedia being used by teachers , and how do you see wikipedia changing education ?
he said , " it 's tough to make predictions , especially about the future . "
the second reason that the new machine age is such great news is that , once the androids start doing jobs , we don 't have to do them anymore , and we get freed up from drudgery and toil .
if we look at the returns to labor , in other words total wages paid out in the economy , we see them at an all-time low and heading very quickly in the opposite direction .
for example , in 1960 they were both very likely to have full-time jobs , working at least 40 hours a week .
and if you find yourself worried that something like a guaranteed income is going to stifle our drive to succeed and make us kind of complacent , you might be interested to know that social mobility , one of the things we really pride ourselves on in the united states , is now lower than it is in the northern european countries that have these very generous social safety nets .
and my biggest worry is that we 're creating a world where we 're going to have glittering technologies embedded in kind of a shabby society and supported by an economy that generates inequality instead of opportunity .
but what they do have is incredible social skills .
and the fact is , people learn from people they love .
driving them home , and they want them to be enlightened , so they take them to ben & amp ; jerry 's ice cream company with its own foreign policy .
and when you synthesize it all , it 's giving us a new view of human nature .
and the brain scans were identical in both activities .
and so let me list just a couple of the things i think this research points us toward trying to understand .
nineteen percent of americans are in the top one percent of earners .
but in fact , it 's phenomenally complicated to take a concept " i " and a concept " tiger " and blend them together .
through the policy failures of the last 30 years , we have come to acknowledge , i think , how shallow our view of human nature has been .
but the one thing i want you to notice about them is this : even though this is a very long list , there isn 't a single thing on it that involves other human beings .
wisdom depends on experience , and not just any experience .
and the kid was drinking it , and a security guard spotted it , and called the police , who called an ambulance that rushed to the ballpark , whisked the kid to the hospital .
we can certainly see this in response to the current financial crisis .
scripts like these are insurance policies against disaster .
they knew it was dangerous .
so what can we do ?
two were particularly inspiring to me .
even the wisest and most well-meaning people will give up if they have to swim against the current in the organizations in which they work .
obama appealed to virtue .
and the size of these bubbles , the size of the bubbles here , that shows how many are infected in each country , and the color is the continent .

and i 'm hopeful because it 's not only philanthropy that 's reorganizing itself , it 's also whole other portions of the social sector , and of business , that are busy challenging " business as usual . "
this is a newspaper publisher and a banker .
every time you get some security , you 're always trading off something .
that rabbit will make a security trade-off : " should i stay , or should i flee ? "
this is for children .
one mango , two mangoes , three mangoes , 10,000 mangoes , 100,000 mangoes -- it 's still more mangoes you can eat before they rot .
enough real world examples helps .
in a primitive and simple world , there 's really no reason for a model because feeling is close to reality .
models can come from the media , from our elected officials .
intuitive is just another word for familiar .
and i call that their agenda .
we can do to the next harvest .
and that 's okay .
this terrified people .
what 's important is that they be about the same .
so i closed my eyes , i took breath and the first thing that came up and out was " summertime , " porgy and bess .
to me , this piece is an ode to the voice because it 's mysterious -- as we can see -- it 's quite spontaneous , and it 's primal .
but fortunately there is a finite size that you can see , and that 's known as the schwarzschild radius .
i only need two things .
now , there are a few relatively exotic galaxies .
and what we see is a line of stars .
now , this is wonderful , because the campaign promise of large telescopes is that is that the bigger the telescope , the smaller the detail that we can see .
and over the course of this experiment , these stars have moved a tremendous amount .
i have told you my job is to get it down to the schwarzchild radius .
so , you shouldn 't see young stars .
so , we think the future of this experiment is quite exciting .
but , of course , god got a lot of help .
we should study them with the same intensity that we study all the other important natural phenomena , like global warming , as we heard so eloquently last night from al gore .
it 's like a coin flip ; it doesn 't count really .
i don 't think that 's defensible , but i 'd really be pleased to get your answers on that -- any reactions to that -- later .
they were clueless .
the lesson we learn from this is you don 't have to have a mind to be a beneficiary .
we now wield the paintbrush . "
true story .
you 've just heard the man .
you 've just heard the man .
now some of this is a difference of opinion , and that 's not my main complaint .
is he endorsing creationism here ? "
well , this from " the purpose driven life " -- " the bible must become the authoritative standard for my life , the compass i rely on for direction , the counsel i listen to for making wise decisions and the benchmark i use for evaluating everything . "
here 's one , not as beautiful as the others .
and if we could figure that out , how can we implement those designs ?
they all produce the pattern of a pogo stick . how is that true ?
whereas nature tends to be small , and curved , and it bends and twists , and has legs instead , and appendages , and has many muscles and many , many sensors .
now , what good are springy legs then ? what can they do ?
nothing can do that . and i talk next . i showed them this video with the simple design of rhex here . and just to convince them we should go to mars in 2011 , i tinted the video orange just to give them the sense of being on mars .
if you have a son or a daughter that wants to come to berkeley , come to my lab and we 'll figure this out . okay , send them to berkeley because that 's the next thing i want to do . here 's the gecko mill .
think of the contact of that that 's possible .
but the ants do , and we 'll figure out why , so that ultimately we 'll make this move . and imagine : you 're going to be able to have swarms of these six-millimeter robots available to run around .
i basically decided that it was i , not the camera or the network , or anything that lay outside myself , that was the only instrument in storytelling truly worth tuning .
but what i saw opened my eyes to an idea of forgiveness which i never thought possible .
this man was very drunk , and he was very interested in my camera , until he noticed the women , who handled him with smiles , and ak-47s at the ready , of course .
some of the local people forcibly took away the hoses from the firemen to put out the fire in their homes .
and that 's the power of storytelling .
you 'll notice that it looks pretty much like the iconic yellow ball -- that sun that we all draw when we 're children .
i was born in a little village called gando .
fundraising was not an easy task .
in this school , there was a simple idea : to create comfort in a classroom .
something we have in gando are clay pots .
it brings sand and gravel to the river we need to use to build .
i just asked my mother one day , " why do all these women love me so much ? "
would look at it .
and it was very funny . i used four , five and six years old kids .
they are teaching these kids exactly this principle .
but one of the things that exposed me early to learning , and a tremendous curiosity that was instilled in me as a child , was through a technology which is on the screen -- is a victrola .
although frankly speaking , we don 't believe the internet is the killer app .
and one of the reasons is , in south africa , it costs 100 dollars a month to have a broadband connectivity .
we 're talking about something very similar here .
children dress with very colorful , colorful clothes , and it is incredible to see the power that this has in the hands of kids , in a computer . and i have to tell you that it 's so easy to appreciate the impact that access to technology and connectivity can have in the lives and education of these kids .
i really believe that you have to have a passion for it .
it felt wrong to do that in some way .
now i know there 's been a whole lot of hype about our power to control biology .
it 's going to change the way we have children .
that 's going to have amazing impacts .
and it 's obvious to anyone , that if we can do this , we absolutely will do this , whatever the consequences are .
the birth of a delayed identical twin is not going to shake western civilization .
the first is that all these technologies are just a spin-off of mainstream medical research that everybody wants to see happen .
some people are going to see this as an abomination , as the worst thing , as just awful .
and i don 't think that 's what 's going to happen .
i think that our choice in the choice of life , is not whether we 're going to go down this path .
what 's the evidence of wiping out ?
arousal addiction , you want different .
my dad has alzheimer 's disease .
based on what i 've learned from taking care of my father , and researching what it 's like to live with dementia , i 'm focusing on three things in my preparation : i 'm changing what i do for fun , i 'm working to build my physical strength , and -- this is the hard one -- i 'm trying to become a better person .
i want to be as happy as i can for as long as i can .
first , i don 't have a mobile , so i 'm on the safe side .
so the government decided to have the elections once again .
it was the human rights moment .
and you have the market revolution of the 1980s and the huge increase of inequality in societies .
and you have this very strongly to the extent that , even if you see when we talk about revolutions these days , these revolutions are not named anymore around ideologies or ideas .
it 's not going to be the big brother watching you , it 's going to be we being the big brother watching the political class .
a little over 20 years ago i did something that i regret , something that i 'm not particularly proud of , something that , in many ways , i wish no one would ever know , but here i feel kind of obliged to reveal .
now many people begin trying to thumbtack the candle to the wall .
three and a half minutes longer . now this makes no sense right ?
let me show you what i mean .
so what really matters are the more right-brained creative , conceptual kinds of abilities .
okay ? if you do really well you get the large reward , on down .
here 's what the economists there said : " we find that financial incentives can result in a negative impact on overall performance . "
traditional notions of management are great if you want compliance .
okay ? radical amounts of autonomy .
do it because you like to do it .
we do not invest in victims , we invest in survivors .
and she said business was even more important for women because earning an income earned respect and money was power for women .
and when this story posted , i ran to my computer to send it to the imf official .
and as the world bank recently noted , women are stuck in a productivity trap .
so the great news is this is an incredible opportunity .
" you will find a job . take the leap . "
well , it 's been around for 2,500 years .
and there it is kind of grown , at least one particular section of it .
i mean , you — i 'm just like , a hush , huh -- it 's like -- it 's beethoven , how can you say that ?
so in that regard , this is one of the things , this is one of the privileges of being , and here 's another role , the inventor , and by the way , when i told you that i 'm the world 's greatest , if you 're keeping score , we 've had narcissism and solipsism and now a healthy dose of egocentricism .
so one of the things is that , i mean , some people would say , like , " oh , you 're being a dilettante , " and maybe that 's true . i can understand how , i mean , because i don 't have a pedigree in visual art and i don 't have any training , but it 's just something that i wanted to do as an extension of my composition , as an extension of a kind of creative impulse .
this is " tlön , " for three conductors and no players .
is it music ? here 's how i want to conclude .
and these 20 old men who i 'd seen before all of a sudden stood up in these full warrior costumes with the headdress and the spears , and no one was in the square , and i was hidden in the shadows .
an ideograph is like a brush painting , a japanese brush painting .
but the beauty of it is that it 's just silk and sticks .
ferdinand : beyond all limit .
what , if i were to boil it down , would be the one image that i could hang my hat on for this ?
jt : if i give enough movement in the sculpture , and the actor moves their head , you feel like it 's alive .
so i throw away my camera . i throw away my thongs , and i looked at the line straight in front of me , and i got down on all fours like a cat , and i held with my knees to either side of this line in front of me , for 30 yards or 30 feet , i don 't know .
it just takes a little bit more .
but then , they were very surprised when i graduated from high school .
we wanted those freedoms .
but it 's taken all stakeholders , working together -- teachers and principals on one-year contracts , working over and above and beyond their contract hours without compensation .
and for three to four years , i went to university .
it has also some beautiful primates .
they were killing people . they were doing whatever they want because they have power .
and with soldiers , they went to the forest for poaching elephants .
with friends , we had been sitting and watching match football , and having some good music with worldspace radio , when it started , i think .
we started talking with them and i was negotiating .
i said , " i have never seen it .
the elephant just decayed and they just got the tusks .
i think we see the war like a game -- like soccer , football .
many are dying because of all those kind of pandemics , hiv , malaria , poverty , not going to school .
and i noticed this in a very funny way .
and there are two important messages , or two lessons , to take from that reality .
now these are things about general culture , but i 'm also very much interested in political culture and whether liberty and democracy is appreciated , or whether there 's an authoritarian political culture in which the state is supposed to impose things on the citizens .
but one thing was curious : most of those problems turn out to be problems that emerged later , not from the very divine core of islam , the koran , but from , again , traditions and mentalities , or the interpretations of the koran that muslims made in the middle ages .
and that 's why the ottoman empire in its last decades turned into a proto-democracy , a constitutional monarchy , and freedom was a very important political value at the time .
and when the colonial period ended , what you had in place of that was , generally , secular dictators , which say they 're a country , but did not bring democracy to the country , and established their own dictatorship .
but the pro-e.u. sentiment in turkey in the past decade has become almost an islamic cause and supported by the islamic liberals and the secular liberals as well , of course .
and you could look at this art and you could , of course , see the complex social organization of the people who brought it into being .
there is no progression of affairs in human experience .
their billboards are manuals , prayers to the well-being of all sentient creatures .
you start off at 11,500 feet .
take a direct north-south bearing , you find to your astonishment that it bisects the intiwatana stone , goes to the skyline , hits the heart of salcantay , the second of the most important mountains of the incan empire .
they say , " upon this loom , i weave my life . "
this little boy will never step outside of the sacred fields that surround the men 's hut for all that time , until he begins his journey of initiation .
and what struck me so extraordinary was to be again with the inuit -- a people who don 't fear the cold , but take advantage of it .
right now , as we sit here in this room , of those 6,000 languages spoken the day that you were born , fully half aren 't being taught to children .
when romo wakes up , he 's in creature mode .
so i 'll snap a picture .
but i just want to finish by talking about something that we 're working on in the future .
neither am i a veteran social worker .
so , we started parikrma .
the vocabulary used in those books and the style of writing .
it 's very interesting . when we started our school the parents would give thumbprints in the attendance register .
girl : duke iima camp . whenever we see that iima , it was such a pride for us to go to that camp .
there is an inter-school athletic competition that is held every year in bangalore , where 5,000 children participate from 140 best schools in the city .
he has learned how to speak english .
she said , " what leads to success ? "
physically , mentally , you 've gotta push , push , push . "
thank you tedsters for all your interviews !
so , i have a kind of a simple story , and it suggests that what we want to think about is this thing that we 're making , this thing that has happened in 5,000 days -- that 's all these computers , all these handhelds , all these cell phones , all these laptops , all these servers -- basically what we 're getting out of all these connections is we 're getting one machine .
and the total traffic on this is running at seven terabytes per second .
we think they 're all separate devices , but in fact , every screen in the world is looking into the one machine .
and so every thing will be part of the web .
and i 'm saying , " humans are now going to be the extended senses of the machine , " in a certain sense .
we 're now entering to the third stage , which is what i 'm talking about , and that is where we link the data .
so that 's what you want , is all your friends are identified , and you should just carry these relationships around .
google . i can 't remember my phone number , i 'll just ask google .
and all these devices will be portals into that .
and that 's me with youssou n 'dour , onstage , having the time of my life .
they work in the field .
and in this way , i 've been strengthening my platform and broadening my outreach .
five months later , we went back to south africa to meet avelile again .
but this polyp would continue and tell us that his neighbors were quite clearly identical copies of him .
the rest of physics is about describing what can happen and what can 't .
all of these matter particles come in left- and right-handed varieties , and have anti-particle partners that carry opposite charges .
so when two up quarks and a down quark are combined to make a proton , it has a total electric charge of plus one .
so these patterns of charges are not just pretty .
when we introduce a new direction , we get to guess what charges the particles have along this direction , and then we can rotate it in with the others .
the pattern of this shape living in eight-dimensional charge space is exquisitely beautiful , and it summarizes thousands of possible interactions between these elementary particles , each of which is just a facet of this complicated shape .
if the lhc finds new particles , but they don 't fit this pattern -- well , that will be very interesting , but bad for this e8 theory .
and this is another , and another .
but a string theorist , as i understand it , explains electrons in terms of much smaller strings vibrating -- i know you don 't like string theory -- vibrating inside it .
now as you ponder that question , maybe you 're thinking about the first day of preschool or kindergarten , the first time that kids are in a classroom with a teacher .
but the pregnant woman 's own voice reverberates through her body , reaching the fetus much more readily .
the flavors of the food a pregnant woman eats find their way into the amniotic fluid , which is continuously swallowed by the fetus .
will it be born into a world of abundance or scarcity ?
why would undernutrition in the womb result in disease later ?
when the planes struck and the towers collapsed , many of these women experienced the same horrors inflicted on other survivors of the disaster -- the overwhelming chaos and confusion , the rolling clouds of potentially toxic dust and debris , the heart-pounding fear for their lives .
sousa was not a fan of the talking machines .
as lord blackstone described it , land is protected by trespass law , for most of the history of trespass law , by presuming it protects the land all the way down below and to an indefinite extent upward .
and the important point to recognize is that even though these broadcasters were broadcasting something you would call second best , that competition was enough to break , at that time , this legal cartel over access to music .
and i ....
you 're a trespasser with about as much sense as these people were trespassers .
but let me end with something i think much more important -- much more important than business .
the " blank slate " was an influential idea in the 20th century .
now , these aren 't just differences in anatomy , like the shape of your ear lobes , but they have consequences in thought and behavior that are well illustrated in this famous cartoon by charles addams : " separated at birth , the mallifert twins meet accidentally . "
so even if people did have impulses towards selfishness or greed , that 's not the only thing in the skull , and there are other parts of the mind that can counteract them .
so let me tell you what aroused such irate responses , and i 'll let you decide if whether they -- the claims are really that outrageous .
and the humanities and arts programs in the universities , which by many measures , indeed are in decline .
people are staying away from elite art and criticism .
you might think , well , then they 'd be even more similar , because not only would they share their genes , but they would also share their environment .
and he said that the explosion was so loud and the light was so intense , that he actually had to put his hands in front of his face to protect his eyes .
and i wanted to really shake the lapels of world leaders to get them to understand what is happening .
i had to taste the salt water in my mouth .
and so what had actually happened is that the cells in my fingers had frozen and expanded .
at the very best , i 'm going to end up losing some fingers .
and i said to myself , " lewis , don 't look left , don 't look right .
against the current ! you did it against the current !
now is the time to believe .
" we have lasers ; we can whiten it out . "
there was one person in the group that was supposed to have very high performance that was actually performing terribly .
when i was doing these experiments , in my mind , i was helping science .
we made it learn from us , and we set it free in the desert .
do you realize that you , ted users , spend an average of 52 minutes per day in traffic , wasting your time on your daily commute ?
and then , because you felt that satisfaction , you 're less motivated to do the actual hard work necessary .
and you can see we have sputnik , and we have saturn , and we have other manifestations of space exploration .
all the things we 're going to walk through in our explorations and discoveries of the oceans were mostly discoveries made by accident .
why ? ok . now , i began my explorations the hard way .
we went down into the rift valley .
we punched a bunch of heat probes . everything made sense , except , at the axis , there was missing heat . it was missing heat .
and when we cut them open , they didn 't have the anatomy of a clam .
we went in underneath and tapped it , and we found that it had the ph of drano .
it said yorktown on the stern .
and i was looking at it yesterday , it 's up in seattle . ok .
she 's talking to the pilot . she 's 5,000 miles away , but she 's assumed command .
and my final question , my final question -- why are we not looking at moving out onto the sea ?
it disturbed me so much that i decided that i was going to give up riding and driving in motorized vehicles .
and so i did .
i had a newspaper clipping .
so i did that .
" no , i think he 's talking about selective forestry . "
because it 's sort of like that tree in the forest falling ; and if there 's no one there to hear , does it really make a sound ?
and you know , i forgot the most important thing , which is why i started talking , which i have to tell you .
" what was that about , " i 'm saying . what was that about ?
we have to change now .
on the other hand , statistics -- that 's a subject that you could , and should , use on daily basis . right ?
he runs a little shop in one of the back streets of mumbai .
it 's this entire ecosystem of low-cost parts and supplies that are produced all over the world , literally , and then redistributed to basically service this industry , and you can even buy salvaged parts .
can we make a little product or a service out of it ? "
we dismantle the whole thing , we reassemble it in a new configuration , and we do this hardware mashup , systematically training the guy how to do this .
so we said , " what can we do with the asha worker that 'll allow this asha worker to become an interesting filter , but not just a filter , a really well thought through referral system that allows load balancing of the network , and directs patients to different sources of health care based on the severity or the criticalness of those situations ? "
oh bruno , you can go home , actually .
we are very happy to have the possibility to be with you in the other side of the world .
well , i have to admit , actually , that i also had a very selfish reason for building mathematica : i wanted to use it myself , a bit like galileo got to use his telescope 400 years ago .
so here it is .
so , it 's been a big , very complex project , which i was not sure was going to work at all .
so let 's type that in , and now wolfram alpha will go and use available public health data and try and figure out what part of the population that corresponds to and so on .
so , i 'm pretty pleased with it all .
you can also just sort of give vague input and then try and have wolfram alpha figure out what you 're talking about .
in a sense , we can use the computational universe to get mass customized creativity .
one 's got to build a lot of technology .
does your work relate to his ?
but here 's what really perplexed me .
he was suffering from brain seizures that were impossible to see with the naked eye , but that were actually causing symptoms that mimicked those of autism .
it doesn 't matter whether you live in a small african village , or you live in a big city , everything comes back to plants in the end : whether it 's for the food , the medicine , the fuel , the construction , the clothing , all the obvious things ; or whether it 's for the spiritual and recreational things that matter to us so much ; or whether it 's soil formation , or the effect on the atmosphere , or primary production .
this is a nuclear-proof facility .
so every 10 years we do germination tests on every sample of seeds that we have .
we have training going on in china , in the usa , and many other countries .
you walk there , and it hurts .
but the americans ? oh , we 'll make some guns for lego , no problem .
the insides were lego .
but i had been commuting for two years between washington and princeton , new jersey , where my husband and my two teenage sons lived , and it was not going well .
and breadwinners who are also caregivers have a much wider range of experiences and contacts .
but consider a same-sex couple like my friends sarah and emily .
so changing our workplaces and building infrastructures of care would make a big difference , but we 're not going to get equally valued choices unless we change our culture , and the kind of cultural change required means re-socializing men .
they take paternity leave when they can .
it will happen .
dn design , nature , art . these are the three things that condition my world .
it is more valuable than the product in my eyes . i don 't have one .
when i look at these things , they look pretty normal to me .
not a bad idea . i don 't know . i need to talk to janine and a few other people about that , but i believe instinctively that that meringue can become something , a car -- i don 't know .
i don 't -- and they look funky too -- but i don 't set out to make funky things because i think that 's an absolute disgrace .
coral , all these natural forces , take away what they don 't need and they deliver maximum beauty .
so i try to create this energy of invention every day in my studio .
they laughed everywhere over the world i showed this .
and that 's what i do with my furniture .
who cares ?
i 'm a contaminator for all those children of investment bankers -- wankers .
a copper jelly mold .
given that it was such a vast civilization , you might expect to find really powerful rulers , kings , and huge monuments glorifying these powerful kings .
perhaps that big ?
these people believe that the indus script represents an ancient form of the dravidian language family , which is the language family spoken in much of south india today .
and i 'd like to describe some of the results that we have found .
now there 's several thoughts . there 's e. it could be i. it could be a , but certainly not b , c or d , right ?
here 's an example of a symbol that was predicted .
when this result was first published , it was highly controversial .
and why were they found there ?
in the case of the indus script , the problem is the reverse .
the decipherment of these two scripts enabled these civilizations to speak to us again directly .
and the minute we found this leopard , we realized that we needed to move in , and so we basically stayed with this leopard for the next four-and-a-half years -- following her every day , getting to know her , that individual personality of hers , and really coming to know her .
but also , our hearts are in our throats a huge amount of the time , because we 're driving through water , and it 's an unknown territory .
he 's focused on this hyena , and he is going to get it .
and for us , in many ways , this elephant has become a symbol of inspiration for us , a symbol of that hope as we go forward in our work .
but only when we saw the tiny baby baboon clinging to the mother 's fur did we realize that something very unique was taking place here with legadema .
bj : and then cheetahs have crashed all the way down to 12,000 .
dj : so what our investigations have shown is that these lions are essential .
when i tried my first trick , it looked like this .
as a result of these efforts , and the help of many others , it happened .
you are all smelling pretty much the same thing , ok ?
enzymes that chew things up , antibodies , it 's all , you know , the fit between a protein and whatever it is grabbing , in this case a smell .
a theory is something that enables you to do less work .
so i went searching when i started in this game to convince myself that there was any degree of plausibility to this whole crazy story .
so it 's a joke against myself .
now , coumarin is a very common thing , a material , in fragrance which is derived from a bean that comes from south america .
and people often ask me , is your theory accepted ?
or maybe it was 31 and a quarter percent .
you know you have 46 chromosomes . if you 're lucky , you 've got 23 from each parent . sometimes you get an extra one or drop one out , but -- so you can skip the grandparent and great-grandparent stage and go right to the great-great-grandparent . and you have 46 people and you give them a scanner , or whatever you need , and they look at their chromosomes and each of them says which one he likes best , or she -- no reason to have just two sexes any more , even . so each child has 46 parents , and i suppose you could let each group of 46 parents have 15 children .
and nobody knows how hard that is , but we 'll probably find out in a few years .
you know , there 's about 400 different parts of the brain which seem to have different functions .
so nuclear fusion is our energy future .
instead of requiring multi-million-dollar facilities i 've developed a device that , on a very small scale , can produce these isotopes .
but then , got off on a vacation trip , and was studying bird flight , just for the fun of it , and you can watch a bird soaring around in circles , and measure the time , and estimate the bank angle , and immediately , figure out its speed , and the turning radius , and so on , which i could do in the car , as we 're driving along on a vacation trip -- -- with my three sons , young sons , helping me , but ridiculing the whole thing very much .
but this last time , just coming round , right now , suddenly , there 'd be huge changes in the environment , in the concentration of people , and it was just unbelievable , the amount of -- all the change in it .
let 's have the next slide .
approaching a peak radar altitude of 96,863 feet , at 4 : 12 p.m. , helios is standing on top of 98 percent of the earth 's atmosphere .
i 've never seen anything like that .
all right .
it 's certainly a very important medium for input , and a lot of people think that fingers are a very low-resolution sort of stylus for inputting to a display .
and when you touch it with your finger , you can actually , then , introduce all the forces on the face of that screen , and that actually has a certain amount of value .
here , the idea is that you 're going to take this book , if you will , and it 's going to come alive .
you try and think of a different way of saying the same thing , or if you know the particular student and that student 's cognitive style , then you might say it in a way that you think would have a good impedance match with that student .
nn : i suspect that some of you might not even understand that language .
and it really meant something to the child .
i will come to my last example and then quit .
how many of you found it really , really annoying ?
so this project started from the following realization : it turns out that approximately 200 million captchas are typed everyday by people around the world .
basically the way this works is you start with an old book .
and basically , since we released it about three or four years ago , a lot of websites have started switching from the old captcha where people wasted their time to the new captcha where people are helping to digitize books .
see here 's the thing , since we 're presenting two randomly chosen words , interesting things can happen .
but now with the internet , i 've just shown you a project where we 've gotten 750 million people to help us digitize human knowledge .
so i would like to translate all of the web , or at least most of the web , into every major language .
and then comes the ending , which is my favorite part of the whole thing .
normally , you have to pay people to do this .
first of all , people are really , really learning a language .
remember , this is 50 million dollars-worth of value .
so thank you .
it extends from the subatomic scale to the farthest reaches of the cosmos .
now , fish like to stay close together , about a body length apart .
it 's beautiful . the birds are , we sort of understand , we think , from that computer model , what 's going on .
on , more on and then off .
if you look , for instance , at how lasers work , that would be a case of atomic synchrony .
how can metronomes communicate ?
now , everyone was very excited to try it out .
and then show me what it was like when the bridge started to go . right .
interviewer : you didn 't expect . engineer : exactly .
so already , the simulator is making me walk in exactly the same way as our witnesses walked on the real bridge .
i realized that success is a moment , but what we 're always celebrating is creativity and mastery .
it 's not the same as success , which i see as an event , a moment in time , and a label that the world confers upon you .
the paris review got it out of james baldwin when they asked him , " what do you think increases with knowledge ? "
now it occurred to me , as i thought about this , why the archery coach told me at the end of that practice , out of earshot of his archers , that he and his colleagues never feel they can do enough for their team , never feel there are enough visualization techniques and posture drills to help them overcome those constant near wins .
and they spend their daytime resting and socializing in the safety of the shallows , but at night , they go off the edge and hunt in deep water .
and they have touch .
and basically , one of these groups will kind of back off and everything will resolve fine , and it doesn 't really escalate into violence too much .
this underwater keyboard in orlando , florida , at the epcot center , was actually the most sophisticated ever two-way interface designed for humans and dolphins to work together under the water and exchange information .
and i spent four years with my colleagues adam pack and fabienne delfour , working out in the field with this keyboard using it with each other to do requests for toys while the dolphins were watching .
so i 'm reaching over . she 's got the scarf on her right side .
well , chat is designed specifically to empower the dolphins to request things from us .
sorry , this was my mother , by the way , in her bead shop in london .
so it 's got hybrid drive .
but recently , any annual report of a power company doesn 't have a power station on it .
and it 's a power park .
i 've never met anyone who says , " i don 't like flowers . "
and to make the project affordable , we focused our energy .
th : i 'm sorry about my stupid voice there .
since we have an extra minute here , i thought perhaps you could tell us a little bit about these seeds , which maybe came from the shaved bit of the building .
and as you 're thinking of the consequences of that , it 's getting really hard to hide from this stuff , among other things , because it 's not just the electronic tattoos , it 's facial recognition that 's getting really good .
with all this data out here , it might be a good idea not to look too far into the past of those you love .
i mean , it 's quite brutal .
and at ted here in february , their passion and brilliance just took our breath away .
it 's based on hundreds of hours of research , of practice .
it 's the crowd that shines the light and fuels the desire , but the light and desire are a lethal one-two combination that attract new people to the crowd .
i mean , it 's really not news for me to tell you that innovation emerges out of groups .
here , let me introduce you to sam haber .
all those ideas are already out there in print .
so , that primal medium , which your brain is exquisitely wired for ...
schools can 't be silos .
they turned a trash place into a garden .
he was raised by very supportive and interested parents .
now , one of the wonderful things that nasa does is it puts up a variety of satellites that detect all sort of interesting things about our environment .
so , living at the equator , we got lots and lots of ultraviolet radiation and the melanin -- this wonderful , complex , ancient polymer compound in our skin -- served as a superb natural sunscreen .
there was natural selection for the evolution of lightly pigmented skin .
epidemiologists and doctors have been very good about telling us about protecting our skin .
when people ask you , " what is the evidence for evolution ? "
they only learn to be frightened of those differences when an adult influences them to behave that way , and maybe censors that natural curiosity , or you know , reins in the question-asking in the hopes of them being polite little kids .
at the time , the legs i presented were groundbreaking in prosthetics .
so this magazine , through the hands of graphic designer peter saville , went to fashion designer alexander mcqueen , and photographer nick knight , who were also interested in exploring that conversation .
so whimsy matters .
i think that if we want to discover the full potential in our humanity , we need to celebrate those heartbreaking strengths and those glorious disabilities that we all have .
and these trains are smooth , and they 're quiet and they 're efficient .
remember that great scene on the raft , remember what huck did ?
and she said , " well , personally , i still feel like i have to curtsey when i see the president of my university .
" and four months before this happened , four months before myesha died , i thought i could really fix this man . so i had a baby by him -- insane -- thinking that if i gave him his own kid , he would leave mine alone .
" i mean , i 've been keeping a secret for years and years and years , so it just seemed like second hand to me , just to keep on keeping it a secret .
explosion of joy that this verdict had come back this way .
he is the only model for black community ; i don 't care jesse jackson .
and i 've been going to the rodeos with him , and we 've bonded .
determination is , like , you 're going to hang on that bull , even if you 're riding upside down .
and i believe this is going to prove true .
you can see some of the chaos that 's happening in new york with the air traffic controllers having to deal with all those major airports next to each other .
and then you 're going to see people start to gather in the center of the city to celebrate the night before , which happens right here .
and i started collecting sheep .
sheep were the first animal to be raised from mechanically processed byproducts , the first to be selectively bred for production traits , the first animal to be cloned .
so what you see is actually a representation of how well people did what it was they were asked to do .
you 'd be fed a simple audio clip .
so with everybody making so much amazing stuff and actually understanding what it was they were working on , i was really interested in trying to make a collaborative project where people were working together to build something .
collaborator five : as much as is different from frame to frame , it really is personal .
so the last project i want to talk to you about is another collaboration with chris milk .
you see , the battery is the key enabling device here .
the science is that simple .
it 's fitted with solid electrodes and an electrolyte that 's a solution of salt and water .
so to produce current , magnesium loses two electrons to become magnesium ion , which then migrates across the electrolyte , accepts two electrons from the antimony , and then mixes with it to form an alloy .
so this is the evolution of the liquid metal battery .
so here you have it , grid-level storage : silent , emissions-free , no moving parts , remotely controlled , designed to the market price point without subsidy .
and by profession , he 's a psychophysicist .
you know , let 's just make an educated guess , and they simply point and they go for 10 percent , right in the middle .
and he came back to them and he said , " you don 't just need to improve your regular ; you need to create zesty . "
ten small bowls of pasta , with a different spaghetti sauce on each one .
it is , in fact , enormously important . i 'll explain to you why .
what were they obsessed with in the early ' 80s ? they were obsessed with mustard .
there is no perfect mustard or imperfect mustard .
that 's what it was . and why were we attached to that ?
if , however , you allowed me to break you into coffee clusters , maybe three or four coffee clusters , and i could make coffee just for each of those individual clusters , your scores would go from 60 to 75 or 78 .
and it 's working beautifully .
i will make you a bet , and i am confident that i will win the bet .
and by the way , the arts aren 't just important because they improve math scores .
but a wonderful guy he was , wonderful philosopher .
and the third principle is this : that human life is inherently creative .
the thing about work in finland is this : they don 't obsess about those disciplines .
they recognize that you can 't improve education if you don 't pick great people to teach and if you don 't keep giving them constant support and professional development .
there are trends , but the stories are always unique .
and in the spring of 2005 , there was a phenomenon .
the cop says , " are you sure ? hey buddy , are you sure you lost your keys here ? "
sometimes it takes months to even years to do something like this .
sometimes it can take two years to type that information into a computer , and sometimes , actually not infrequently , it actually never happens .
so that 's actually what i began to do .
then you had to find the money to pay for me to fly out to your country and the money to pay for my hotel and my per diem and my daily rate .
they don 't require any programmers .
cloud-based , no training , no consultants , no me .
now , you may remember me asking the question as well , a very interesting observation , that actually those strange little signs that actually flash " 35 " at you , occasionally accompanying a little smiley face or a frown , according to whether you 're within or outside the speed limit -- those are actually more effective at preventing road accidents than speed cameras , which come with the actual threat of real punishment .
nothing unusual about that at all , except that these are actually not the buttons that take you to an individual floor .
it 's those people i 'd quite like to create in the world going forward .
i said , " when people login to their online bank there are lots and lots of things they 'd probably quite like to look at .
unfortunately , the science is probably closer to being climatology in that in many cases , very , very small changes can have disproportionately huge effects , and equally , vast areas of activity , enormous mergers , can actually accomplish absolutely bugger-all .
every corporation should have one , and every government should have a ministry of detail .
bihar represents the challenge of development : abject poverty surrounded by corruption .
and this leads me to the third , and in my view , the most significant shift in development : open governance . governments today are opening up just as citizens are demanding voice and accountability .
these examples give new hope , new possibility to the problems i witnessed in uganda or that my father confronted in bihar .
before i left , i actually asked him if i could get him something .
you know the incident .
so essentially , we can start from an anonymous face , offline or online , and we can use facial recognition to give a name to that anonymous face thanks to social media data .
but in fact , privacy is not about having something negative to hide .
and in principle , that 's a very good thing .
when someone tells you , " people don 't care about privacy , " consider whether the game has been designed and rigged so that they cannot care about privacy , and coming to the realization that these manipulations occur is already halfway through the process of being able to protect yourself .
but in fact , in a few years , organizations will know so much about us , they will be able to infer our desires before we even form them , and perhaps buy products on our behalf before we even know we need them .
i nearly died , was in a coma , stayed at the hospital for two years , and underwent 36 surgeries to be able to walk again .
so did our political problems .
thank you .
but this is tiananmen square .
so dai manju basically finished out middle school .
well , let me ask you this question .
poverty , for instance .
so here is bill of arabia .
she lives in ethiopia .
so of course , when you educate a girl , she tends to get married later on in life , she tends to have kids later on in life , she tends to have fewer kids , and those kids that she does have , she educates them in a more enlightened fashion .
larry summers , when he was chief economist at the world bank , once said that , " it may well be that the highest return on investment in the developing world is in girls ' education . "
so you see how transformative little bits of help can be .
one of those things is contributing to a cause larger than yourself .
well , there do seem to be a few .
well , what does this really look like ?
that 's danny bessette , 23 years later , because this is the year , and it 's also the year where danny got married , where we have , for the first time , the approval by the fda of a drug that precisely targets the defect in cystic fibrosis based upon all this molecular understanding .
and the kids that you see here all volunteered to be part of this , 28 of them , and you can see as soon as the picture comes up that they are in fact a remarkable group of young people all afflicted by this disease , all looking quite similar to each other .
could we , in fact , encourage all the companies that are out there that have drugs in their freezers that are known to be safe in humans but have never actually succeeded in terms of being effective for the treatments they were tried for ?
here you see a picture of a lung on a chip .
i think it 'll be the goal of the poets and the muppets and the surfers and the bankers and all the other people who join this stage and think about what we 're trying to do here and why it matters .
i was introduced to robyn , the swedish pop star , and she was also exploring how technology coexists with raw human emotion .
and no , i 'm not a meter maid , and i 'm not an undertaker .
you 'd totally be surprised .
it actually sounds really hokey to say it standing up here , but when you try to put it in practice , it 's really powerful .
shortly after that i got invited to speak at the convention of the people who make balloon animals .
nathan and his boss saw this , and they could not tolerate it .
we then went to the tv idea , that said if you had a big enough mouthpiece , if you could get on tv enough times , if you could buy enough ads , you could win .
but be careful .
you 've got the disorganized rebels over here .
thousands of people around the country who could give his presentation for him , because he can 't be in 100 or 200 or 500 cities in each night .
they merely decided to lead them .
zappos is the one , the only , the best-there-ever-was place for people who are into shoes to find each other , to talk about their passion , to connect with people who care more about customer service than making a nickel tomorrow .
" what would happen if every time someone bought a pair of these shoes i gave exactly the same pair to someone who doesn 't even own a pair of shoes ? "
they want to be missed .
it records the annual rise and fall of greenhouse gases and temperatures going back before the onset of the last ice ages .
ten times a day , they extract the 10-foot long cylinder of compressed ice crystals that contain the unsullied air and trace chemicals laid down by snow , season after season for thousands of years .
why do we need to study this anymore ?
here , the ice seems a living presence .
and he was walking to the front hall and out the front door just about the same time i hit some ice and met him at the front door with the car -- and almost ended up in the front hall .
i joined ford after college , after some soul searching whether or not this is really the right thing to do .
the problem , put in its simplest terms , is one of mathematics .
but the bigger issue is that global gridlock is going to stifle economic growth and our ability to deliver food and health care , particularly to people that live in city centers .
now shared car services are also springing up around the world , and these efforts , i think , are great .
now i know we can develop the technology that 's going to make this work , but we 've got to be willing to get out there and seek out the solutions -- whether that means vehicle sharing or public transportation or some other way we haven 't even thought of yet ; our overall transportation-mix and infrastructure must support all the future options .
i believe we 're at our best when we 're confronted with big issues .
we decided to give back locally .
we pay the bill at the end of the month , but the people that are really going to pay the bill are our grandchildren .
we had to replace them with recyclable plastic .
there are no sidewalks .
and it 's a kind of microcosm of the globalized world .
we need someone to come and study it .
the heart of school has seven kilometers of bamboo in it .
for those of you who 've been there , fantastic coral reefs , fantastic diving , fantastic snorkeling .
high pressure builds over india .
a few kilometers , maybe , is quite typical .
something like this , these are all this species globe skimmer .
humans can dig holes and make a well .
so , i 've been writing it down for 15 years now .
but they are coming 400 miles across the ocean , against the wind .
and that front in the middle is not vertical , it 's at an angle .
and we 're starting in june . so this is the monsoon rain .
the dragonflies are here now . they 're breeding there .
and this crossing here , of the ocean , is the only truly regular transoceanic crossing of any insect .
they have a little refueling stop in northeastern india .
same height as the dragonflies go .
and with these keys , they may have been able to get inside centcom 's systems , to see and hear everything , and maybe even infect some of them .
this gives a tremendous advantage to the attacker , because the defender doesn 't know who to fight back against .
in may 2009 , general kevin chilton , commander of the u.s. nuclear forces , stated that in the event of cyberattacks against the u.s. , all options would be on the table .
this is a small dolos , and eric merrifield is the most famous inventor you 've never heard of .
this is a picture i took at a place called kitengela , about an hour south of nairobi , and the thing that 's so remarkable about the payment system that 's been pioneered in africa called m-pesa is that it works on phones like this .
really simple , really effective , really life-saving .
[ " you 're welcome " ]
reason can lay out a road map to peace and harmony if the reasoner wants peace and harmony , but it can also lay out a road map to conflict and strife if the reasoner delights in conflict and strife .
rng : so if human nature didn 't change , what invigorated those better angels ?
reason has muscle .
in view of the uncertainty , we must define heretics simply as one with whom we disagree .
sp : those words sound familiar .
sp : still , in every case , it took at least a century for the arguments of these great thinkers to trickle down and infiltrate the population as a whole .
look here -- you have to end poverty , education , gender , child and maternal health , control infections , protect the environment and get the good global links between nations in every aspect from aid to trade .
no -- low-income countries like kenya still don 't have that level of organization .
and i was sad , because we could see this reversal in kenya with an increased child mortality in the 90s .
we have a decent trend .
but even this is not a fair representation of africa , because it 's an average , it 's an average speed of reduction in africa .
my country , sweden : 1800 , we were up there .
let me show you thailand , see what a success story , thailand from the 1960s -- how they went down here and reached almost the same child mortality levels as sweden .
and the size of the bubble is the population .
it 's very good -- " levels and trends in child mortality " -- except this page .
that is , when we get girls in school , we 'll get an impact 15 to 20 years later , which is a secular trend which is very strong .
so case closed , right ?
but they settled .
so what does all this mean ?
and kids could bring in drawings and have the store print a sugar plate for the top of their birthday cake .
now the reason it won 't work is that you can still type 74.125.226.212 into the browser or you can make it a clickable link and you 'll still go to google .
and that law was called the audio home recording act of 1992 .
the dmca marks the moment when the media industries gave up on the legal system of distinguishing between legal and illegal copying and simply tried to prevent copying through technical means .
imagine this sign everywhere -- except imagine it doesn 't say college bakery , imagine it says youtube and facebook and twitter .
" we 'd prefer not to do that , " says the content industries .
and what i 'd like to do is take you up to the canopy , not by putting all of you into ropes and harnesses , but rather showing you a very short clip from a national geographic film called " heroes of the high frontier . "
these are not epiphyte roots : these are roots that emerge from the trunk and branch of the host trees themselves .
here in 2009 , you know , it 's not an easy thing to be a forest ecologist , gripping ourselves with these kinds of questions and trying to figure out how we can answer them .
we 've had dance people up in the canopy .
what can i , as an ecologist , do about that ?
i 'm trying to help researchers move more outward to have their own partnerships with people outside of the academic community .
this is a picture of president barack obama and his advisors tracking the killing of osama bin laden .
now , here 's a secret you probably know already : your stories are constructed .
stories in the news are more than twice as likely to present women as victims than men , and women are more likely to be defined by their body parts .
this is its cover from november 15 , 2010 .
it 's important to keep talking about this in light of lara logan .
so i had a client who came in , about to be evicted because he hasn 't paid his rent .
i have 13 minutes with each patient .
so i have spent hours upon hours trying to make sense of this weird groundhog day .
so just a few miles from here at children 's national medical center , when patients come into the doctor 's office , they 're asked a few questions .
they sit , they watch the goldfish in the fish tank , they read extremely old copies of good housekeeping magazine .
but we 'll make huge investments in your training and development , and we 'll give you an extraordinary community of peers . "
and i knew i had to tell jeff purcell , my attorney , that i needed to leave .
last year , i created a one-man show .
two months later , six years old , i 'm able to do one , two , three , four , five , six , seven .
but i could not understand .
so i just created the widest tightrope in the world .
manhattan no longer spreads its infinity .
let 's see , such as my street juggling , for example .
it will go perfectly on the day of the walk .
what a genius , what a professional .
inspiration .
would you be able to do that ?
and so , there 's a whole lot of people saying , " i 'd be very surprised if you told me that this came out of the air .
and if you think the tilt is tilting us closer , no , it isn 't .
so , these mental models -- we look for evidence that reinforces our models .
and we collude . we design tests , or at least in britain , so that people pass them . right ?
it 's the greatest mystery confronting human beings : how does this all come about ?
because it 's as though this neuron is adopting the other person 's point of view .
a human being , a child , can just watch its parent kill another polar bear , and skin it and put the skin on its body , fur on the body , and learn it in one step . what the polar bear took 100,000 years to learn , it can learn in five minutes , maybe 10 minutes .
all that 's separating you from him , from the other person , is your skin .
and of course , most of you have had three meals today , and probably will continue to have after this event .
someone says , " how so ? how could this happen ? "
now that is historic . it 's never happened before in history .
do you worry much ?
indeed there is .
thank you very much .
30 percent of our households gave .
then we went to work with the manufacturers of aids medicines , one of whom was cited in the film , and negotiated a whole different change in business strategy , because even at 500 dollars , these drugs were being sold on a high-margin , low-volume , uncertain-payment basis .
and then there are six different categories of things we can do to change the trajectory .
the person , in my view , who has done the best job of this in the health care area , of building a system in a very poor area , is dr. paul farmer , who , many of you know , has worked for now 20 years with his group , partners in health , primarily in haiti where he started , but they 've also worked in russia , in peru and other places around the world .
she and her team of former business people have created a business plan that will enable us to scale this health system up for the whole country .
we now are treating 325 people a month , despite the fact that almost 100 percent of the aids patients are now treated at home .
thank you and god bless you .
and that mind-blowing insight changes the entire game .
and sometimes it gets big enough to become official .
what does that mean ?
it 's like how can you not be inspired by those people -- your own coworkers ?
what a company .
because this good will is unconsciously picked up by other people , and it creates trust , and trust creates a lot of good working relationships .
it 's axiomatic . why not us ?
extractive : taking raw materials from the earth .
renewable energy is 27 percent of our total , going for 100 percent .
and the goodwill of the marketplace is astonishing .
and now the challenge is in execution .
knowing you has changed my thinking .
i really miss that era , you know , where you could go around for a soiree and see a mechanical computer get demonstrated to you .
this monstrosity over here is the cpu , the chip , if you like .
you 're not just going to have that , so , first of all , you had sound . you had a bell , so if anything went wrong — — or the machine needed the attendant to come to it , there was a bell it could ring .
this is a program written in a particular style .
in fact , it was capable of doing everything we do today with computers , only really slowly .
so , give me five years .
so when you think about this problem , what an enormous undertaking . where do you begin ?
often the first time anyone saw what happened to their house was on virtual earth .
so here what we 're trying to do is we bring the picture and project it into the 3-d model space .
this sound colors our first impression of any room ; it can 't be helped .
the next story is called " in praise of the taxpayer . "
you were late for school again this morning .
apricot halves like the ears of cherubim .
there 's the cerebellum ; that 's keeping you upright right now .
and as you can see , they 're very non-uniformly distributed .
and on these chromosomes are roughly 25,000 genes .
it 's a standard template by which we 're going to hang the rest of this data .
then we very carefully melt onto the slide .
now we do this over and over again , this process for any given brain .
so what can scientists learn about this data ?
so if you 're in drug discovery , for example , you can go through an entire listing of what the genome has on offer to find perhaps better drug targets and optimize .
these are things where genes are turned on in an individual cell type .
it chose somali piracy .
i should think they 'll say yes , because they 'll know that they make software that goes on computers , and occasionally works .
they 're at sea for months at a time , and even when they 're on board , they don 't have access to what a five-year-old would take for granted , the internet .
in terms of carbon emissions per ton per mile , it emits about a thousandth of aviation and about a tenth of trucking .
i 'd been well treated by the crew , i 'd had a garrulous and entertaining captain , and i would happily have signed up for another five weeks , something that the captain also said i was crazy to think about .
but i was not limited when i sang , and as air came up from my lungs , through my vocal cords and passed my lips as sound , it was the closest thing i had ever come to transcendence .
if you run out of medicine , you definitely die .
i had to say goodbye in some way , shape or form .
i knew another young man , though , who had ph who died while waiting for one .
but organs don 't wait , and i went into surgery before i could say goodbye .
whether by a mack truck or by heart failure or faulty lungs , death happens .
we can now descend thousands of meters into the earth with relative impunity .
so descend into huautla plateau in mexico .
here 's a clip from a national geographic movie that came out in 1999 .
week after week , the melt probe will sink of its own weight through the ancient ice , until finally -- now , what are you going to do when you reach the surface of that ocean ?
this is all behavioral autonomy here that 's being conducted by the robot on its own .
the final missing piece , the real paradigm-buster , is this : a gas station on orbit .
we have to beat that .
i like this equipment , you know , and i really value it so we 're not going to burn the gear .

and she referred me to an orthopedic surgeon , also free .
" after you . " " oh , no , no . after you . "
my next surgeon 's appointment was , coincidentally , right after a shift at the gift shop .
if they 're really interested , they get the update as a text message on their cell phone .
one of the many ways that users shaped the evolution of twitter was by inventing a way to reply to a specific person or a specific message .
i have no idea what will happen next with twitter .
so , thank you very much , evan . ew : thank you .
he says , " of course they do . they go in the order in which they were built .
why do i do this ?
let 's take the example of electrical stimulation .
i invite you to talk about this with me further , and in the meantime , i wish you luck .
because that 's what will stop : economic growth .
the only problem with this plan is that it 's not possible .
we 've had economic analysis pointing out that , not only can we afford it , it 's cheaper to act early .
i want to talk to you about fear .
maybe fear .
and how cool would it be to tell your grandchildren that you were part of that ?
they 're wrong .
and the task was to build an ultralight indoor-flying model that is able to fly over your heads .
we have a split wing .
i 'll explain at another time .
you may remember that song , " we are the world , " or , " do they know it 's christmas ? "
and it 's a feeling i can 't ever quite forget .
americans , like irish people , are good at it .
the slow extinguishing of countless lives is just not dramatic enough , it would appear .
don 't you think that on a purely commercial level , that anti-retroviral drugs are great advertisements for western ingenuity and technology ?
well , much more than we think .
this room was born for this moment , is really what i want to say to you tonight .
but idealism allied with pragmatism , with rolling up your sleeves and making the world bend a bit , is very exciting . it 's very real . it 's very strong .
but there 's much more push from the ground than you 'd think , if we got organized .
a lot of people are getting together , and working under this umbrella i told you about earlier , the one campaign .
a few minutes ago , i talked about all the citizens ' campaigns that are springing up .
we have a film , produced by jon kamen at radical media .
we 're not asking for your money . we 're asking for your voice .
it 's a very , very good idea to get them wired .
now these are my comrades in arms .
you could drop an atom bomb on a city , and 30 years later it 's surviving .
you grow very quickly and then you stop .
before i talk about that , i 've written down at the bottom there the slope of this curve , this straight line .
is new york a scaled up san francisco , which is a scaled up santa fe ?
and what you see is a scaling phenomenon .
so if it is those networks and their mathematical structure , unlike biology , which had sublinear scaling , economies of scale , you had the slowing of the pace of life as you get bigger .
and the question is : can we , as socio-economic beings , avoid a heart attack ?
and then this is repeated across the entire spectrum of companies .
so designers work on this particular malaise that we have , these kinds of discomforts that we have , and try to make life easier for us .
so they construct it , and they can construct all kinds of forms at the nanoscale . this is the work of design students from the royal college of arts in london that have been working together with their tutor , tony dunne , and with a bunch of scientists around great britain on the possibilities of nanotechnology for design in the future .
something that you know can be done already is to grow bone tissue , so that you can make a wedding ring out of the bone tissue of your loved one -- literally .

when you come back out , you get to drop your vote into the ballot box where it mixes with all the other votes , so that no one knows how you voted .
and that means , if you mark your choices on one of them and then remove the candidate list , i won 't be able to tell from the bit remaining what your vote is for .
they can check that the announced result of the election is the correct one .
well , the classical approach consists of applying intervention that would promote the growth of the severed fiber to the original target .

you encounter it within minutes at a party , when you get asked that famous iconic question of the early 21st century , " what do you do ? "
we are now in a system where anyone can rise to any position they please .
it 's probably as unlikely that you would nowadays become as rich and famous as bill gates , as it was unlikely in the 17th century that you would accede to the ranks of the french aristocracy .

i went to talk to them about certain of the great tragedies of western art .
our heroes are human heroes .
i think any wise life will accept , as i say , that there is going to be an element where we are not succeeding .

and even before the fizz had gone out of our celebratory champagne , the taliban had taken over in kabul , and we said , " local jihad , not our problem . "
who killed bin ladenism ? al jazeera did , al jazeera and half a dozen other satellite news stations in arabic , because they circumvented the old , state-owned television stations in a lot of these countries which were designed to keep information from people .
but in all the many years that i have covered the middle east , i have never been as optimistic as i am today that the gap between the muslim world and the west is narrowing fast , and one of the many reasons for my optimism is that , because i know there are millions , hundreds of millions of people , muslims like that old imam in tunis , who are reclaiming this word and restoring to its original , beautiful purpose .
and often , i 'm driving in a taxi and i see a hole in a shirt , or something that looks very interesting or pretty or functional in some way that i 'd never seen happen before .

and you 're on the outside , you 're at home .
how many of you saw usa today , today ? there it is . looks like that .
now , which would you rather be ? a grid , or manifest destiny ?
it 's actually non-orthogonal : it 's not up and down , square , rectangular , anything like that , that you 'd see in a normal shape of a building .
and they said , well , it 's summer , what do you do ?
they were able to create that .
it 's all about sensuality . it 's all about touch .
try and build a political settlement first .
why does the politics get easier ?
the second actor , different cast of guys , is the donors .
and they are interdependent over a long term .
jobs .
and then when you try and expand it , because it 's shriveled away , you encounter a lot of bottlenecks .
the planning function and policy function stays with the ministry ; the delivery of services on the ground , you should use whatever works -- churches , ngos , local communities , whatever works .
so building clean government means , yes , provide money to the budget , but also provide a lot of scrutiny , which means a lot of technical assistance that follows the money .

the teapot problem i 'll pose this way .
so what one is interested in has a lot to do with the rewards of the system .

there 's no way of predicting the internet based on the first transistor .
one of them is from mr. einstein , and he says , " everything should be made as simple as possible , but not simpler . "

at the bottom of the cliff , we find that they 're rare as hens ' teeth .
there 's no roads into the sahara . it 's an enormous place .
you transported the bones out yourself to the coast of africa , onto a boat , if you wanted to get them out of the middle of the sahara .
it 's really a wholly separate radiation .
i 've got it . i 've got the back legs .
i 'm going to lead an expedition to the sahara to dig up africa 's largest neolithic site .
and so , in addition to digging , i think we have some answers from the dinosaur record . i think these dinosaurs migrated -- we call it dispersal -- around the globe , with the slightest land bridge .
i was a total failure in school , not really headed to graduate high school .
those are the questions i ask . and we talk about ethiopia , and it 's very important .
it 's hard to get them to envision themselves as a scientist , which involves standing up in front of people like we 're doing here at this symposium and presenting something as a knowledgeable person , and then seeing yourself in the role as a scientist and giving yourself the tools to pursue that .
now the easiest analogy for swap-trading is like an online dating service for all your unwanted media .
now i 'd like to say i woke up one morning and said , " i 'm going to write about collaborative consumption , " but actually it was a complicated web of seemingly disconnected ideas .
now we rationally know that an economy built on hyper-consumption is a ponzi scheme . it 's a house of cards .
it 's a scheme in the u.k.
instead , these people had to walk , bike , take the train , or other forms of public transport .
now all of these systems require a degree of trust , and the cornerstone to this working is reputation .
teachers paid less than what it costs them to be here .
one of the things i should probably tell you is , i worked for the discovery channel early in my career , and that sort of warped my framework .
and the answer is rather strange .
paragraph number two : you may actually have to just get very blunt and say what 's really on your mind .
then some droid in the back puts the name on a tickler and says , " oh , this is an important letter . "
i would move heaven and earth in order to get treatment for darius , and for me to be told that there might be other dariuses who are not getting treatment , that 's just viscerally wrong .
so , after that screening , we bring the children to the hospital .
so , we were fairly convinced -- we are convinced -- that recovery is feasible , despite extended visual deprivation .
so the world is this complex patchwork of regions .
patient : a square and a circle .
their acuity -- our acuity is 20 / 20 ; babies ' acuity is like 20 / 800 , so they are looking at the world in a very , very blurry fashion .
so we are pursuing this line of work and hopefully we 'll have more results to report soon .
this takes energy , producing clean water .
why are we having so much trouble dealing with these problems ?
and many of us here are deeply involved in that .
why is that ?
the question then is , how do we tap into this ?
the conventional wisdom has been that business actually makes a profit by causing a social problem .
it doesn 't waste resources .
that 's shared value .
how many of you are completely comfortable with calling yourselves a leader ?
and all of a sudden , you got to me , and you just stopped , and you stared . it was creepy . "
you have made someone 's life better by something that you said or that you did , and if you think you haven 't , think about all the hands that didn 't go back up when i asked that question .
most of the catadores work independently , picking waste from the streets and selling to junk yards at very low prices .
then , finally , painted by a street artist and become part of part of this huge , amazing mobile art exhibition .
geek . fatty . slut . fag .
and i wasn 't the only one .
from age 15 to 18 , i hated myself for becoming the thing that i loathed : a bully .
as far as i was concerned , life was pretty good .
he was three when he became a mixed drink of one part left alone and two parts tragedy , started therapy in eighth grade , had a personality made up of tests and pills , lived like the uphills were mountains and the downhills were cliffs , four fifths suicidal , a tidal wave of antidepressants , and an adolescence being called " popper , " one part because of the pills , 99 parts because of the cruelty .
why else would we still be here ?
i mean , they complain about it all the time .
the high-fear group , they laid it on really thick .
it was a notion that really came out of albert bandura 's work , who studied whether people could get a sense of empowerment .
and that doesn 't just work for me in terms of abstract numbers -- this overload of health information that we 're inundated with .
they reduce speeds by about five to 10 percent .
there is no good faith in this .
they 're packed with information .
we tell you that you 're okay , you 're normal .

another set of views of actually the gowanus canal itself .
this image is an image of an oyster cart , which is now as ubiquitous as the hotdog cart is today .
and that grows over time dynamically with the threat of climate change .
and the answer is : not yet , they 're working .
and she told all the other people , and she said , " how could it possibly be that something that 's cheap and simple works as well as something that 's complicated and expensive ? "
and what i 'd like to talk to you about today is some of the evidence why i believe this to be true : that for children two years old and up , there really is no real benefit -- proven benefit -- of car seats , in spite of the incredible energy that has been devoted toward expanding the laws and making it socially unacceptable to put your children into seatbelts . and then talk about why -- what is it that makes that true ?
and the standard error bands are relatively small around these estimates as well .
we can 't risk alienating them by testing seatbelts relative to car seats . "
and so this is a test that 's very much rigged in favor of the car seat , ok ? so , that kid in this crash fared very well .
and i just think that it 's interesting that the idea of using real-world crashes , which is very much something that economists think would be the right thing to do , is something that scientists don 't actually , usually think -- they would rather use a laboratory , a very imperfect science of looking at the dummies , than actually 30 years of data of what we 've seen with children and with car seats .
and it turned out that most people wouldn 't come back , because it worked . but every once in a while , there was still a patient convinced that he was sick , and he 'd come back . and my dad had a third jar of pills .
chromosome one , top left .
and that 200 is going to change to 600 this summer , and there 's no sign of this pace slowing .
she goes into respiratory failure and dies eight days later .
today it 's $ 10,000 . next year it 's $ 1,000 .
none , not one .
so anybody who 's here today with your significant other , just turn over to them and swab their mouth , send it to the lab and you 'll know for sure .
but maybe it 's a bad thing as well .
i 'm interested in the kind of constituency that thinks something along these lines : that thinks , " i can 't believe in any of this stuff .
i 'd like to kick off by looking at education .
this is simply not what our grandest and best institutes of higher learning are in the business of .
i 'm an independent , individual person . "
not so if you 're adopting a religious mindset .
and the moon and the reflection on the moon will have a secure place in your heart .
they tell us to have a bath .
they have no trouble telling us what art is about .
let 's think of something else .
so religions are the foremost example of an institution that is fighting for the things of the mind .
you can get shot by both sides .
there 's so much we can absorb .
so it 's a wiki project .
now , i want to take this problem seriously .
a recent study from [ university of michigan ] showed that these games are incredibly powerful relationship-management tools .
so i had to avoid everything that triggered my symptoms .
but even with a game so simple , within just a couple days of starting to play , that fog of depression and anxiety went away . it just vanished . it felt like a miracle .
we usually hear about post-traumatic stress disorder .
so here 's what we 're going to do .
now that 's worth plus-one mental resilience , which means you have more mental focus , more discipline , determination and willpower .
it 's my favorite superbetter trick , so keep it up .
wait , wait , wait .
it 's an incubator for about a dozen projects , all having to do with continuity over the long term .
how about underground with a view ?
and thanks to jay walker who was here and mitch kapor who was here , who started the process , long now was able to get that two-mile-long strip of land .
january 7003 . there it is .
it turns out that mount washington is covered with bristlecone pines .
well , a few years went by and there was some kind of back and forth , and by and by , thanks to mitch and jay , we were able to buy the whole property for 140,000 dollars .
they don 't quite , but it 's something to think about .
it 's this beautiful world all of its own , surrounded by cliffs , and it 's an easy hike to stroll up the canyon bottom , until you get to this barrier , and it actually presents a problem .
and he dashed across the top of the mountains .
that 's the long view . that 's 80 miles to the horizon .
in the front , there are 10 ranches strung right along the base of the mountains using the water from the mountains .
so that 's what the mountain taught us .
it activates what 's called the buzzing bridge , or the dog .
billy was supposed to be a tremendous ballplayer ; all the scouts told him so .
and yet , if you take , for example , subclinical osteoporosis , a bone thinning disease , the precondition , otherwise known as osteopenia , you would have to treat 270 women for three years in order to prevent one broken bone .
if i used someone else 's pre-death , i apologize , i think i made it up .
i went to medical school , and i didn 't have a course called how to think skeptically , or how not to order tests .
good morning . my name is david rose .
you 're right , integrity . because that 's the key thing .
next up is knowledge .
you 're going to keep my money alive and you 're going to make more money out of it .
you can 't say , " hey , i 've got high integrity , invest in me ! " right ?
okay , so how do you do that ?
on the other hand , there are a lot of things that drive me down , take the emotional level down , and you 've got to recover from those .
what do you think ?
i looked at the image -- a picture 's worth a thousand words .
it gives me the armature for the whole thing you 're going to be going through .
this helps to say you 're bigger than just one little thing over here .
you 're going to open an offshore plant in china , you 're going to spend it all on sales and marketing , you 're going to go to tahiti , or whatever out there .
and now , you 've got to wrap it up and tie it up here .
number four : always use remote control .
the average american watches tv for almost 5 hours a day .
that is separate and apart from the animal kingdom .
so i really hope our global audiences can relate .
take a look at this .
comfort is no longer why we watch television .
incredible mapping of our national psyche with some hard and fast facts : unemployment .
i can keep sarah palin 's daughter dancing .
and i guess we have a bit of news clip to precede .
david rockwell : the first experience people will have here when they see this is not as a construction site but as this incredibly moving burial ground .
and that as people who create places , the ultimate way to help wasn 't to pontificate or to make up scenarios , but to help right now .
and it wasn 't an inclusive group .
there was something about the comfort of the filter and how much information was between us and the experience .
dr : yeah . his initials are js , and he owns rockefeller center , if that helps anyone -- volunteered to help .
the next day i got an email from the developer saying that he was withdrawing all funding .
one of the other things is this is designed to be moveable .
it enables that conversation to get serious .
and the reason that 's been held up is essentially by community outrage that they 're not re-opening the street to connect that back to the rest of the city .
what 's interesting now is the nature of the site has totally changed , so that what you 're aware of is not just the destruction of the buildings in ground zero , but all of the buildings around it -- and the scars on the building around it , which are enormous .
i quickly made an arrangement with a red cross relief worker , who used his official van to transport the money to lungi airport , freetown , although he did not know the real contents of the box .
yeah , i was hanging out with some google guys last night .
i 'd basically distilled a very difficult-to-explain and complex philosophy , which i won 't get into here , because it 's a little too deep for all of you , but -- it 's about what makes websites popular , and , you know , it 's -- it 's unfortunate that i don 't have more time .
voice : hey , moron , get off the stage .
and chris had said in an email that , you know , we should really bring something new to ted , something that we haven 't shown anyone .
and the problem is that a lot of people suck at drawing , and they get bummed out at this , sort of , you know , stick figure , awful little thing that they created .
oh , this is how you make puppets .
well , it 's a technology for , first , salvation in its most basic sense .
well , so says george w. bush .
and these muslims -- and it 's the vast majority of muslims -- disagree profoundly with bin laden 's approach , profoundly .
in the most recent elections in the muslim world -- which are those in pakistan , those in morocco and those in turkey -- in each case , people who present themselves to the electorate as islamic democrats were far and away the most successful vote-getters every place they were allowed to run freely .
that 's not the way human circumstances operate .
he and i worked on it for several years , but it was the 1970s , and the technology that was available to amateurs just wasn 't there yet .
he said , " is the robot real ? "
we were totally surprised .
so he 's gotten robots to fly helicopters , do incredibly interesting , beautiful acrobatics , by watching human experts fly them .
so these are four of the lessons that i 've learned from robots over the years , and robotics , the field of robotics has gotten much better over time .
but i started getting very interested in maria montessori and her methods , and the way she went about things , and the way she thought it very valuable for kids to kind of discover things on their own rather than being taught these things overtly .
so here we are , at a very microscopic scale , swimming around . and i actually realize that cells don 't have eyes , but it helps to make it cute .
but basically , this is the editor where we 're going to design the next generation of our creature . so it has a little spine .
and then we can test it out , once we 've done that , and see how it would move around .
so far the entire game has been played on the surface of this little world here .
i can also play with the dynamics of this world over time .
let 's fly to another one .
but these are the things that we can kind of put in this little galaxy here .
i can love jogging .
these three intertwined processes have completely annihilated all the traditional bearings of western societies , with radical consequences for the individual .
we can envision two hypotheses : the first one consists of betting that this process of narcissistic capitalization will intensify .
but how ?
i refer specifically to a kind of humor that is unfortunately underused .
the means consist of noting something a little technical , st segment elevation of the electrogram -- translated into english , that means that if there 's an electrical signal in the heart , and one part of the ecg -- which we call the st segment -- elevates , that is a sure sign of a heart attack .
and then he did it again . we filled the balloon again a few minutes later and here you see , even after 10 seconds , a great rise in this piece , which we can have computers inside , under your chest like a pacemaker , with a wire into your heart like a pacemaker .
any one of you now is an expert on st elevation . can you see it there ?
and when you have a blockage , the alarm goes off and it sends the alarm and the electrogram to an external device , which gets your baseline electrogram from 24 hours ago and the one that caused the alarm , so you can take it to the emergency room and show them , and say , take care of me right away .
and here 's one of the patients who has an aura and always has a headache , bad one , after the aura . what do we do ?
cs : it 's been the most wonderful thing for my migraine .
here we have our device in which we put in a frame .
and by reducing malpractice litigation -- malpractice litigation is not an african problem ; it 's an american problem .
the high cost of health care in the us is partly due to litigation and insurance costs .
if a medical error occurs , the patient or spouse agrees to a settlement for fair compensation by arbitration instead of going to court .
rather than revolution , we 're much more interested in evolution , this idea that things gradually evolve by adapting and improvising to the changes of the world .
the first story starts last year when we went to shanghai to do the competition for the danish national pavilion for the world expo in 2010 .
and they chose this mascot because the theme of the expo is " better city , better life . "
but then we looked at recent urban development , and we noticed that this is like a shanghai street , 30 years ago . all bikes , no cars .
so the real mermaid , the real water , and the real bikes .
this is my apartment .
so if you go back into the parking , into the corridors , it 's almost like traveling into a parallel universe from cars and colors , into this sort of south-facing urban oasis .
we quite often make little movies .
thank you .
and soon thereafter there 's enough material left over that you get a primordial soup , and that creates life .
we 've upgraded time and again and again .
and when we find these , we may find differences .
three different options .
and one of the things you saw at ted about a year and a half ago was this guy .
here 's what it looks like in 2002 , 2006 , 2008 .
other people get hyper-sensitive to the amount of information .
that is not enough .
people adore the company . and it 's better , you know ? they like it .
those are the types of things that you will look at and feel .
why do we travel too much ?
these laptops , when a child opens them up , they communicate with every single child in the classroom , within that school , within that village .
" where did you do it ? " " in his car . "
i think this is a more powerful tool than the interstate highway act , and i think this is as important and world changing to our economy as electrification .
i was lucky enough to spend my last year , my fifth year , in rome as a student . it changed my life .
the primary reason for all these dead ends is when if you 're not quite sure where you 're going , you 're certainly not going to get there with any kind of efficiency .
she launches this thing above the spanish steps and sets off for an aerial tour of the city .
at the end of lunch , they untie the anchor , they set off through the baths of caracalla and over the walls of the city and then an abandoned gatehouse and decide to take one more look at the pyramid of cestius , which has this lightning rod on top .
everybody knows carletto , because he 's in entertainment , actually ; he 's in television .
but think of them as layers . i mean , rome is a place of layers -- horizontal layers , vertical layers -- and i thought , well just peeling off a page would allow me to -- if i got you thinking about it the right way -- would allow me to sort of show you the depth of layers .
so i went back to the notion of story , which is always a good thing to have if you 're trying to get people to pay attention to a book and pick up information along the way .
. that 's really going to go a long way .
and if you do want to see santa maria della pace , these books are really flexible , incredibly interactive -- just turn it around and look at it the other way .
every time school closed -- it was a boarding school and i was seven -- you had to travel until you find them .
the man with no legs says , " i can see as far as the end of the world , but i can 't save myself from a cat , or whatever animals . "
i 'm trying to improve infrastructure .
and what 's fantastic is that this symbol is not a thing , it 's not an image , it 's not an artifact , actually it 's a space , and it 's kind of just defined by a line of buildings on either side .
but beyond exhibiting contemporary art , the hirshhorn will become a public forum , a place of discourse for issues around arts , culture , politics and policy .
but how could it take the space of that hole and not be buried in it invisibly ?
the membrane is translucent .
and so we couldn 't really touch its surfaces .
but some of the toughest hurdles have been the technical ones .
using a campaign that encouraged people to abstain , be faithful , and use condoms -- the abc campaign -- they decreased their prevalence in the 1990s from about 15 percent to 6 percent over just a few years .
and in fact among gay men in the us we did see that kind of change in the 1980s .
but life expectancy in africa , even without aids , is really , really low : 40 or 50 years in a lot of places .
because if you improve those things , then people are going to have an incentive to avoid aids on their own .
now in the last few years , we actually have done some good testing .
and these are not trivial differences in mortality rates .
in africa , epidemiologists have noted for a long time that truck drivers and migrants are more likely to be infected than other people .
their exports went down a lot in the early 1990s -- and actually that decline lines up really , really closely with this decline in new hiv infections .
so thank you very much .
a camp counselor fortunately came over and separated us .
i tried kickboards .
and so his entire body really is underwater .
languages . material versus method .
i couldn 't read any of it -- hieroglyphics , it could have been -- because it was kanji , chinese characters adapted into the japanese language .
this is the difference between being effective -- doing the right things -- and being efficient -- doing things well whether or not they 're important .
she comes up , and this was her approach , the teacher .
i found that longer steps were much more elegant .
so then we broke it down .
thank you very much .
the whole first year was pass / fail , but the second year was graded .
i studied all the new things that had happened in solar cells , and was trying to look for ways we could innovate and make solar cells more inexpensively .
they take all the parallel incoming rays and focus it to a single spot .
we can control all 12 of these petals for under 50 dollars and what this would allow us to do is not have to move the focus any more , but only move the petals .
so , once you have mobility , now you 're making a lot of engines because you 've got lots of units , as opposed to steam ships or big factories where you 're not making as many units , so this was the engine that ended up benefiting from mass production where all the other engines didn 't benefit .
that 's basically the most fundamental heat engine you could possibly have .
it led to a very compact , inexpensive engine , and this is what the engine looks like .
what it does is it searches to find the hottest spot , it searches again a half an hour later , it searches again a day later , it searches again a month later .
this is how we would envision a residential application .
right now , solar paybacks are between 30 and 50 years .
we use portraiture as a way to deliver those lives , but that 's it .
well , they have other , little bit of advantage , but they also have some disadvantages , but the one thing they or we have is that we 've reached the point in life where we know how the story turned out .

this was a project to build a 4,000-ton nuclear bomb-propelled spaceship and go to saturn and jupiter .
it would take 2,000 or 3,000 bombs .
this is the real secret stuff : how to get directed energy explosions so you 're sending the energy of a nuclear explosion -- not like just a stick of dynamite , but you 're directing it at the ship .
and pulse system yield : we 're looking at 20-kiloton yield for an effect for us of 10 million newtons .
this project is hereby terminated .
for them , nations , countries , boundaries , borders still matter a great deal , and often violently .
the entire planet is covered by sovereign , independent nation-states .
so let 's apply this principle to siberia .
well it 's china 's turn again .
there is a treaty of nonaggression between countries , such that if there were a conflict between china and the united states , most countries vow to just sit it out , including american allies like korea and australia .
the kurds for 3,000 years have been waging a struggle for independence , and now is their chance to finally have it .
today donors are spending billions of dollars on this .
before it was , how do we control their oil ?
the european union began as just the coal and steel community of six countries , and their main purpose was really to keep the rehabilitation of germany to happen in a peaceful way .
that corridor of turkey and the caucasus has become the conduit for 20 percent of europe 's energy supply .
several weeks ago greenland 's [ 60,000 ] people voted themselves self-governance rights from denmark .
so i thought , " i guess i 'll pray to [ the ] unknown and ask help , " and started getting help from everywhere , each and every corner of my life at that time .
when i look back , you know , on what happened between that time and now here -- the last 10 / 15 years -- i can see that most of the works revolve around three subjects , but it was not intentional .
so this work is nothing but like -- because of the focal length of the lens , it just shows what is on the other side .
freud would say , " the fact that you 're at all concerned reveals your underlying sexual insecurity . "
this shows how limited our eye or hearing sense or touch -- do we really see ?
this is the fee for the project report , and we will give you all the details , " and they gave .
" of course not . for me , " i 'm thinking , " this is tucked in some small solid , but the moment it evaporates , it 's merged with the whole . "
so we don 't see dark , we don 't see light , we don 't see gravity , we don 't see electricity .
so that hole actually makes the air come out and go in .
i was this weird little kid who wanted to have deep talks about the worlds that might exist beyond the ones that we perceive with our senses .
and it can be sort of crazy-making , housing both the mystic and the warrior in one body .
if you are a republican , you can take a democrat to lunch , or if you 're a democrat , think of it as taking a republican to lunch .
i think it has relevance to any problem between people anywhere .
here 's how the great persian poet rumi put it : " out beyond ideas of wrong-doing and right-doing , there is a field .
unfortunately , what you hold in your hand has not only enabled incredible technological development and industrial expansion , but it has also contributed to unimaginable human suffering .
ted has always celebrated what technology can do for us , technology in its finished form .
why should we allow such a wonderful , brilliant and necessary product to be the cause of unnecessary suffering for human beings ?
i 'm going to ask you to imagine what a redwood really is as a living organism .
that is to say , at that time it was believed that there was nothing up there except the branches of redwood trees .
this is my daughter laura , then 15 , looking out of a tree boat .
it 's like scuba diving into a coral reef , except you 're going upward instead of downward .
and if we had redwood-like biology , we would have six layers of people on our hands , as it were .
what they 're doing in the redwood forest canopy soil hundreds of feet above the ocean , or how they got there , is completely unknown .
what can the redwoods tell us about ourselves ?
but that 's just a very small facet of a much greater problem of invasions of species worldwide , all through the ecosystems , and you know , the earth itself -- partly caused by us , inadvertently .
and this was all actually quite shocking to me , because prior to this moment , i had prided myself on having absolutely no regrets .
what is regret ?
here 's what the answers turn out to look like .
and the thought was , " make it go away ! "
so if you look at the psychological literature , these are the four consistent defining components of regret .
or you can just have an incredibly embarrassing day at work .
the third way that i think we can help make our peace with regret is through the passage of time , which , as we know , heals all wounds -- except for tattoos , which are permanent .
well it did .
what 's really interesting here is what you can do with it and the kind of interfaces you can build on top of it . so let 's see .
now , of course , i can bring up a keyboard .
it 's done by nasa . it 's a kind of -- we 've all seen google earth ; this is an open-source version of that . there are plug-ins to be able to load in different data sets that nasa 's collected over the years .
i 'm not the only one doing it ; there are a lot of other people getting into it .
for this climate crisis , we assembled a network , really , of superstars , from policy activists to scientists and entrepreneurs and business leaders . fifty or so of them .
we need wal-mart and every other company to do the same .
the third lesson we learned is that policy matters . it really matters .
he 's the father of the ethanol revolution .
so , a team of berkeley researchers with 15 million dollars from the gates foundation is engineering , designing a radical new way to make the key ingredient , called artemisinin , and they 're going to make that drug 10 times cheaper .
do you know , they only invested 0.2 percent of revenues in r & amp ; d ?
does anybody here have an answer for him ? i don 't .
because if we do , i can look forward to the conversation i 'm going to have with my daughter in 20 years .
seven .
so in march 2010 , we signed the first social impact bond with the ministry of justice around peterborough prison .
and even more worryingly , and this is a home office statistic , 70 percent of prostitutes have spent some time in care .
because normal contracting for things , when you 're spending government money , you 're spending our money , tax money , and the people who are in charge of that are very aware of it so the temptation is to control exactly how you spend it .
and in paris , the ipcc released its study confirming man 's impact on global warming .
and if you think it 's simply because we are not interested , you would be wrong .
and illiteracy has gone down , from a half to about a quarter of the people on earth .
there will be invisible capacity . invisible capacity in our bodies , in our brains , and in the air .
forget about pensions . think about life and where it 's going to be going .
we need to understand that the governance structure in the world is fossilized .
it 's not very good . it 's cluttered .
and if you 're happy with that , fantastic .
and this is a dynamic in which to succeed , players have to do something at a predefined time , generally at a predefined place .
but this could also be used for good .
and this is used in games as well .
we will find a way to move that blue line all the way to the right edge of the screen .
digg is a communal dynamic to try to find and source the best news , the most interesting stories .
it is very powerful . it is very exciting .
this is what i call the information mushroom .
so if we want to construct a time machine , we need two things .
actually probably 10 billion events can be extracted from this archive .
there are errors everywhere , errors in the document , it 's the wrong name of the captain , some of the boats never actually took to sea .
so what we must do for this paradigm shift is actually foster a new generation of " digital humanists " that are going to be ready for this shift .
i 'm talking about j.c.r. licklider 's human-computer symbiosis , perhaps better termed " intelligence augmentation , " i.a.
last year , on the site of the twin towers , the 9 / 11 memorial opened .
the major emphasis of most approaches to big data focus on , " how do i store this data ? how do i search this data ? how do i process this data ? "
so let 's explore , through a couple of examples , the impact that technologies built to drive human-computer symbiosis have had in recent time .
in january , 2010 , a devastating 7.0 earthquake struck haiti , third deadliest earthquake of all time , left one million people , 10 percent of the population , homeless .
and what i want to do today , for the first time , is show you a little bit of what we saw .
one even asks , like you just saw , is that bowl of pretzels there as a trick ?
in surveys , we found that it 's actually wealthier individuals who are more likely to moralize greed being good , and that the pursuit of self-interest is favorable and moral .
now in california , as you all know , because i 'm sure we all do this , it 's the law to stop for a pedestrian who 's waiting to cross .
we 're at unprecedented levels of economic inequality .
thank you .
that 's a piece of history , but it comes in a mathematical wrapping .
so i think in the next decade , the sciences and the humanities will come closer together to be able to answer deep questions about mankind .
but nevertheless , what the potential is -- and just keep looking there -- what the potential is , obviously , is to kind of move the border of who is the author , and who is the receiver .
do you see when i said in the beginning , it 's about why , rather than how ?
so these are different experiments with that . i won 't go into them .
or is that a three-hour hike , or is that a whole day i 'm looking at ? "
so , asked in that way , i think it raises great things about parliamentary ideas , democracy , public space , being together , being individual .
should it be a mastectomy ? should it be a lumpectomy ?
you are going to solve a series of puzzles , and i 'm going to show you examples of these puzzles momentarily .
we 'll give another five minutes for the ingredient to have its effects .
less effort , you 're less persistent , and so on .
volatile stock market , getting negative feedback that 's also immediate .
thank you .
this is a defibrillator , and this is a device that goes into a person to control their heart rhythm , and these have saved many lives .
now , they have two areas they can attack .
the results are astonishing , and when they gave this talk , even though they gave this talk at a conference to a bunch of computer security researchers , everybody was gasping .
this is what the phone looks like . it 's not really a phone .
that one 's pretty easy to fix .
if someone is able to put malware on your iphone , they could then maybe get the typing that you do whenever you put your iphone next to your keyboard .
okay , there 's a few heartbreaks that chocolate can 't fix .
thanks .
i tell people it involves creating poetry that doesn 't just want to sit on paper , that something about it demands it be heard out loud or witnessed in person .
step one was the moment i said , " i can . i can do this . "
and here 's what happens , and here 's what you would discover too if we all started sharing our lists out loud .
somebody once told me it 's like walking through life like this .
and that is step three : infusing the work you 're doing with the specific things that make you you , even while those things are always changing .
when my grandpa genji died , i was only five years old , but i took my mom by the hand and told her , " don 't worry , he 'll come back as a baby . "
and you , you get to share mine .
number one was asthma , number two was developmental delays , number three was 400-fold increases in rare childhood cancers in the last eight to 10 , 15 years .
and you can let them social network with your tadpole , because the environmental health clinic has a social networking site for , not only impatients , humans , but non-humans , social networking for humans and non-humans .
this was vodka and solution , gin and solution .
these are little opportunities to intercept those pollutants before they enter the harbor , and they 're produced by impatients on various city blocks in some very interesting ways .
so it 's on legs , so it focuses all the load on the masonry walls and the columns .
you know , coyote in central park , a whale in the gowanus canal , elk in westchester county .
healthy sub-populations of birds , increasing biodiversity generally .
in this case , instead of throwing chewing gum , or doritos or whatever you have in your pocket at the fish -- there 's a body of water in iceland that i 've been dealing with that 's in the middle of the city , and the largest pollution burden on it is not the roadborne pollution , it 's actually white bread from people feeding the fish and the birds .
and the way to it , for me , was through artistic means .
this was taken in the riviera sugar factory in red hook , brooklyn .
there 's nobody around you , and you hear the kids playing in the park above you , completely unaware of what 's underneath .
this children 's hospital was closed in 1997 ; it 's located in newark .
there are also phone cables that were used in the ' 50s and many bunkers from the world war ii era .
i 've been leaning towards more collaborative projects like these , lately .
we tried to answer this simple question : can you find a unifying language that cuts across age and income and culture that will help people themselves find a new way of living , see spaces around them differently , think about the resources they use differently , interact differently ?
people are ready and respond to the story of food .
we 've created a company . we are designing and building an aquaponics unit in some land that was spare at the back of the high school , like you do , and now we 're going to be growing fish and vegetables in an orchard with bees , and the kids are helping us build that , and the kids are on the board , and because the community was really keen on working with the high school , the high school is now teaching agriculture , and because it 's teaching agriculture , we started to think , how could we then get those kids that never had a qualification before in their lives but are really excited about growing , how can we give them some more experience ?
now , none of this is rocket science .
inspire local planners to put the food sites at the heart of the town and the city plan , not relegate them to the edges of the settlements that nobody can see .
the work involves hundreds of different crochet models .
i 've written books about the history of space , the history of physics and religion , and i write articles for people like the new york times and the l.a. times .
woolenness and wetness aren 't exactly two concepts that go together .
mathematicians like to characterize things by being formalist .
so we ask the question again , " how many straight lines can i draw through the point , but never meet the original line ? "
then our mathematicians come along and said , " there 's this thing called a sphere , and the lines come together at the north and south pole . "
their answer was interesting .
we live in a society that 's obsessed with presenting information in this way , teaching information in this way .
let me show you how it works .
the results of our work in the field are used to produce media and deliverables to be used by conservators and researchers .
luckily , in the last two or three decades , digital technologies have been developing that have helped us to develop tools that we 've brought to bear in the digital preservation , in our digital preservation war .
thank you .
optimism is sometimes characterized as a belief , an intellectual posture .
greenland remains . twenty-eight years ago , this is what the polar ice cap -- the north polar ice cap -- looked like at the end of the summer , at the fall equinox .
if it 's more being trapped on the way out , then you would expect it to be warmer here and cooler here . here is the lower atmosphere .
we have to have a unified view of how to go about this : the struggle against poverty in the world and the challenge of cutting wealthy country emissions , all has a single , very simple solution .
we can 't wait for the kind of drought australia had to change our political culture .
that hurts .
in terms of your own personal role going forward , al , is there something more than that you would like to be doing ?
i see you .
we tend to forget , though , the other audience that 's influenced by our nonverbals , and that 's ourselves .
and this is what happens when you put together high and low power . so what we tend to do when it comes to power is that we complement the other 's nonverbals .
so we know that our nonverbals govern how other people think and feel about us . there 's a lot of evidence .
so we know that in primate hierarchies , if an alpha needs to take over , if an individual needs to take over an alpha role sort of suddenly , within a few days , that individual 's testosterone has gone up significantly and his cortisol has dropped significantly .
here 's what we find on testosterone .
so we bring people into a lab , and they do either high- or low-power poses again , they go through a very stressful job interview .
i don 't want to get there and then still feel like a fraud .
you are going to fake it .
so this is two minutes .
so , we think a lot about what really makes science work ?
so that is both aristotelian cosmology , and in a certain sense , medieval society .
there 's only where it is relative to everything else that is .
so it works . but not only that , if you think about how natural selection works , then it turns out that natural selection would only make sense in such a relational universe .
and politics is , in the ideal sense , the way in which we continually address our network of relations in order to achieve a better life and a better society .
so that was a big wake-up call in the 1980 's .
we owe an incredible debt of gratitude to these two women .
it was a very big deal for her to become director .
ekg goes pbbrrhh , so the doctors can see this hugely abnormal ekg .
and you can see , it 's lumpy bumpy .
and that is microvascular obstruction .
that 's all stem cells .
so we 're 35 years behind .
as a magician , i try to create images that make people stop and think .
in 1987 i heard of a story about a boy that fell through ice and was trapped under a river .
but this is that attempt .
that was the one that i studied .
and you have these awful headaches .
i decided that i was going to break the world record live on prime-time television .
so , i would sleep in a hypoxic tent every night .
so , i did what any person seriously pursuing scientific advancement would do .
this time it started at 120 beats , and it never went down .
it was awful .
i had the world record and i wanted to make sure it was legitimate .
when i was born there was less than one billion children in the world , and today , 2000 , there 's almost two billion .
that 's where we find islamic majority .
i start the world , and here we go .
but there are also countries here like guatemala , like papua new guinea , like yemen and afghanistan .
you need to have access to some family planning .
i strongly recommend melinda gates ' last tedtalk .
so what will happen now is what we call " the big fill-up . "
i want to talk about 4.6 billion years of history in 18 minutes .
so , mars is a pretty big place even though it 's half the size .
we believe there 's some water in the polar caps , there are polar caps of north pole and south pole .
and this shows the percent . if it 's a blueish color , it means 16 percent by weight .
this is opportunity . this is spirit .
if any place in the world can build an airplane to fly on mars , it 's the langley research center , for almost 100 years a leading center of aeronautics in the world .
and we have it in something called an aeroshell .
we do our tests at 100,000 feet .
i have a big impact on the planet to travel here by plane .
it was impossible to do this picture 15 years ago .
every year we lose 50 thousand square miles in deforestation .
fifth ... from my childhood , fifth we were having fun , biking .
i still surf . i sail the world . i freedive .
and we humans have been walking upright for only 200 thousand years .
we haven 't yet understood that we 're going at a much faster pace than the planet can sustain .
they were sent down to find if there was any opportunity for selling shoes , and they wrote telegrams back to manchester .
what actually happened was the impulses were reduced .
i went back and i transformed my entire company into a one-buttock company . "
these are the people who think they 're tone-deaf .
do you know what i think probably happened in this room ?
now , chopin didn 't want to reach the e there , because what will have happened ? it will be over , like hamlet .
it 's the same gesture he makes when he comes home after a long day , turns off the key in his car and says , " aah , i 'm home . " because we all know where home is .
and i did exactly what i did with you , and i told them and explained them and the whole thing .
how would you talk ? how would you be ?
now , we 're all about to end this magical , on-the-mountain week , and we 're going back into the world .
where is the small hadron collider ?
most of the population growth of the next 50 years will be in cities .
millions of people living here , stretched over many kilometers .
the remarkable thing about these girls , and the sign of the kind of social revolution sweeping through the developing world is that these girls are not married .
most of the children there have parents who are illiterate .
and you also need to make it intrinsically interesting .
it has 30,000 children on those building sites .
when they got to a certain stage , pratham got big enough to attract some pro bono support from mckinsey .
they fail to reach the people they most need to serve .
and they all have the same kind of features : highly collaborative , very personalized , often pervasive technology , learning that starts from questions and problems and projects , not from knowledge and curriculum .
and we are bequeathing to the developing world school systems that they will now spend a century trying to reform .
these festivals are radically open .
an artist , i think , can really show us people that we might overlook in our lives .
came to see me and said , " 1,600 of the kids that we 've sent out have come back missing at least one full arm .
i still think you 're nuts . but not as nuts as i thought . "
going to scratch his nose .
there are more than 12,000 species of ants , in every conceivable environment , and they 're using interactions differently to meet different environmental challenges .
so in order to ask evolutionary questions , we need to know about reproductive success .
operating costs are low in the tropics , because it 's very humid , and it 's easy for the ants to be outside walking around .
but it would be interesting to know how other species solve this problem in different environments on earth , and so we 're setting up a program to encourage kids around the world to try this experiment with different species .
i had to figure out what it is my dad did and why it was important .
show everyone what you intend , " is what he said .
and moms grab their kids out of the way and say , " don 't stare ! "
no ! they 're not for safety .
we may put him away for life , but we watch him clinically .
he would say , " you 're right between horse and squirrel , john . "
hey , the name ajax -- you can 't get much more intentional than that , right ?
the given was replaced by various aspects of intent , by various designs , by various gods .
and i didn 't look like a soldier , that 's for sure .
an object devoid of intent -- it 's random , it 's imitative , it repels us . it 's like a piece of junk mail to be thrown away .
when we talk about corruption , there are typical types of individuals that spring to mind .
so it 's easy to think that corruption happens somewhere over there , carried out by a bunch of greedy despots and individuals up to no good in countries that we , personally , may know very little about and feel really unconnected to and unaffected by what might be going on .
take obiang junior . well , he didn 't end up with high-end art and luxury houses without help .
now shortly after our exposé , very shortly after our exposé earlier this year , the bank announced a policy review on this .
there 's corruption everywhere , so why focus on that sector ?
but as a campaigner and investigator , i have a different view , because i 've seen what can happen when an idea gains momentum .
i saw chains of jellyfish called siphonophores that were longer than this room , pumping out so much light that i could read the dials and gauges inside the suit without a flashlight ; and puffs and billows of what looked like luminous blue smoke ; and explosions of sparks that would swirl up out of the thrusters -- just like when you throw a log on a campfire and the embers swirl up off the campfire , but these were icy , blue embers .
and so i 've worked with computer image analysis engineers to develop automatic recognition systems that can identify these animals and then extract the xyz coordinate of the initial impact point .
and this fish , which is one of my favorites , has three headlights on each side of its head .
now we used to think that the different shape of the lure was to attract different types of prey , but then stomach content analyses on these fish done by scientists , or more likely their graduate students , have revealed that they all eat pretty much the same thing .
so i 'm holding it , and i 'm about to touch that tube on its shoulder , and when i do , you 'll see bioluminescence coming out .
so , i 've wanted for a long time to figure out a different way to explore .
it 's a magical place .
so i went into the library to figure out how did this thing work .
rory is a graduate student at stanford .
in the computer , you have all the data going through the central processing unit , and any piece of data basically has to go through that bottleneck , whereas in the brain , what you have is these neurons , and the data just really flows through a network of connections among the neurons . there 's no bottleneck here .
i mean , neurons have thousands of these .
and that means your computer is going to get its ones and zeros mixed up , and that 's going to crash your machine .
in fact , the processing that happens in that little piece of brain is very similar to the kind of processing that computers do when they stream video over the internet .
what you notice here is that these snapshots taken from the output of the retina chip are very sparse , right ?
it was very brute force ; it was very inelegant .
these are camels moving across the rift valley in africa , photographed by chris johns .
we were a little bit rattled .
and that is what nick did , up to a point .
the matriarch that they were radio tracking , after weeks of moving back and forth , in and out of the park , came to a halt outside the park .
and he did it in a beautiful way .
here is in the field hospital .
she 's probably -- it 's a shame you can 't see it in the photograph , but she 's 12 feet long .
one of the biggest challenges in computer graphics has been being able to create a photo-real , digital human face .
and , as a result , it 's a very good cue to the detailed shape of the skin-pore structure and all of the fine wrinkles that all of us have , the things that actually make us look like real humans .
so the next process was then to animate her .
have you ever noticed how much people moan about them ?
i think we should perhaps do a bit more of it .
i think , if you live with your head in the clouds every now and then , it helps you keep your feet on the ground .
and you 'll see them around where you live .
the sharp , crisp outlines of this formation make it the best one for finding shapes in .
for better or for worse , that 's what i 'm going to be known as , as the guy who knew a lot of weird stuff .
you know some beatles factoid that dad didn 't know .
i knew there were no computers that could do what you need to do to win on " jeopardy . "
and when the game eventually happened about a year later , it was very different than the " jeopardy " games i 'd been used to .
and you could hear that little tick , tick , tick , tick .
i 'm sure many of you remember a distant time when we had to know phone numbers , when we knew our friends ' phone numbers .
it 's doubling every 18 months now .
her parents thought about it , and they finally , to their credit , decided to believe her .
i don 't know if i want to live in a world where knowledge is obsolete .
i 've met a lot of them .
you might have had a french club or a debate club .
it 's very complicated , but it turns out they flap their wings very quickly .
so , for example , last year , the government of pakistan asked its internet service providers there to prevent citizens of pakistan from seeing youtube .
and here is the message where one of them says , " looks like we 've got a live one . we have a hijacking of youtube !
i have a theory i can explain later .
it does make you wonder if there were , for instance , a massive , extremely popular star trek convention one weekend , who would be minding the store ?
i mean , this is a 2005 business week cover .
and then have technology that the person taking the photo will know later , this person requested to be contacted before this goes anywhere big , if you don 't mind .
couchsurfing : one guy 's idea to , at last , put together people who are going somewhere far away and would like to sleep on a stranger 's couch for free , with people who live far away , and would like someone they don 't know to sleep on their couch for free .
for the answer to this , we turn to our spiritual path .
and those of you who are employers know exactly what i mean .
we have access to it all .
and therefore , for us to be human -- in the greatest sense of what it means to be human , in the most joyful sense of what it means to be human -- means that we too have to be proper stewards of the breath of divinity within us , and seek to perfect within ourselves the attribute of being , of being alive , of beingness ; the attribute of wisdom , of consciousness , of awareness ; and the attribute of being compassionate and loving beings .
i was excited .
i study this .
an 18-year-old boy who uses texting for almost everything says to me wistfully , " someday , someday , but certainly not now , i 'd like to learn how to have a conversation . "
and what i 'm seeing is that people get so used to being short-changed out of real conversation , so used to getting by with less , that they 've become almost willing to dispense with people altogether .
it doesn 't know life . "
it expresses , but it doesn 't solve , an underlying problem .
and if we don 't teach our children to be alone , they 're only going to know how to be lonely .
technology is making a bid to redefine human connection -- how we care for each other , how we care for ourselves -- but it 's also giving us the opportunity to affirm our values and our direction .
what do i mean by that ?
so , for example , in a distant era now , it was common when one gave a speech to basically talk like writing .
now we can write the way we talk .
very funny people , if that 's what lol means .
jake : " haha . slash i 'm watching this video with suns players trying to shoot with one eye . "
you can go even further back .
thank you .
actually he did , but it turned out to be the u.s. air force , which doesn 't count as extraterrestrial intelligence .
it 's exponentially improving . now , exponential is an overworked word . you hear it on the media all the time .
now , let me tell you about some aspect of this that people don 't think about , and that is , what happens ? suppose that what i say is true .
you 're not going to hear from alien neanderthals .
but those ants , even though most of them get wiped out , those ants are the ones that are essential to the survival of the hive . so exploration is important .
ask the next 10 people you see on the streets , " hey , do you think it 's worthwhile to spend billions of swiss francs looking for the higgs boson ? "
they get interested in something .
what they wanted was my email address so they could ask me more questions .
there 's a second way though , as well .
now , that 's a little unfair . some of my best friends are architects . and they definitely do have ears .
now that 's not just deaf children . that could be any child who 's got a cold , glue ear , an ear infection , even hay fever . on a given day , one in eight children fall into that group , on any given day .
we 're at last starting to debate this issue , and the benefits that are available for designing for the ears in education , unbelievable .
it 's time to start designing for the ears .
this is what we want .
so it turns out that design for inspiration doesn 't really -- i guess what i would say is , for us , for what i want to do , it 's either too slow or it just doesn 't work , it 's ineffective .
our other partner is east meets west .
so these dark blue squares show you where it 's effective phototherapy .
they 're inexpensive , really rugged .
so the idea here is we say , you want to make it hard to use wrong .
i have to accept that there are no dumb users , that there 's only dumb products .
and then , to have to deal with large groups , say , at the nation-state level , and we had to have mutual non-aggression , or through a series of conflicts , we eventually came to a rough international bargain to largely keep the peace .
so these are the kind of thoughts i was thinking in 1999 and 2000 , and my friends told me i was getting really depressed , and they were really worried about me .
the first is this whole area of education , and it really relates to what nicholas was talking about with a $ 100 computer .
we 've made improvements in energy and resource efficiency , but the consumer sector , especially in america , is very inefficient .
i had one business plan where i was trying to learn more about witten 's cosmic dimension strings to try to understand what the phenomenon was going on in this proposed nanomaterial .
we need rapid diagnostics so that we can tell if somebody has a strain of flu which we have only identified very recently .
and if you apply the notion of insurance more broadly , you can use a more powerful force , a market force , to provide feedback .
server : may i help you , sir ?
that started my love for technology .
and i thought , i can start my own business .
but it 's never enough to just to get it through your heads about the things that are happening in our world .
acknowledging that god is unknown and unknowable by definition .
in some way the eternal god must be able to enter into the souls of human beings and experience the torment within .
then in the same week , at a funeral , we sang the familiar hymn " we plow the fields and scatter , " a very english hymn .
a god who looks after his own , so that christians are ok , while everyone else perishes ?
we must think again about god .
how does this in-ness , this innerness , this interiority of god work ?
and how would one deepen such a faith ?
yb : to the dismay of my mother , this is dangerous teenage fashion right there .
and my mum said , " darling , remember that you can 't see and you can 't feel the picture and you can 't feel the print on the page . "
when i was at school , the books were transcribed by transcribers , voluntary people who punched one dot at a time so i 'd have volumes to read , and that had been going on , mainly by women , since the late 19th century in this country , but it was the only way i could read .
it 's a blind computer .
and now i can scan the latest novel and not wait to get it into talking book libraries .
i still love being close to someone reading to me .
it 's something that a group of countries and the world blind union are advocating , a cross-border treaty so that if books are available under a copyright exception and the other country has a copyright exception , we can transport those books across borders and give life to people , particularly in developing countries , blind people who don 't have the books to read .
how would you tell the time , say , 600 years ago ?
the ecliptic , which is the path of the sun , moon , and planets correspond to an offset circle .
and this one , this is a replica from a 15th-century device .
right . so , that 's how the device is used .
the concept of stereographic projection originated in 330 b.c.
knowing the sky , knowing your relationship with the sky , is the center of the real answer to knowing what time it is .
and actually , about a year or so ago , there was this promulgation of the idea of google flu trends , with respect to the flu , where by looking at people 's searching behavior today , we could know where the flu -- what the status of the epidemic was today , what 's the prevalence of the epidemic today .
and different sorts of things spread across different sorts of ties .
and in fact , if you could do that , what you would see is something like this .
and in fact , it happens throughout the network as you move in , everyone you pick , when they nominate a random -- when a random person nominates a friend of theirs , you move closer to the center of the network .
now in our case , although it wasn 't necessary , we could also actually map the network of the students .
so , for example , most of you are probably familiar with the notion of herd immunity .
and in fact , we are in the era of what i would call " massive-passive " data collection efforts .
it 's sort of like when galileo invented -- or , didn 't invent -- came to use a telescope and could see the heavens in a new way , or leeuwenhoek became aware of the microscope -- or actually invented -- and could see biology in a new way .
it allows us to store some immediate experiences and a little bit of knowledge .
okay . what i want you to do is i want you to tell me what the answer is to 23 times eight .
we can have a conversation , and i can build a narrative around that so i know where we 've been and where we 're going and how to contribute to this conversation .
and you 're really hoping the answer is no , because that 's what you 're about to say .
what we want to do is spin that around .
thank you so much , chris . and it 's truly a great honor to have the opportunity to come to this stage twice . i 'm extremely grateful .
there 's been kind of a series of epiphanies .
i add new images because i learn more about it every time i give it .
figure out some of the other options that are much better . it 's important .
and so i 'm going to be conducting a course this summer for a group of people that are nominated by different folks to come and then give it , en masse , in communities all across the country , and we 're going to update the slideshow for all of them every single week to keep it right on the cutting edge .
we are one .
so here 's the description of a group i found on the web .
but i 'm here today to give you a choice .
the first one is harm / care .
this painting is called " the allegory of chastity , " but purity 's not just about suppressing female sexuality .
for liberals , the scores are very low .
but if you 're conservative , that 's not so attractive .
and what happens is that , at first , people start off reasonably cooperative -- and this is all played anonymously .
it 's not that complicated .
they want order , even at some cost to those at the bottom .
now unfortunately , it 's a disease that has been caught by many of the world 's leaders .
people here are passionately engaged in trying to make the world a better place .
our brain weighs between 1.2 and 1.5 kilos , but elephant brains weigh between four and five kilos , and whale brains can weigh up to nine kilos , which is why scientists used to resort to saying that our brain must be special to explain our cognitive abilities .
but nobody did .
so this brings us to a very important conclusion already , which is that we are not rodents .
so we did the math .
so i think this explains why the human brain grew to become so large so fast in evolution , all of the while remaining just a primate brain .
" come on adam , don 't be so wishy-washy . take a bite . " " i did . "
they didn 't get in as much trouble . they were better students .
namely , the extent to which you have one of these biased time perspectives .
and they live for work , achievement and control .
three : i failed to realize that homelessness is an attitude , not a lifestyle .
and i faced a whole new set of challenges .
and he was doing the talk show circuit . and he was talking about my writing .
the human spirit can overcome anything if it has hope .
i trained briefly as a buddhist monk under this guy .
we 've got to do whatever we can to help them , but we 've also got to ask , i think , a more profound question of whether we use this crisis to jump forward to a different kind of economy that 's more suited to human needs , to a better balance of economy and society .
surely , we should be giving the money to entrepreneurs , to civil society , for people able to create the new , not to the big , well-connected companies , big , clunky government programs .
and what 's striking though , is that in society there 's almost nothing comparable , no comparable investment , no systematic experiment , in the things capitalism isn 't very good at , like compassion , or empathy , or relationships or care .
across northern europe , many governments now have innovation laboratories within them .
then monarchy had seen off its big challenger , mass democracy , which was seen as a well-intentioned but doomed experiment , just as capitalism has seen off socialism .
in fact , i see it more as a spiral .
they come in a lot of different shapes .
so the unexpected consequences of that is that you only see one part of your image , so it makes a very freestyle architecture .
here it 's " candycity . "
so in life and in papercutting , everything is connected .
you have people renting their wings in the heavens .
i love public art .
and outside the library , i wanted to make a place to cultivate your mind .
so i brought back the rabbit , the dragonfly , to stay in that street .
the answer is boxers .
and europe , which is right now in the middle of the day , is going really strong with a whole wide variety of languages .
now , each one of those queries has an interesting life and tale of its own .
one of the earlier results that we got -- we have a singaporean businessman who is now sponsoring a village of 25 vietnamese girls for their education , and that was one of the earliest results . and as i said , now there have been many , many stories that have come in , because we do have hundreds of charities in there , and the google foundation will be an even broader endeavor .
so this is how -- we just deployed it -- we just decided that people would send each other invitations to get into the service , and so we just had the people in our company initially send them out .
and then , besides just looking cute on a baby 's bottom , we made it a googlette , which is basically a small project at google .
so this is a new -- how many of you use the google toolbar ?
this is actually our " cult picture . "
and , you know , thank you .
and our algorithms -- not a person , of course , but our algorithms , our computers -- read his blog and decided that the related search was , " i am bored . "
and so , needless to say , over those years i 've had a chance to look at education reform from a lot of perspectives .
i think stephen covey had the right idea .
you just have to strut . "
" + 2 " said , " i ain 't all bad . "
is this job tough ? you betcha . oh god , you betcha .
comparing your rates of dying 50 degrees north -- that 's the south , that 's london and places -- by latitude , and 55 degrees -- the bad news is that 's here , glasgow .
so what i 'm going to suggest is that vitamin d is not the only story in town .
and i was interested in these really complex systems .
when we put people under a lamp for the equivalent of about 30 minutes of sunshine in summer in edinburgh , what we produced was , we produced a rise in circulating nitric oxide .
and what we 've shown is that doing a sham irradiation -- this is the thick line here -- this is shining uv on the arm so it warms up but keeping it covered so the rays don 't hit the skin .
we 're still working at this story , we 're still developing it , we 're still expanding it .
it turned out that most big criminal justice agencies like my own didn 't track the things that matter .
when i became attorney general , i could look at the system as a whole , and what surprised me is that i found that that was exactly how we were doing it across the entire system -- in police departments , in prosecutors 's offices , in courts and in jails .
and we face unbelievable public safety challenges because we have a situation in which two thirds of the people in our jails are there waiting for trial .
and he stayed in jail for eight months until his case came up for trial , at a cost to taxpayers of more than 9,000 dollars .
first , whether or not someone will commit a new crime if they 're released .
it 's how we can make our streets safer , we can reduce our prison costs , and we can make our system much fairer and more just .
it 's a nice description because it 's starting from left -- you have the stones -- immediately after the stones , the plants that are just able to live .
now , the story that plants are some low-level organisms has been formalized many times ago by aristotle , that in " de anima " -- that is a very influential book for the western civilization -- wrote that the plants are on the edge between living and not living .
this is one , mimosa pudica .
no one was allowed to speak about movement in plants before charles darwin .
and why are they so similar ?
and these are three possibilities that we are working on to build hybrids , driven by algae or by the leaves at the end , by the most , most powerful parts of the plants , by the roots .
for half a month i looked for these 6 people to participate in my work .
interpreter : this is the ancient city of pompeii .
i think that in art , an artist 's attitude is the most important element .
and be careful , your genes are in danger .
and so does your [ bleep ] . these days , with a hair-free back , well-groomed shoulders and an extra optical inch on my [ bleep ] , well , let 's just say life has gotten pretty darn cozy .
now this region 's very diverse , and every country is unique .
as early as 2001 , we asked arabs , and muslims in general around the world , what they admired most about the west .
but most of all , for the first time in decades , they expect to be active participants , not spectators , in the affairs of their country .
and that is egyptians ' elevated expectations are placed first on themselves .
what this means is that human development , not secularization , is what 's key to women 's empowerment in the transforming middle east .
suppose we 're distributing flutes .
well , it 's a good reason .
now that would give you an unfair advantage . "
yes , all right .
charley : i 'll stick to my original thesis .
and justice stevens , writing for the majority , said he had read all about the history of golf , and the essential point of the game is to get very small ball from one place into a hole in as few strokes as possible , and that walking was not essential , but incidental .
because what was at stake in the dispute over the golf cart was not only the essential nature of golf , but , relatedly , the question : what abilities are worthy of honor and recognition as athletic talents ?
thank you very much .
michael sandel . thank you so much .
audience : fold . js : really loud .
how ? as soon as it starts , you just tear it off .
our economy was based on commodities , so the price of cotton or the price of wheat , and ultimately the price of oil and natural gas .
now the city i inherited was just on the verge of coming out of its slumbering economy , and for the very first time , we started showing up on the lists .
and i had this huge closet full of clothes , and i could only wear a third of it at any one time , and only i knew which part of the closet i could wear .
and so , on new year 's eve of 2007 , i went to the zoo , and i stood in front of the elephants , and i said , " this city is going on a diet , and we 're going to lose a million pounds . "
we 're building senior health and wellness centers throughout the community .
we were on the list as the 22nd fittest city in the united states .
we try to avoid blowing ourselves up .
so , we used to have a celebration every year and select -- there used to be competition and parades and so on .
i 'm morgan hendry . i am nasa .
you know , it 'll take us only six months to get there .
so , specifically what we are doing now is that rover is going down in that crater .
now , during that whole period , a number of people got excited , you know , outside the science community about these rovers , so i thought i 'd show you a video just to give you a reflection about how these rovers are being viewed by people other than the science community .
and as you can see , this is a picture of the spacecraft put on mars , but i thought that just in case you 're going to miss that show , you know , in 17 days , i 'll show you , kind of , a little bit of what 's going to happen .
it probably gets about room temperature .
so by the time you even hear from the lander that edl has started it 'll already be over .
if you are going to jupiter , you have a very high-radiation , you know , environment . it 's about the same radiation environment close by jupiter as inside a nuclear reactor .
actually , the lander will come down to about 100 feet and hover above that surface for 100 feet , and then we have a sky crane which will take that rover and land it down on the surface .
this is actually taken from the satellite that we have in orbit around saturn , the cassini .
and the reason i showed the little arrow there , i think that should say 30 miles , we decided a few months ago to actually fly the spacecraft through the plume of that geyser so we can actually measure the material that it is made of .
so if you were on mars -- sorry , on titan , you don 't have to worry about four-dollar gasoline .
but beyond the impact of a health condition on life expectancy , we 're also concerned about the quality of life lived .
soon after my training , i found myself working first in zimbabwe and then in india , and i was confronted by an altogether new reality .
we need to unpack complex health care interventions into smaller components that can be more easily transferred to less-trained individuals .
for instance , me and my sister , when we were little , we would compete to see who could eat the most squirrel brains .
so i thought , okay , i have to have some criteria of how to choose work .
and i 'm going to create this in two years , and i have .
so this piece was great fun because it was two days of digging in soft dirt .
he draws sticks real good . "
next is sylvia slater .
and i was like , " get dressed for a funeral . we 're going to go do some work . "
the next artist is hazel clausen .
and i love maynard sipes , but he 's off in his own world , and , bless his heart , he 's so paranoid .
and she 's an optometrist in st. petersburg , and she plays with optics .
so , to make a long story short , they came to canada .
and being naive about the whole field , i kind of thought , " oh , you have cell death in alzheimer 's which is causing the memory deficit , and then you have this compound -- purine derivatives -- that are promoting cell growth . "
and the cancer , the body is saying the lung tissue is damaged , we need to repair the lung . and cancer is originating in the lung trying to repair -- because you have this excessive proliferation of these remarkable cells that really have the potential to become lung tissue .
so the fact that not only did cancer not seem to originate in skeletal muscles , but cancer didn 't seem to go to skeletal muscle -- there seemed to be something here .
16 percent ! meaning that there were these pinpoint tumors in skeletal muscle , but only .16 percent of actual metastases -- suggesting that maybe skeletal muscle is able to control the angiogenesis , is able to control the tumors recruiting these blood vessels .
muscle is constantly being used -- constantly being damaged .
in that hospice , there were 31 men and women who were actively dying .
they touched me at that time .
that compassion is actually an inherent human quality .
most of us are shrinking in the face of psycho-social and physical poisons , of the toxins of our world .
step back , give your mother a break , okay .
and i 'll try to do all that in 20 minutes . i have two affiliations .
i thought the word framework was great .
but i 'm doing it now , and i 'm going to tell you about it .
and it goes back and forth , you know ?
and it 's also , although the brain looks very complicated , things look complicated until you understand them .
they all have a lot in common with brain science .
so what is the intuitive , but incorrect assumption , that 's kept us from understanding brains ?
and here 's how that happens . let 's start with a non-intelligent brain .
and so as the sensory input comes in and feeds from the old brain , it also goes up into the neocortex . and the neocortex is just memorizing .
and when you go home tonight , you 're going to put your hand out there , and you 're going to reach for the doorknob and you 're going to notice it 's in the wrong spot , and you 'll go , whoa , something happened .
every single moment . and finally , let 's think about how we test intelligence .
first of all , it 's going to be a theory about memory .
the new brain is actually kind of easier than the old brain .
that wasn 't being asked .
ironically , at that time in my life , i was also doing cancer research , immune-based therapies for melanoma , to be specific , and in that world i was actually taught to question everything , to challenge all assumptions and hold them to the highest possible scientific standards .
and underlying these questions , i became almost maniacally obsessed in trying to understand the real relationship between obesity and insulin resistance .
how much better would we be if we treated the cause -- telling people to pay attention when they walk through the living room -- rather than the effect ?
it 's more likely too much glucose : blood sugar .
first , how do the various foods we consume impact our metabolism , hormones and enzymes , and through what nuanced molecular mechanisms ?
as you 're all aware , we face difficult economic times .
another spooky property is that it flows with absolutely no viscosity or friction , so if you were to take the lid off that bottle , it won 't stay inside .
there are hundreds of dancing scientists waiting for you .
our leaders are working tirelessly to try and find ways to save money .
it 's sort of the good old , traditional form of terrorism , but it 's sort of been packaged for the 21st century .
we 've mentioned the health , but it needs consumers to buy into it .
we 've got to engage , we 've got to educate , and we 've got to have dialogue .
the son 's dead . the father lives .
it 's human nature .
the first one has been dubbed " lawfare , " for want of a better word .
but the problem is , we need more and more support for these ideas and cases .
the private sector has a role .
sitting is so incredibly prevalent , we don 't even question how much we 're doing it , and because everyone else is doing it , it doesn 't even occur to us that it 's not okay .
walk the talk .
and , you know , lots of countries do this . he was writing initially about the states , but we know the alliance francaise is all about french soft power , the british council .
in fact , they were so rare that elected members of parliament had the right to allocate 15 telephone lines as a favor to those they deemed worthy .
and it 's the best thing and the most nutritious and refreshing thing you can drink on a hot day in the tropics , so i said sure .
and this is happening more and more .
as a student in the mid ' 70s , i knew what the image of india was then , if there was an image at all .
so , maybe -- oh sorry , he is christian , i beg your pardon -- and he is male , but he isn 't white .
the great success story of india , a country that so many learned scholars and journalists assumed would disintegrate , in the ' 50s and ' 60s , is that it managed to maintain consensus on how to survive without consensus .
for me , that was the white space ; that 's what robots could not do yet .
leo , cookie monster is very bad .
he 's a psychologist we 've been collaborating with .
it turns out , when you add mobility -- the ability to roll around the table -- you get a little more of a boost .
cory kidd developed this robot for his doctoral work .
so the first thing i want to look at is how long , how long did people interact with these systems .
another important idea is this notion of persistence of character across realities .
thank you .
and it 's at the hair cell level that they do this .
and that was the best you could do for hearing loss .
so it comes in handy to not be annoyed by her .
you don 't care that the word sounded pretty when it was spoken .
that 's kind of hypnotic .
go ahead and play that .
cl : now i 'm not suggesting that the cat is hearing that trumpet the way we 're hearing it .
and the fact that he can play the piano like that is a testament to his brain .
my little boy reminded me that for all the technology and all the toys in the world , sometimes just a small block of wood , if you stack it up tall , actually is an incredibly inspiring thing .
that 's 40 percent of the world that are going to need a new building built for them in the next 20 years .
but if you take that wood and you put it into a building or into a piece of furniture or into that wooden toy , it actually has an amazing capacity to store the carbon and provide us with a sequestration .
i 'm just going to focus on a few of them , and let 's start with fire , because i think fire is probably the first one that you 're all thinking about right now .
think back to that three billion people that need a new home , and maybe this is a contributor to reducing .
i 'd like you all to ask yourselves a question which you may never have asked yourselves before : what is possible with the human voice ?
and before i start making noises with it , and using it to manipulate my voice , i want to reiterate that everything that you 're about to hear is being made by my voice .
so that 's cool .
there 's been four billion years of organic , biological life .
biologists seem to think so .
is life that improbable ? "
synthetic biologists are manipulating it .
we then got to the last ancestor .
in my own laboratory , the way we 're trying to create inorganic life is by using many different reaction formats .
carbon is banned .
so that means we could then start to develop different platforms for exploring this evolution .
and we 're really becoming very close to understanding the key steps that makes dead stuff come alive .
so the other thing that if we were able to create life that 's not based on carbon , maybe we can tell nasa what really to look for .
as walt whitman once said , he said , " oh , i would stake all for you . "
i am told you will leave me here .
you can 't stop thinking about another human being .
it comes from a david mamet play , and there 's two con artists in the play , and the woman is conning the man , and the man looks at the woman and says , " oh , you 're a bad pony , i 'm not going to bet on you . "
i 've got a girlfriend who 's just getting over a terrible love affair .
our newest experiment has been hatched by my colleague , art aron -- putting people who are reporting that they are still in love , in a long-term relationship , into the functional mri .
i 'm putting the data together now , and at some point -- there will always be magic to love , but i think i will come closer to understanding why it is you can walk into a room and everybody is from your background , your same general level of intelligence , your same general level of good looks , and you don 't feel pulled towards all of them .
i used to be a malthusian .
most of our cultural heritage has tended to look backward , romanticizing the past .
bill gates is one of those smartest guys of ours that work on these problems and he also funds this work , so thank you .
it vends out little individual vials .
and bed nets have an effect on the epidemic , but you 're never going to make it extinct with bed nets .
it creates a very high peak power and it lets you do all kinds of interesting things ; in particular , it lets you find hemozoin .
you then have to introduce the mosquitoes , and you have to model that and how they come and go .
what can we do to the mosquito ?
moore 's law made computing cheap ; so cheap we can weigh the life of an individual insect and decide thumbs up or thumbs down .
now , this is a low powered laser , and we can actually pick up a wing-beat frequency .
it poses a very fascinating puzzle for us .
the real challenge then , is to try to figure out how we can change rules .
what haiti warns us is that rules can be bad because governments are weak .
but , to get on a process of increasing income , increasing skills led to very rapid growth there .
you 'll need to attract firms , who will come hire the people who move there first .
the thing that was bad about colonialism , and the thing which is residually bad in some of our aid programs , is that it involved elements of coercion and condescension .
it 's a rule for changing rules .
so what will it take to get started building the first charter cities , scaling this so we build many more ?
when we share ideas we all get more .
and not just individual machines , but fleets of locomotives , airplanes , entire systems like power grids , hospitals .
by the time it lands , they will already know if anything needs to be serviced .
she already has all the spare parts , because the problems were diagnosed in advanced .
they say that all the growth-enhancing innovations are behind us .
so think about the future — it will be here soon enough .
that 's better . and of course , in principle , you could do three , four or more , but it starts to get very difficult .
there 's another group of people who seem to have a firm grip on equilibrium analysis , because they 're picking zero or one .
so we know that those two-step players are doing something differently .
first some behavior . so a bunch of the subject pairs , they play face to face .
and by the way , these were trials where their deals were made .
so how humans and chimpanzees behave differently might tell us a lot about brain evolution .
the chimps are actually interacting with each other through the computers .
they 're actually closer than any species we 've observed .
this battle defined the first 150 years of the u.s. economy , and at every moment , different partisans saying , " oh my god , the economy 's about to collapse , " and the rest of us just going about , spending our bucks on whatever it is we wanted to buy .
the republicans say , hey , no , no , we 've got a better idea .
when you look at how the federal government spends money , so this is the battle right here , 55 percent , more than half , is on social security , medicare , medicaid , a few other health programs , 20 percent defense , 19 percent discretionary , and six percent interest .
i should also note that the [ discretionary ] spending , which is about 19 percent of the budget , that is democratic and republican issues , so you do have welfare , food stamps , other programs that tend to be popular among democrats , but you also have the farm bill and all sorts of department of interior inducements for oil drilling and other things , which tend to be popular among republicans .
it 's still ugly to this day , but in my experience , it is really , really hard to find an economist under 40 who still has that kind of way of seeing the world .
so what we have , then , when you think about the fiscal cliff , don 't think of it as the american people fundamentally can 't stand each other on these issues and that we must be ripped apart into two separate warring nations .
but the more we address it as a practical concern , the sooner we can resolve it , and the more time we have to resolve it , paradoxically .
i mean , i love the stuff .
he placed first for his foie gras .
as funny as it sounds , articulating it now and reading about it -- actually , if we had talked about it before this controversy , i would have said , " that 's kind of true . "
and he stopped doing this .
i mean , his farm is incredible .
it 's the indication that it 's the best foie gras .
and he grabs my arm and the translator 's , and ducks us under a bush and says , " watch this . "
their dna is to find the conditions that are conducive to life .
and i say to you , i might not stick to this , but i don 't think i 'll ever serve foie gras on my menu again because of that taste experience with eduardo .
how come no one 's really heard of you ? "
the history of foie gras .
supposedly , anyway . i believe that one .
one in which we stop treating the planet as if it were some kind of business in liquidation .
i arrived in afghanistan in 1990 to work in a hospital for war victims .
i was coming back from a big food distribution in a mosque where tens and tens of people were squatting in terrible conditions .
well without thinking , i told him " come tomorrow .
and the gatekeeper told me , " they come everyday to see if the center will open . "
so we started .
suddenly , they started fighting .
he needed to change his prostheses -- a new pair of prostheses .
and then he added something i will never forget for the rest of my life .
one week later , mahmoud was the fastest in the production line .
everybody benefits from that -- those employed , of course , because they get a job and dignity .
they are my teachers .
what 's next ? what is going to be the next change ?
is it because i 'm a professor , and , therefore , i must be entitled to this reward from society ? "
the research guidelines of u.s. national academy of sciences or research councils of the u.k.
i 'm so sorry to say that .
do poor have legs , mouth and hands , but no head ?
i 've walked about 4,000 kilometers in the last 12 years .
look at what sheikh jahangir has done .
it 's a hot plate made of clay .
things can scale up , and they have scaled up .
my technology .
but he has modified a two-wheeler so that he can get autonomy and freedom and flexibility .
and this breathing apparatus now saved the life , and she 's very welcome .
thank you .
what is this about ?
once again , most of that doesn 't get paid .
and these are percentages versus the original state , so to speak , the pre-industrial era , 1750 .
and here 's what the same calculation looks like , which was done recently -- well i say recently , over the last 10 years -- by a group called trucost .
calculating this at the national level is one thing , and it has begun .
now that 's not a happy situation for them , but they have the confidence and the courage to come forward and say , " here 's what we are measuring .
thankfully , the flux , in other words , the flow of emissions from the ocean to the atmosphere and vice versa , is more or less balanced .
because mother nature only has that much in ecological infrastructure and that much natural capital .
i didn 't have have many personal friends to spend time with , but i was expected to perform these prescribed duties .
tc : my relationship to this concept of heart-to-heart connection , or mind-to-mind connection , is an interesting one , because , as a spiritual leader , i 'm always attempting to open my heart to others and offer myself up for heart-to-heart and mind-to-mind connections in a genuine way with other people , but at the same time , i 've always been advised that i need to emphasize intelligence over the heart-to-heart connections , because , being someone in a position like mine , if i don 't rely primarily on intelligence , then something dangerous may happen to me .
td : so , since we 've been here this week , we 've taken millions of breaths , collectively , and perhaps we haven 't witnessed any course changes happening in our lives , but we often miss the very subtle changes .
and one of the journalists said to her , what 's up ?
it grew up in response to the atrocities in darfur .
now , what this movement has done is it has extracted from the bush administration from the united states , at a time of massive over-stretch -- military , financial , diplomatic -- a whole series of commitments to darfur that no other country in the world is making .
as we saw , they haven 't even gravitated towards protecting our ports or reigning in loose nukes .
he was bobby kennedy-like because in some ways one could never tell if he was a realist masquerading as an idealist or an idealist masquerading as a realist , as people always wondered about bobby kennedy and john kennedy in that way .
he actually crosses so far into this realm of talking to evil and trying to convince evil that it doesn 't need to prevail that he earns the nickname -- not sergio but serbio while he 's living in the balkans and conducting these kinds of negotiations .
maybe you stay reticent . maybe you try to charm president bush -- and that 's what he did . and in so doing he earned himself , unfortunately , his final and tragic appointment to iraq -- the one that resulted in his death .
don 't you see it 's unacceptable what you 're doing ?
it 's incredibly important , those people would no longer be alive if the united states , for instance , hadn 't spent that money in darfur , but it 's not a way to live .
so will evil prevail ? is that the question ?
all across the boreal , it 's home for a huge incredible range of indigenous peoples , and a rich and varied culture .
that would be a huge , vast metropolitan area , probably much larger than the city of victoria .
that 's two-thirds the size of the entire island of manhattan .
so what we 're doing is , we 're taking the most concentrated greenhouse gas sink , twice as much greenhouse gases are sequestered in the boreal per acre than the tropical rainforests .
and the great bear rainforest is generally considered to be the largest coastal temperate rainforest ecosystem in the world .
it could destroy the athabasca delta , the largest and possibly greatest freshwater delta in the planet .
but people lie every day .
sorry . you lose .
what is moral and immoral in trying to change people 's behaviors by using technology and using design ?
but it turns out , if you look into research on people 's mindset , that caring about outcomes , caring about public recognition , caring about these kinds of public tokens of recognition is not necessarily very helpful for your long-term psychological well-being .
and we can question these values .
and that is an idea that , i think , that paul richard buchanan nicely put in a recent essay where he said , " products are vivid arguments about how we should live our lives . "
and even something as innocuous as a single design chair -- like this one by arne jacobsen -- is a persuasive technology .
because ultimately how can you ask yourselves and how can you find an answer on what vision of the good life you want to convey and create with your designs without asking the question , what vision of the good life do you yourself want to live ?
yeah , it 's just a fluke . it 's a lancet fluke .
they 're infectious .
unmistakable .
i mean , a virus is -- you know , it 's stuff ! what 's a meme made of ? "
but in fact that 's not why they went extinct .
yesterday , a number of people -- nicholas negroponte and others -- spoke about all the wonderful things that are happening when our ideas get spread out , thanks to all the new technology all over the world .
this is not the place for hate and anger .
in 1994 , when i was a curator at the whitney museum , i made an exhibition called black male .
now , what does this mean to some of you ?
where can a museum exist as the place for us all to have this conversation ?
that 's what makes me get up every day and want to think about this generation of black artists and artists around the world .
and computation , storage and communications capacity are in the hands of practically every connected person -- and these are the basic physical capital means necessary for producing information , knowledge and culture , in the hands of something like 600 million to a billion people around the planet .
this is not only outside of businesses . when you think of what is the critical innovation of google , the critical innovation is outsourcing the one most important thing -- the decision about what 's relevant -- to the community of the web as a whole , doing whatever they want to do : so , page rank .
it 's that it 's the first time that it 's having major economic impact .
as you see a new set of social relations and behaviors emerging , you have new opportunities . some of them are toolmakers .
and like all good soaps , it jumps 20 years when the audience interest changes .
but there is one other reason why india fell in love with cricket , which was , all you needed was a plank of wood and a rubber ball , and any number of people could play it anywhere .
and pepsi was this big revolution , because they started taking cricket all over .
but what a game we had , m. s. dhoni got it right in the air , but misbah-ul-haq , what a player .
because cricket , for a long time in india was always organized .
all along , if you wanted a young cricketer , you picked him up from the bylanes of your own little locality , your own city , and you were very proud of the system that produced those cricketers .
we started getting song and dance in indian cricket .
and so the auction that followed literally had people saying , " bang ! so many million dollars for so-and-so player . "
we 'd also made cricket the only sport in india , which is a pity , but in india every other sport pushes cricket to become big , which is a bit of a tragedy of our times .
as we heard from dr. insel this morning , psychiatric disorders like autism , depression and schizophrenia take a terrible toll on human suffering .
so if we ever really want to understand the biological basis of psychiatric disorders , we need to pinpoint these locations in the brain where these chemicals act .
what can we do ? it 's not so easy .
that 's right -- flies , like people , have dopamine , and it acts on their brains and on their synapses through the same dopamine receptor molecules that you and i have .
the kids can 't sit still long enough to focus , so they don 't learn .
and so thinking back , i was thinking those of us in silicon valley were really focused on products or objects -- certainly technological objects .
and it 's a much better way to see .
and a group at itch , which is now part of ideo , designed this interactive wall that 's about four stories tall .
you feel so trapped , when someone kind of leans over and you 're sort of held captive there for a minute .
and we 're announcing a new product here tonight , which is the first time this has ever been shown in public .
so he decided to start manufacturing products in kenya with kenyan manufacturers -- designed by people like us , but taken there .
i 'm a storyteller . i want to convey something that is truer than truth about our common humanity .
a speck of snow , an inch of ice , the force of the wind , can determine the result of a race or a game .
i looked like a refrigerator .
i want to carry in my heart forever the key word of the olympics -- passion .
i was born in ancient times , at the end of the world , in a patriarchal catholic and conservative family .
outside , there is a line of women who have waited several hours to be treated .
it is a fact that giving women education , work , the ability to control their own income , inherit and own property , benefits the society .
no museum or gallery in the united states , except for the new york gallery that carries botero 's work , has dared to show the paintings because the theme is the abu ghraib prison .
why not ? it is possible . look around in this room -- all this knowledge , energy , talent and technology .
early embryo yolk sack still feeding baby .
then you start to take a look at adult life .
got to do what i can to make sure i look good , and the reason i have to look real good , well , to tell you the truth , man , i don 't know why . guess it makes me feel special inside .
took off fast , didn 't get far . i fired , ' pow ! ' fool fell between two parked cars .
now i could have quit . i should have quit .
sanford meisner was my uncle artie yelling silently to himself , " something 's always wrong when nothing 's always right . "
i don 't need to improve any more . "
and he put me on anti-depressants .
it 's a continuous journey .
only , i believe , for a lack of imagination .
the gps dot will do the same for our possessions .
in fact , as i looked into her case , i discovered to my surprise that it 's not clearly illegal for you or me to put a tracking device on someone else 's car .
our modern society has a special relationship with gps .
they have no encryption . they have no authentication .
i saw the gps-derived timing of the new york stock exchange being manipulated by hackers .
a fact came out of mit , couple of years ago . ken hale , who 's a linguist , said that of the 6,000 languages spoken on earth right now , 3,000 aren 't spoken by the children .
and it really impressed me -- i met him two weeks after he got out of prison -- that he went through that experience , and ended up with the demeanor that he had .
and i usually hand out polaroids when i do these , because i 'm setting up lights , and checking my lights , and when i showed her her polaroid , she screamed and ran into her tent .
and the knowledge that these people have about the natural environment is incredible .
and he 's up in the mountains , right on the border with afghanistan .
so our dream is to bring teenagers together , so they 'll have a community service experience as well as a cross-cultural experience , as they teach kids in these areas and help them build their communication infrastructure .
this is an old mayan funeral chant that he got from his grandfather .
because half the world 's population runs the risk of contracting a killer disease like malaria through a simple mosquito bite .
it 's about man 's best friend . it 's about dogs .
man 's best friend in the fight against malaria .
now — — maastricht , be prepared .
and when most of us get asked , " where were you september 12th ? "
i 'm going to pass this onto the tampa office . they 're the ones who initiated this .
so at the end of six months of this and nine consecutive polygraphs , they said , " hey , everything 's fine . "
with pictures , with travel tips .
these images are shot really anonymously to the point where it could be anyone .
sometimes there 's a lot of information .
so again , you have to do some detective work here .
so what do you do when everything is out there ?
no one 's really going to bother you . "
he : almost none .
when we talk about power transition , we often talk about the rise of asia .
the state still matters .
but we need a new narrative if we 're to understand power in the 21st century .
by 2027 .
so these simple projections of the goldman sachs type are not telling us what we need to know about power transition .
we don 't have to fear the rise of china or the return of asia .
now i don 't mean to be pollyannaish about this .
nasa uses this extreme environment to train astronauts and aquanauts , and last year , they invited us along for the ride .
and we were pretty much just overwhelmed with interest from people who wanted a kit that they could build this open rov themselves .
thank you .
there 's not one week that goes without some major headlines in the media about whether video games are good or bad for you , right ? you 're all bombarded with that .
another saying that i 'm sure you have all heard around : video games lead to attention problems and greater distractability .
you 're going to see yellow happy faces and a few sad blue faces . these are children in the schoolyard in geneva during a recess during the winter . most kids are happy . it 's actually recess .
now , we can measure that kind of skills in the lab .
now in a sense , when we think about the effect of video games on the brain , it 's very similar to the effect of wine on the health .
they do distributed practice , so little shots of 40 minutes several days over a period of two weeks .
e : woo .
e : [ laser noise ] sw : yeah , yeah . that was pretty funny , einstein .
i know , you need to get rid of that seed first . can you sing ?
and we didn 't think he 'd be in town then , so einstein wanted to do something special for him .
e : ooh , ooh , ooh . aah , aah , aah .
e : i 'm special .
and the fourth thing , which i believe is most important , is " the ideas that we need to anticipate . "
therefore india is at a critical point where either it can leverage its demographic dividend or it can lead to a demographic disaster .
and then i think the other point is that indians today are far more comfortable with globalization .
so i believe primary education is an idea which is arrived but not yet implemented .
increasingly now the policies of taxation and infrastructure and all that , are moving towards creating india as a single market .
it 's very difficult to start a private university .
india is already at two tons per year .
that is why i think all of you should be equally concerned with it as i am .
before , i was an architect , and my grandmother asked me once , " what are you doing for a living ? "
and music has a rhythm , has ups and downs .
so first you ask a big question : why we do it ? what is the goal ?
i was born and raised in north korea .
but that is no way to survive .
chinese soldiers will catch and send back north koreans , where they face severe punishment .
so in america , it was kind of ridiculous that they said i should go to high school .
hope brought me to america .
jk : okay , i 'm not going to make it any longer in korean because i don 't think i can make it without tearing up .
we call ourselves the sleepy man banjo boys .
and so students like myself with nothing to do , we would learn how to program it .
it was around this time we went from 1k to 16k , which was quite the leap .
43 percent of gamers are female .
this market is now estimated at over 800 million dollars annually .
and i 'm going to show you up to maybe 2007 .
i 'm a video game addict and this is my story .
i know i can .
these are all troubles outside of myself .
imagine a game that teaches us to respect each other , or helps us to understand the problems we 're all facing in the real world .
they 're going to do it their way , using the tools that we 've created .
and as the student video showed , we can impact and move .
she was mesmerized .
and sometimes they also have to bring water from far away to do the laundry at home , or they have to bring the laundry away to a stream far off .
half of the energy is used by one seventh of the world 's population .
and they 'll get a two-child family without a stop in population growth .
she said , " now hans , we have loaded the laundry .
in addition to that , it harbors a lot of the biodiversity on earth , and much of it we don 't know about .
there are actually four to five new species described everyday for the oceans .
and so these are the sorts of extrapolations that we have of what sort of loss we 've had relative to pre-human impacts on the ocean .
that 's the sort of technology that 's available today that really wasn 't available even a decade ago .
and so there 's a barcode on that product that tells the computer exactly what the product is .
now there are a group of scientists living in texas , working in the gulf of mexico who decided really as a labor of love to pull together all the knowledge they could about biodiversity in the gulf of mexico .
now this guy , this bigfin squid , is seven meters in length .
and so there were new species that were found that live inside ice and help to support an ice-based food web .
so we still have quite a lot of work to do in terms of unknowns .
ocean acidification is a really big issue that people are concerned with , as well as ocean warming , and the effects they 're going to have on coral reefs .
they proceed to tell me a story which comes down to basically the following . we have used such advanced technologies now and made them available in the most remote places that we put soldiers : hills of afghanistan , iraq ...
i told them they 're nuts .
we sort of agreed to disagree .
and just as in the spirit of first , gracious professionalism , they are quite proud of this , so they decide to share a drink .
they were sitting at a table . they were brought together for us .
and then the meeting ended . we said goodbye to all these guys .
he 's got no legs .
this is not a happy thing . look , if this happens to you , i can give you ... this stuff is still not as good at the original equipment . "
what do we need to do ? " there 's very polarized answers to that question too , and i don 't have any answers to that .
and it used to be , back in the ' 50s , a very slim pamphlet .
and he said , " we 're going to introduce you to tony . "
and they were quite overweight and wearing sweatpants and quite docile looking .
and i said , " where 'd you get that from ? "
so i tend to stay in my room a lot because i find them quite frightening .
so i did .
he would come into failing businesses and close down 30 percent of the workforce , just turn american towns into ghost towns .
it 's like star trek . you 're going where no man has gone before . "
so whenever he said anything to me that just seemed kind of non-psychopathic , i thought to myself , well i 'm not going to put that in my book .
so i said okay .
because you shouldn 't define people by their maddest edges .
for , in weather , we 're not only dealing with forces of a far greater variety than even the atomic physicist encounters , but with life itself .
so humans are turning more towards animal consumption .
for some , it will lead to anger , religious and sectarian violence and terrorism .
this is the difficulty that one country faces .
last year , there were only 2,000 cases in the world .
and now 4,000 churches have joined the environmental movement .
we visited every house in india , searching for smallpox -- 120 million houses , once every month , for nearly two years .
the microbes in your mouth can freshen your breath , or not , and the key thing is that our personal ecosystems interact with ecosystems on everything we touch .
i told tim , " if you could just see the microbes , it 's kind of like being in costa rica . kind of . "
when he met me and realized that it was possible for him to study in a quantitative way how his design choices impacted the ecology and biology of this building , he got really excited , because it added a new dimension to what he did .
you will understand nothing with my type of english .
i think , " what will be the effect of the brush in the mouth ? "
at the end , finally , that succeeds , and life appears .
because that is our intelligence of mutation and things like that .
from this to here , that , it 's genius .
from far , this line looks very smooth , like that .
that 's why today i 'm so ashamed to make this job .
the only rule is , we have not to have any idea about the next story .
even just this one second allows me to remember everything else i did that one day .
now one of the things that i do is i don 't use any filters , i don 't use anything to -- i try to capture the moment as much as possible as the way that i saw it with my own eyes .
the age of the universe , between now and the big bang , is a hundred billion in dog years .
in particular , things were a lot denser .
the reason why entropy increases is simply because there are many more ways to be high entropy than to be low entropy .
so that 's our job .
einstein was fond of this idea .
it 's very , very unlikely .
now your homework assignment is to really think about this , to contemplate what it means .
the universe is expanding for the last 10 billion years or so .
more homework assignment for you .
thank you .
or , you take this particular un-retouched photograph . now , interestingly enough , i get a lot of emails from people who say , " is there any perceptual difference between males and females ? "
so , we 've got a picture , i think ? where is this ?
and you made it out of what ?
so what did they make of -- that you were 14 , 15 at the time -- what did they make of this ? they were impressed ?
for students , it 's quite an experience , but for a school , it could be very difficult or expensive to maintain .
so if i want to see the back side , i can flip and see from behind .
you can see the atrium and the ventricles , how blood flows to our arteries and veins .
what i and my colleagues did was put 32 people , who were madly in love , into a functional mri brain scanner .
he became hooked on a sleeping mat , probably because of elevated activity of dopamine in his brain , just like with you and me .
but my most important question was always the same .
and in fact , i think it 's more powerful than the sex drive .
the first is women working , moving into the workforce .
i generally give a whole lecture on the impact of women on the business community .
in fact , solzhenitsyn once said , " to have a great writer is to have another government . "
" oh , well -- men are more adulterous ! "
and as it turns out , the older you get , the less likely you are to divorce .
i think the happiness we find , we make .
and when you kill orgasm , you kill that flood of drugs associated with attachment .
and that 's what i 'm now contributing to this .
thank you .
they only need 12 days from the moment they 're born until they 're on their own .
but the truth is we 're way too efficient at catching them , and their stocks have collapsed worldwide .
and with its huge pectoral fins and eyes still very visible , it struck me as sort of a crucifixion , if you will .
because this is a pelagic animal and it lives out in the deeper water , and because we weren 't working on the bottom , i brought along a shark cage here , and my friend , shark biologist wes pratt is inside the cage .
only one in a thousand leatherback hatchlings will reach maturity .
and the other problem is they get hit by ships .
and that 's because the urchins eat kelp .
so i use sculpture and music to make it , not just visible , but also tactile and audible .
so all the way around , you have a 24-hour timeline .
thank you .
in october of 1903 , the prevailing opinion of expert aerodynamicists was that maybe in 10 million years we could build an aircraft that would fly .
at mach 20 , we can fly from new york to long beach in 11 minutes and 20 seconds .
and while there 's no substitute for speed , maneuverability is a very close second .
we cannot both fear failure and make amazing new things -- like a robot with the stability of a dog on rough terrain , or maybe even ice ; a robot that can run like a cheetah , or climb stairs like a human with the occasional clumsiness of a human .
experiments suggest that lightning could be the next gps .
it allows us to contribute and to be heard as individuals .
now i want to say , this is not easy .
and remember , be nice to nerds .
but not necessarily just a camera ?
that 's what we do .
my archive : 175 films , my 16-millimeter negative , all my books , my dad 's books , my photographs .
that 's me at my desk .
that 's my father 's letter to me , telling me to marry the woman i first married when i was 20 .
they are cells in dishes and animal testing .
and at the wyss institute , we 've done just that .
now the chip is really beautiful , but what can we do with it ?
when they get damaged , say , by cigarette smoke for example , they don 't work properly , and they can 't clear that mucus out .
does it get cleared by the liver ?
we 're really seeing something quite incredible at the wyss institute .
personalized medicine . thank you .
but we hold them in san francisco -- -- and in new york .
you know what those are , right ?
they 're a bit subversive in what they do .
he 's just a kid that grew up playing with tools instead of toys .
it 's a micro-controller .
and they do interesting things .
this is very strange for me , because i 'm not used to doing this : i usually stand on the other side of the light , and now i 'm feeling the pressure i put other people into . and it 's hard ...
nigeria .
marcus : it feeds my mind and my soul .
boy : see man , you 're just taking the piss out of me now .
did you ever move your fuckin ' ass from hollywood to go and film something real ?
there 's a young director , hollywood director , with his friends -- fellow filmmakers -- talking about what cinema means .
i don 't remember how we got there .
mariam is pregnant .
state your name and age for the commission .
no .
that was a very moving piece .
you could look at nature as being like a catalog of products , and all of those have benefited from a 3.8-billion-year research and development period .
and at the end of the project we worked out that the weight of that superstructure was actually less than the weight of the air inside the building .
graham wiles has continued to add more and more elements to this , turning waste streams into schemes that create value .
and this animation , this shows photosynthetic activity over the course of a number of years , and what you can see is that the boundaries of those deserts shift quite a lot , and that raises the question of whether we can intervene at the boundary conditions to halt , or maybe even reverse , desertification .
so it was like a green inkblot spreading out from the building turning barren land back into biologically productive land -- and in that sense , going beyond sustainable design to achieve restorative design .
you think , " what can i add to the system to create more value ? "
but perhaps more than anything , what this thinking provides is a really positive way of talking about sustainable design .
i moved out of the house , i got a job , i found a girl , i settled down -- and i realize it sounds like a bad sitcom or a cat stevens ' song -- but life was pretty good .
i spoke to him on the phone at 10 : 30 p.m.
and the surprise and just the amazement of that was only overshadowed by my return to toronto , when , in my inbox , 10 literary agents were waiting for me to talk about putting this into a book .
i love hanging out with three year-olds .
these were four guys on the l.a. rams in the 1960s you did not want to go up against .
i don 't know , because i never did it , but i would imagine that it would take a great attitude .
they 've got an apple here from south africa .
you can go to a concert and hear guitars jamming .
this was part of a challenge i did to take a picture every day for a month .
there 's nothing wrong with big , crazy challenges .
it 's downtowns becoming ghost towns .
so the public school students are about 86 percent african-american .
but this is our front porch . we live there .
and so this played out for us in a couple different ways .
it 's a systems-level look at how education is administered and what is being offered and to whom .
so we thought , what if you could bring back shop class , but this time orient the projects around things that the community needed , and to infuse shop class with a more critical and creative-design-thinking studio process .
he is 16 years old , loves hunting and fishing and being outside and doing anything with his hands , and so for him , studio h means that he can stay interested in his education through that hands-on engagement .
because you may notice that what 's actually happening is that the egg is unscrambling itself .
and in this way , complexity builds stage by stage .
and at first , it 's just a blur , but very quickly distinct things begin to appear in that blur .
we have our first stars .
what are the goldilocks conditions ?
and dna , of course , is the beautiful molecule that contains that information .
terrible news for the dinosaurs , but great news for our mammalian ancestors , who flourished in the niches left empty by the dinosaurs .
each migration involved learning -- learning new ways of exploiting the environment , new ways of dealing with their surroundings .
we 're burning fossil fuels at such a rate that we seem to be undermining the goldilocks conditions that made it possible for human civilizations to flourish over the last 10,000 years .
he hides his sensitivities and romantic side , because in russia , among guys , that 's not cool to be romantic , but it 's cool to be surrounded with women and look like an aggressive hulk .
we 're doing changing media .
this is a little spot that we filmed there that 's to be displayed on the large jumbotrons in singapore .
great person .
what it was , was the 20th anniversary of the siege , the beginning of the siege of sarajevo , and i don 't like the word " anniversary , " because it sounds like a party , and this was not a party .
you 're not allowed to identify anyone by ethnicity , which is , of course , what started the slaughter in the first place .
i 'm not a u.n. conflict resolution person .
now bring it out , bring it out . anybody else ?
audience : 25 .
thank you very much .
audience : oh , 722 .
yes .
good . then i shall attempt the impossible -- or at least the improbable .
for my next number -- while i mentally recharge my batteries , i have one more question for the audience .
february what ? audience : sixth .
audience : april . april what ?
now , i have to apologize to our magician friend lennart green .
this is a phonetic code , a mnemonic device that i use , that allows me to convert numbers into words .
now , one thing about being a twin is that it makes you an expert at spotting favoritism .
and yet , even though there are scientifically proven techniques we could use to treat these kinds of psychological injuries , we don 't .
i knew he would call in the morning , but that night was one of the saddest and longest nights of my life .
it even suppress the functioning of your immune system , making you vulnerable to all kinds of illnesses and diseases .
because if your mind tries to convince you you 're incapable of something and you believe it , then like those two toddlers , you 'll begin to feel helpless and you 'll stop trying too soon , or you won 't even try at all .
and you have to break this kind of negative cycle before it begins .
you wouldn 't get a cut on your arm and decide , " oh , i know !
and i couldn 't stop thinking about what he was going through .
if they were happier and more fulfilled ?
us humans , of course , we don 't move around marking our territory by scent , like dogs .
what 's more , we abstract , repeat patterns , and recognize them .
now we 've reached the subject of public transport , and public transport here in dublin is a somewhat touchy subject .
so i teamed up with a gentleman called james leahy , a civil engineer and a recent master 's graduate of the sustainable development program at dit , and together we drafted this simplified model network which i could then go ahead and visualize .
so for a successful public transport map , we should not stick to accurate representation , but design them in the way our brains work .
the american way , to quote burger king , is to " have it your way , " because , as starbucks says , " happiness is in your choices . "
when the second group of children came in , they were brought to the same room , shown the same anagrams , but this time miss smith told them which anagrams to do and which markers to write their answers with .
it leaves little room for interdependence or an acknowledgment of individual fallibility .
for modern americans who are exposed to more options and more ads associated with options than anyone else in the world , choice is just as much about who they are as it is about what the product is .
instead of making better choices , we become overwhelmed by choice , sometimes even afraid of it .
what do any parent do ?
we interpret what we see , select the most workable of the multiple choices .
it brings us that much closer to realizing the full potential of choice , to inspiring the hope and achieving the freedom that choice promises but doesn 't always deliver .
and so i asked them , " well , how do i tell them apart ?
anyway , the american cities : lots of roads dispersed over large areas , almost no public transportation .
now , stockholm is a medium-sized city , roughly two million people , but stockholm also has lots of water and lots of water means lots of bridges -- narrow bridges , old bridges -- which means lots of road congestion .
i mean , this was a really fun experiment to start with , and we actually got to do it twice .
and why is that ? it 's because that travel patterns are much less stable than you might think .
it 's about perfecting something old , and bringing something old into the 21st century .
you can run these off -- they 're really hungry , they really like down-blended weapons pits , so that 's highly enriched uranium and weapons-grade plutonium that 's been down-blended .
and the problem with a traditional nuclear power plant like this is , you 've got these rods that are clad in zirconium , and inside them are uranium dioxide fuel pellets .
and it 's an amazing technology because not only does it combat climate change , but it 's an innovation .
i think that i 've designed this reactor here that can be an innovative source of energy , provide power for all kinds of neat scientific applications , and i 'm really prepared to do this .
in 1995 , illegal drugs were a $ 400 billion business , representing eight percent of world trade , roughly the same as gas and oil .
especially expressions of contempt or disgust , well you really need a lot of positives to upset that .
so when people 's symptoms go away , they tend to recur , because there isn 't a sense of the other half -- of what pleasure , happiness , compassion , gratitude , what are the positive emotions .
let 's just go into the brain for a moment , and see where does happiness arise from in evolution .
it 's also crinkling the outer corner of the eye , the orbicularis oculi .
these are not the periods when you feel happiest .
and that 's clearly the way for us to create many more niches of status so that people don 't have to be lower on the status hierarchy as they are in the animal world .
they went from attractiveness and happiness and wealth and self-control to generosity and forgiveness .
so i picked up my banjo and i nervously played four songs that i actually knew with them .
and i tell you what , it like everybody 's got a story .
but at the other hand , a couple of years ago i gave up all of my possessions , sold all my technology -- except for a bicycle -- and rode across 3,000 miles on the u.s. back roads under the power of my one body , fuelled mostly by twinkies and junk food .
what are its tendencies over time ? one way to think about this is thinking about biological organisms , which we 've heard a lot about .
these are hacks , and if we looked at the general shape of the approaches to hacking life there are , current consensus , six kingdoms . six different broad approaches : the plants , the animals , the fungi , the protests -- the little things -- the bacteria and the archaea bacteria . the archaeas .
one of the things we see about life is that it moves from the inner to increasing sociability . and by that it means that there is more and more of life whose entire environment is other life .
i suggest that , in fact , technology is the seventh kingdom of life .
and not antiques . i want to know how many of these things are still in production .
so if you have life hacking -- life means hacking , the game of survival -- then evolution is a way to extend the game by changing the rules of the game .
somewhere , today , there are millions of young children being born whose technology of self-expression has not yet been invented .
thank you .
thank you .
i posed a problem in front of them , which was to put on an election forum for their own community .
we could walk there . we didn 't even have to pay for the buses .
that is the absolute wrong thing to ask , to tell kids to never be wrong .
and there 's some ... " and they went through all that we processed out loud .
we also , like a lot of companies , create a product that 's based on technology trends .
the first is the critical price .
netflix was right -- the netflix model could capitalize on the dvd in a way that the video-rental stores couldn 't .
here 's another technology that 's approaching a critical price .
at two percent , you start seeing them on the roads everywhere .
you know , there could be a film 's [ unclear ] there , but it 's basically , every song ever made could be stored on 400 dollars worth of storage by 2008 . it takes that entire element , the physical element , of songs off the table .
well let me tell you , in terms of changing the world there has been a lot of competition this year , because the arab spring is still spreading , the eurozone has collapsed ... what else ?
and they pasted [ over ] every single portrait of the dictator [ with ] their own photos .
people , energy , make the glue , organize the team .
this is the biggest global art participatory project that 's going on .
but if you wanted to really do research , what do you have to do ?
it 's still running at the human equivalent of 300 miles per hour .
we 've also described another species of bipedal octopus .
really simple , but beautiful .
do we really understand that principle of tuning ? the answer is , yes !
we can actually model that behavior better as a fluid , if you look at it .
let 's look at that ant .
if we slow it down , they attach their feet at eight milliseconds , and detach them in 16 milliseconds .
but it makes an incredible band-aid .
and that 's exactly what he 's done .
i became an inventor by accident .
you turn on the loudspeaker , and after almost 80 years of having those gadgets , the sound just kind of goes where it wants .
i just happened to get my education in a little different way .
we 're also working on noise canceling things like snoring , noise from automobiles .
an effect happens in the air , it 's a corrupting effect of the sound -- the ultrasound in this case -- that 's emitted , but it 's so predictable that you can produce very precise audio out of that effect .
i 'm serious . and they have these infrared devices that can look at their countenance , and see a fraction of a degree kelvin in temperature shift from 100 yards away when they play this thing .
big mistake : it just sold for 80 million dollars two years ago .
this question : " how do i deal with a bully without becoming a thug in return ? "
and only very rarely in very few cases does it work to use more violence .
so that 's what the mastery of fear can do -- not only faced with machine guns , but if you meet a knife fight in the street .
wherever there is injustice there 's anger .
they know best what to do .
you don 't believe me ?
thank you .
and what i now present to you is an excerpt from a book in progress .
these are inuit children cutting whale blubber .
so these black boxes that we live with and take for granted are actually complex things made by other people and you can understand them .
i think that 's it . that 's number five and a half . ok .
it 's going to be a cradle-to-cradle scream bag , of course .
and that 's why i went out and i picked up a best-selling business book .
it needs to be flat , so it 's transportable .
day two .
so , einstein -- einstein , tell me -- what 's your favorite song ?
so we started with babel fish . we put in global warming .
so we 're going to build this new building on stilts .
can we cue the music please ?
so i thought i 'd start off by just telling you a little bit about myself and why i lead this schizophrenic life .
and he wasn 't doing that . he was scribbling with chalk on the pavement .
and apart from a few very important loose ends , which you 've heard about here -- like dark energy and dark matter -- this equation describes , seems to describe everything about the universe and what 's in it .
the gap is very tiny , and i 've blown it up so you can see it .
well , making and testing models of the universe is , for me , the best way i have of enjoying and appreciating the universe .
ok , currently there are 45,000 people a month dying in the congo , as a consequence of the war there over coltan and diamonds and other things .
they said , " go and do it , and we 'll come and lecture . "
no droning on at the chalkboard .
and we set ourselves a goal of turning the continent green .
and he 's shown here with his favorite high school teacher .
our ted dream is that the next einstein will be african .
at every site there will be huge challenges .
i consider myself among the majority who look at windmills and feel they 're a beautiful addition to the landscape .
and so you can start reading on your ipad in your living room and then pick up where you left off on the iphone .
this is a picornavirus .
ok , i make little robots in lab to make these chips , and i 'm really big on disseminating technology .
that 's the scourge of daycare centers everywhere -- it 's like boogeremia , basically .
it could have lots of bacteria , it could have more than one virus , and it certainly has host genetic material .
here are two individuals represented by their anonymous id codes .
and this is what this looks like .
switch antibiotics : so they switched to another antibiotic , tamiflu .
there 's almost no epidemiology or studies on it .
but that doesn 't tell us too much , so we actually clone the whole thing .
this is a collaboration between myself and don .
now , related to this is another key issue , which is needlestick injuries .
so firstly , the projections on the nanopatch breach through the tough outer layer and the vaccine is very quickly released -- within less than a minute , in fact .
it 's off the grid entirely .
so the red line is mostly below that curve and indeed there 's only one point that is achieved with the needle that 's protective , and that 's with a high dose of 6,000 nanograms .
the who estimates that within africa , up to half the vaccines used there are considered to not be working properly because at some point the cold chain has fallen over .
it 's challenging , but there 's nothing else in the world i 'd rather be doing .
the best way to learn about anything is through stories , and so i want to tell you a story about work and play and about four aspects of life that we need to embrace in order for our own creativity to flourish .
it 's from 1656 , and it 's called " las meninas , " and it 's the picture of a little princess and her ladies-in-waiting , and if you look over that little blonde princess 's shoulder , you 'll see a mirror , and reflected in it are her parents , the king and queen of spain , who would be standing where you might stand to look at the picture .
joel meyerowitz : and like all the other passersby , i stood outside the chain link fence on chambers and greenwich , and all i could see was the smoke and a little bit of rubble , and i raised my camera to take a peek , just to see if there was something to see , and some cop , a lady cop , hit me on my shoulder , and said , " hey , no pictures ! "
when i saw joel meyerowitz recently , i told him how much i admired his passionate obstinacy , his determination to push through all the bureaucratic red tape to get to work , and he laughed , and he said , " i 'm stubborn , but i think what 's more important is my passionate optimism . "
they were press pieces and they were full of outrage , they were full of speculation , they were anecdotal -- no solid information .
it 's a pretty harrowing linkage between what 's happening to our environment and what 's happening to our human rights .
i knew i had to do anything i could to earn some money to support the people i care about . "
we 're not about to run out of people . no other commodity has that .
you buy them cheaply , you use them , you crumple them up , and then when you 're done with them you just throw them away .
and it can be done .
they take their kids out of the workplace , they build a school , they say , " we 're going to have stuff we 've never had before like three squares , medicine when we 're sick , clothing when we 're cold . "
if we don 't take action , we just leave ourselves open to have someone else jerk the strings that tie us to slavery in the products we buy , and in our government policies .
now that is foreplay .
and they didn 't know that .
and the context is the earth -- the same context that we 're trying to solve our problems in .
and its shape is what gives it the function of being able to tumble through air so easily . look at that shape .
a guy named jeff brinker has found a way to have a self-assembling coding process .
solar transformations : the most exciting one .
what if we were to say , no more hard rock mining ?
but what i am going to do is tell you that the most important thing , besides all of these adaptations , is the fact that these organisms have figured out a way to do the amazing things they do while taking care of the place that 's going to take care of their offspring .
we should be growing fertility . and , oh yes -- we get food , too .
in the newspaper it said " it was all part of a normal process . "
wouldn 't it be really great if the window could flick back the heat into the room if we needed it or flick it away before it came in ?
transparency is key .
and if i don 't need it , i can convert it back up on the window to energy , light , and beam it , line of site , to your place .
we can do better than this .
yes , i have a team .
it just simply can 't be done , and bonnie said to me , " but if you 're going to take the journey , i 'm going to see you through to the end of it , so i 'll be there . "
and the hypothermia sets in .
the epic journey is going to be over .
the second is , " you can chase your dreams at any age ; you 're never too old . "
find a way !
women love to talk about their vaginas -- they do .
and so i said to a friend casually , " well , what do you think about your vagina ? "
what women lined up to tell me was how they were raped , and how they were battered , and how they were beaten , and how they were gang-raped in parking lots , and how they were incested by their uncles .
i have seen terrible , terrible , terrible violence .
and at that time we did this extraordinary v-day at madison square garden where we sold out the entire testosterone-filled dome , 18,000 people standing up to say " yes " to vaginas , which was really a pretty incredible transformation .
and she said , " well , if you got me a jeep , i could get around a lot faster . "
and i feel that knowledge and that journey has been an extraordinary privilege , and i feel really blessed to have been here today to communicate that to you .
and apparently , he disobeyed god , and that 's the ultimate disobedience to authority .
i had access to him . i could study him , have him come to my home , get to know him , do psychological analysis to see , was he a good apple or bad apple .
in any event , here 's former secretary of defense rumsfeld .
and it 's a dynamic interplay .
we want men between 20 and 50 . "
you should notice here , when it gets up to 375 , it says , " danger . severe shock . "
so this study , which i did with my graduate students , especially craig haney -- we also began work with an ad .
philip zimbardo : here are the prisoners who are going to be dehumanized .
the key is in the red zone .
if you give people power without oversight , it 's a prescription for abuse . they knew that , and let that happen .
they organize their whole life around this .
so the psychology of heroism is -- we 're going to end in a moment -- how do we encourage children in new hero courses , that i 'm working with matt langdon -- he has a hero workshop -- to develop this heroic imagination , this self-labeling , " i am a hero in waiting , " and teach them skills .
and so one day , you will be in a new situation .
the way we 're going to do this is fly him in and drop him off .
i 'm here to talk about what we should do .
android .
but how do we figure out what 's right and wrong ?
it 's kind of convincing when he talks and when she talks too .
that 's a stunning vision .
the three people who voted for mill before are familiar with this .
he has autonomy .
i know ; i spent a lot of my career in artificial intelligence , trying to build machines that could do some of this thinking for us , that could give us answers .
it is so important we are going to spend 30 seconds of valuable tedtalk time doing nothing but thinking about this .
and you 're telling him what we 're talking about , about our whole data revolution and all this -- maybe even hum a few bars of our theme music .
thank you . thank you very much .
there 's lots of grand openings .
what 's happening now , in this field called biomimicry , is that people are beginning to remember that organisms , other organisms , the rest of the natural world , are doing things very similar to what we need to do .
we 're not the first ones to have to protect ourselves from some bacteria .
10 times better than our fog-catching nets .
and it 's in every cell .
nanotechnology , nanoparticles , you hear a lot of worry about this .
these are some questions that we 've yet to ask .
which is to create conditions conducive to life .
bear in mind this was an ultrasound , so it would have been moving images .
so i interviewed her in oakland , in a sushi restaurant .
i said , " so , could you conceivably trigger an orgasm in a dead person ? "
and lo and behold , the hiccups went away .
this is the 1950s .
in denmark , the danish national committee for pig production found out that if you sexually stimulate a sow while you artificially inseminate her , you will see a six-percent increase in the farrowing rate , which is the number of piglets produced .
she said -- i have to read you what she said , because i love it .
and the woman would have sex with it .
so what 's image got do with it ?
when things were bad , we had porridge .
and i sat and listened to the headmistress talk to him , saying , you know , who do you think you are ?
you know , so money ran out .
but it 's damaging .
it only has five contributors .
i walked away from a job with one of the top firms in d.c. , covington and burling , six figures .
you 're not just going to be accountable out of the goodness of your heart .
it 's not that easy , you know ?
but , you know , let 's figure out what i need you to do , what i need to do to help you out . "
that you can grow up , you know , not so good circumstances , and you can move .
the spiral eddy that trails a paddle on a rafting trip .
and you might say , " surely , rueben , if you took even just the slightest step back , the cycles of hunger and eating , waking and sleeping , laughing and crying would emerge as pattern . "
and i happened to have a friend who was over , and he said , " why don 't you just wait . "
and as the dawn came up and he went to meet his destiny , he left this pile of papers on the table for the next generation .
he wrote , " the universe cannot be read until we have learnt the language and become familiar with the characters in which it is written .
recently i took my family -- we do these rather kind of nerdy mathematical trips , which my family love .
so , for example , the walls in the alhambra -- i can take all of these tiles , and fix them at the yellow place , rotate them by 90 degrees , put them all back down again and they fit perfectly down there .
it seems mad to talk about nothing .
and here we see galois starting to develop a language to see the substance of the things unseen , the sort of abstract idea of the symmetry underlying this physical object .
it 's as if it was reflected in the line through y.
but the shapes match up if i rotate by a sixth of a turn around the point where all the triangles meet .
and that 's where i work . i create mathematical objects , symmetrical objects , using galois ' language , in very high dimensional spaces .
great . excellent . that should get us going . all right .
g-h-e-z no , so2 has already been used , actually , in the mathematical language . so you can 't have that one .
but there is a glamour of industry .
glamour is a magic spell .
it puts you into this special , special world .
so as i say , in religious art , you know , god is not glamorous .
you know , when you get , actually to this town it has reality .
there are no cords .
and the way we deal with that is we displace them -- we put them into a golden world , an imagined world , an age of heroes , the world to come .
it was criticized for glamorizing violence , because , look -- sunglasses and those long coats , and , of course , they could walk up walls and do all these kinds of things that are impossible in the real world .
and that 's to take isaac mizrahi 's advice and confront the manipulation of it all , and sort of admit that manipulation is something that we enjoy , but also enjoy how it happens .
and they brought quite a bit of this stuff .
and eventually , our worst nightmare happened : they flooded the engine .
and you should be really glad we decided not to bring the camel .
when they 're in rut -- they 're similar to seals in the way , like , a seal has to open its nose to breathe .
i don 't know why that would be , but it works for them .
well -- and you 're glad i didn 't show you this .
the perfect desert machine .
able to pack up to 400 lbs .
this technology made a very important impact on us .
i would say , we should call ourselves coctivors -- from coquere , to cook .
i think the good news for me would be if we could go back and talk about the unleashing , the continuation of the unleashing of human potential .
and this is actually taste reward and energy .
this is what we are using . "
it senses it by chemical means and very importantly by mechanical means , because it has to move the food -- it has to mix all the various elements which we need for digestion .
the more usual case is overeating .
now if we could take this language -- and this is a language of structures -- and make it longer-lasting , that it can go through the passage of the intestine , it would generate stronger signals .
they play off each other in a wonderful way .
richard saul wurman : i remember hearing him talk at penn .
architect ? i 've heard about him ; he 's a top-ranking architect .
but he was also human .
and i 'm also trying to create a means in which to step outside our quotidian experience of time and to start to consider a deeper timescale .
these lichens grow only one centimeter every hundred years .
this is clonal colony of quaking aspen trees , living in utah , that is literally 80,000 years old .
and back to the yew here .
i spoke to a biologist at the kirstenbosch botanical garden in capetown to ask him where he thought this remarkable plant came from , and his thought was that if you travel around namibia , you see that there are a number of petrified forests , and the logs are all -- the logs are all giant coniferous trees , and yet there 's no sign of where they might have come from .
so , now i want to show what very well might be the oldest living thing on the planet .
in the last year ?
well , that 's what the producer says : it 's " improving the dough , of course . "
this actually also goes for wine as well as fruit juice .
it 's really a sort of magical moment .
now , lethally autonomous killer robots would take many forms -- flying , driving , or just lying in wait .
but time is a factor .
it could make military action a viable option not just for small nations , but criminal organizations , private enterprise , even powerful individuals .
and ideas achieving critical mass is what political activism in popular government is all about .
and civic leaders should deploy sensors and civic drones to detect rogue drones , and instead of sending killer drones of their own up to shoot them down , they should notify humans to their presence .
all of them , however , including myself , as we walk underneath those strange stone gargoyles just down the road , feel that we 've become less than the sum of our parts , feel as though we have become profoundly diminished .
what is wrong with the people that we have chosen ?
after i speak to you today , i 'm going on a radio program called " any questions , " and the thing you will have noticed about politicians on these kinds of radio programs is that they never , ever say that they don 't know the answer to a question . it doesn 't matter what it is .

in practice , the norden bombsight can drop a bomb into a pickle barrel at 20,000 ft . , but that 's under perfect conditions .
10 percent . 10 percent .
and after the war was over , there was an audit done -- as the army always does , the air force always does -- and they asked the question : how many scuds did we actually destroy ?
that is one of the most extraordinary records in the history of modern warfare .
back then , 15 years ago , we didn 't have the ability to look inside the living human brain and track development across the lifespan .
so in my lab , we 're interested in the social brain , that is the network of brain regions that we use to understand other people and to interact with other people .
they move the white truck instead of the blue truck .
so for example , take risk-taking . we know that adolescents have a tendency to take risks . they do .
you guys have very insecure computers , ok ?
it 's a machine about the size of a photocopier . and what happens is , they take your e-mail and every letter in your e-mail , they replace with 30-atom cluster -- one for each letter , a , t , c , and g in dna . they string them up in the right sequence , and then they send them back to you via fedex .

but when you 're in a hurry or stressed out , that triggers something called the inflammatory response , which is associated with everything from alzheimer 's disease to cardiovascular disease .
when it comes to longevity there is no short term fix in a pill or anything else .
you may just know more about everything than anyone .
so in one level it went from something like 13 dollars to 266 , literally in the space of four months , and then crashed and lost half of its value in six hours .
so if you think we 're starting to question and disrupt and interrogate what money means , what our relationship with it is , what defines money , then the ultimate extension of that is , is there a reason for the government to be in charge of money anymore ?
and what they 're saying , so some criminologists have looked at this and they 're saying , well , okay , tide as a product sells at a premium .
in africa , you know , airtime has become literally a currency in its own right .
corporations are filling gaps that governments can 't afford to fill .
this is me building a prototype for six hours straight .
and that 's called self-assembly , which is a process by which disordered parts build an ordered structure through only local interaction .
this is the polio virus .
this is another part , single strand , dipped in a bigger tank that self-folds into a cube , a three-dimensional structure , on its own .
so i would like to invite you from whatever industry you 're from to join us in reinventing and reimagining the world , how things come together from the nanoscale to the human scale , so that we can go from a world like this to a world that 's more like this .
my father also lived most of his adult life in east africa .
and he had nine days to make it .
i think it 's the most viable vehicle right now to pass information across a dedicated cable .
come on . don 't run away . come back . come back .
roboger animadu : in big countries , when they do the movies , they have all these things in place .
werner herzog , the german filmmaker said , " i need to make movies like you need oxygen . "
try to imagine a world where the only goal is food and a shelter , but no stories .
and i really hope that this will happen .
fs : oh , the format -- thank you for the question . yes , it 's vcds .
when i was a child , i started to explore motion .
i gave myself the problem .
the next piece i 'll show you is a much more conceptual thought , and it 's a little piece called " cory 's yellow chair . "
but when she suggested to be in the show , this piece came to mind .
when i moved to boston , i joined a group called the world sculpture racing society .
and that means the complete cycle of coming from inside , out to the physical , to someone perceiving it .
i mean , this is a very small sample ; you should not generalize from it .
whenever you go to a teacher and show them some technology , the teacher 's first reaction is , you cannot replace a teacher with a machine -- it 's impossible .
so it sort of raised more questions than it answered .
but let 's see , how do the children tackle the english language ?
i also had to check or invent an engineering design which would survive outdoors , and i was using regular , normal pcs , so i needed different climates , for which india is also great , because we have very cold , very hot , and so on .
and over 300 children will become computer literate and be able to do all of these things in six months with one computer .
i simply took those questions where i got 50 percent yeses and 50 percent noes -- so i was able to get a collection of 16 such statements .
we borrowed it . video conferencing . the personal computer itself .
what i thought we would do today a little bit is explore this idea of physical thinking , and we 're all experts in physical thinking .
and i 'm going to imagine this , you can do this too if you like , that i 'm going to just take the letter " t " and i 'm going to imagine it in mind , and i 'm going to place that outside in the real world . so i absolutely see a letter " t " in front of me .
so we 're starting to build a phrase .
just grab this arm .
yeah . just a little bit more , here we go , from that place .
just for a second , think about that word " ted " in front of you , so it 's in mind , and it 's there right in front of your mind .
so yeah , let 's clap -- yeah , let 's clap afterwards .
as a child , i would hate being made to wear the indian kurta pajama , because i didn 't think it was very cool .
it offends me .
he said , " yeah , you learned from a woman ? "
however , in the same survey , only four percent of employees agreed .
the ultimate empowerment of customers is to ask them not to buy .
that should make them more humble , more vulnerable and more human .
and as a woman who didn 't get married until i was a lot older -- and i 'm glad i waited -- -- and has no children , i look at these young people and i say , " your job is not to be perfect .
and when we think about legacy , i can think of no more powerful one , despite how short her life was .
and though she had been part of building a liberal party , a political party that was focused on diversity and tolerance , about three months before the genocide , she switched parties and joined the extremist party , hutu power , and she became the minister of justice under the genocide regime and was known for inciting men to kill faster and stop behaving like women .
and they wanted to celebrate what 's beautiful about kibera and mathare -- the photojournalists and the creatives , the graffiti artists , the teachers and the entrepreneurs .
for two years , he hardly made any money , a tiny stipend , but he apprenticed with this incredible housing developer named tasneem saddiqui .
and he tells this incredible story about working with a little six-year-old girl named ruby bridges , the first child to desegregate schools in the south -- in this case , new orleans .
and we need to have the humility to recognize that we cannot do it alone .
you all remember , dolly , it came from a single mammary cell .
so , he made a filtrate , he took this filter which was the liquid after he passed the tumor through a filter , and he injected it to another chicken , and he got another tumor .
so , we took the red cells -- you see the red cells are surrounded by blue , other cells that squeeze them , and behind it is material that people thought was mainly inert , and it was just having a structure to keep the shape , and so we first photographed it with the electron microscope years and years ago , and you see this cell is actually quite pretty .
all right . and here is this beautiful human cell , and you can imagine that here also , context goes .
and here is another five seconds of repose , is my mantra . form and function .
has a coherent movement .
now if you take the mammary gland and spread it and take the fat away , on a dish it looks like that .
and i 'd never competed on a disabled level , you know -- i 'd always competed against other able-bodied athletes .
that 's all i wanted -- just two practices .
and putting on my georgetown uniform and going out there and knowing that , you know , in order to become better -- and i 'm already the best in the country -- you know , you have to train with people who are inherently better than you .
am : okay , well , atlanta .
i tried to get it out of anybody i could , you know , " who am i running against here ? "
and i 'm thinking that 's my last card to play here ; if i 'm not going to beat these girls , i 'm going to mess their heads a little , you know ?
you 've got to come up and see them .
am : i don 't know . i don 't think so .
for me , while i 'm such a serious athlete on the track , i want to be feminine off the track , and i think it 's so important not to be limited in any capacity , whether it 's , you know , your mobility or even fashion .
am : i said to the receptionist -- i mean , i am just harried , and sheryl 's at my side -- i said , " look , do you have anybody here who could help me ?
they 're just practicing .
so it wasn 't all the good side of the illness .
you know , i like to call it " the national automobile slum . "
so how is that being accomplished here ?
but this is how we do it in the united states .
and they 're sitting there at the long boardroom table with all the drawings , and the renderings , and all the chinese food caskets are lying on the table , and -- i mean , what was the conversation that was going on there ?
and that 's how we do it .
because it hasn 't delivered what it 's been promising for half a century now .
notice that nature is present .
we can see some of the first ideas for retro-fitting some of the catastrophic property that we have in america .
one final thing -- i 've been very disturbed about this for years , but i think it 's particularly important for this audience .
and more controversially , recently , apple censored a palestinian protest app after the israeli government voiced concerns that it might be used to organize violent attacks .
but you 'll see here a blocked page of what happens when you try to reach certain facebook pages and some other websites that the transitional authorities have determined might incite violence .
the other part of the story are requirements that the chinese government places on all companies operating on the chinese internet , known as a system of self-discipline .
so what we need to recognize is that if we want to have a citizen-centric internet in the future , we need a broader and more sustained internet freedom movement .
shouldn 't we be thinking hard about how to get off fossil fuels ? "
what do we do with these numbers ?
top left , we have canada and australia , with enormous land areas , very high per capita consumption , 200 or 300 light bulbs per person , and very low population densities .
what does that mean ? and you might have anticipated that result , given what i told you about the biofuel plantation a moment ago .
so here 's a summary so far .
in addition to those levers , we could talk about other ways of solving this issue , namely , we could reduce demand , and that means reducing population — i 'm not sure how to do that — or reducing per capita consumption .
i 've tried it . it works . some people call it a lifestyle change .
and a fourth supply side option , concentrating solar power in other people 's deserts , if you wanted to get 16 light bulbs ' worth , then we 're talking about these eight hexagons down at the bottom right .
the victorians were great engineers .
well , i bumped into this whole thing completely by accident .
one of your students must have been passing by , showed them how to use the mouse . "
i 'd seen it happen over and over and over again .
so i said , " it 's very topical , very important . but it 's all in english . "
so she says , " absolutely not .
could it be that , at the point in time when you need to know something , you can find out in two minutes ?
but the age of empires is gone .
grandmother : well done ! very good .
sm : a decade ahead of her time .
my wish is to help design a future of learning by supporting children all over the world to tap into their wonder and their ability to work together .
and i was trying to take a picture of her quietly .
on the right there is another robot doll , who you could get a couple of years ago .
we 'll just put some crap here .
let 's run this video .
come over here . now notice , he thinks robots have to be a bit stiff .
i just want to show you one technical diagram here .
kismet has an underlying , three-dimensional emotional space , a vector space , of where it is emotionally .
not appropriate . no . no .
and here 's another aspect of the sorts of things that chris and i were doing .
we don 't like to give up our special-ness , so , you know , having the idea that robots could really have emotions , or that robots could be living creatures -- i think is going to be hard for us to accept .
and when i was in beloit , wisconsin , i gave a public lecture to a group of middle school students .
so basically we had automobiles , but we were unaware of the forms of life that make up most of the genetic information on our planet .
that as we explore these strings of a 's , t 's , c 's and g 's , we may uncover a completely new class of life that , like beijerinck , will fundamentally change the way that we think about the nature of biology .
i hope you 'll forgive me if i don 't perform a kind of one-man savant show for you today .
three is green .
let 's go back to the questions i posed you a moment ago .
some people say it 's happy .
i hope that i 've given you the desire to learn to see the world with new eyes .
now our friend over there , albert einstein , used to pay very little attention when people said , " you know , there 's a man with an experiment that seems to disagree with special relativity .
and when the mathematics is very simple -- when in terms of some mathematical notation , you can write the theory in a very brief space , without a lot of complication -- that 's essentially what we mean by beauty or elegance .
and we keep doing that , and build more powerful machines , accelerators for particles .
you rotate around the center of the circle , the circle remains unchanged .
now , here is a very exciting development that many people have not heard of .
four sources told it . that when they had the plague in cambridge , and he went down to his mother 's farm -- because the university was closed -- he saw an apple fall from a tree , or on his head or something .
life can emerge from physics and chemistry , plus a lot of accidents .
this is the dead duck . it flew against the window .
and here 's the situation again .
this is its first time on the u.s. west coast .
this is a turkey in wisconsin on the premises of the ethan allen juvenile correctional institution .
and as you know , or as you may not know , this is one of the major causes of death for birds in the world .
what nfb wanted was not a vehicle that can drive a blind person around , but a vehicle where a blind person can make active decisions and drive .
the system is also smart enough to figure out the safest way to operate the car .
so think of it as a monitor for the blind .
he 's closing in on the van to make the moving pass .
or for the blind , everyday home appliances -- in the educational setting , in the office setting .
the only thing that they can 't copy is the actual trademark label within that piece of apparel .
maybe just a little .
tom ford : and we found after much research that -- actually not much research , quite simple research -- that the counterfeit customer was not our customer .
he has complained a lot about people copying him , but in one interview i read , he said it has really forced him to up his game .
they knock themselves off .
that is a very difficult question to answer .
so you talk to people in the fashion industry and they 're like , " shhh !
it 's a digital file .
we need to shine light to see what we 're doing .
this is how we excise cancers .
so wouldn 't it be better if we could really tell , if the surgeon could really tell , whether or not there 's still cancer on the surgical field ?
but here it is . it 's fluorescent .
so if you 're driving on the freeway and you want to know where 's the next gas station , you have a map to tell you that that gas station is down the road .
nerves , if they are injured , can cause paralysis , can cause pain .
here you 're looking at a sciatic nerve of a mouse , and you can see that that big , fat portion you can see very easily .
they said , " wow !
every single one of them has evolved their own version of what 's been called the golden rule .
this is the source of all morality , this imaginative act of empathy , putting yourself in the place of another .
you also have to do it .
and i am convinced .
and if you do the math , that 's 130 people every minute .
they called their landlord a wabenzi , meaning that he is a person who has enough money to drive a mercedes-benz .
' once you have stayed here , ' he said , ' you can stay for the rest of your life . ' " so , he has hope , and this is where these communities start .
they 're quite vital places , these communities .
people tap in and they have thieves who are called " grillos " or " crickets , " and they steal the electrical power and wire the neighborhood .
so , these are the civic leaders of the future .
but , actually , it 's suddenly come to me after years working in the business , that what we create in advertising , which is intangible value -- you might call it perceived value , you might call it badge value , subjective value , intangible value of some kind -- gets rather a bad rap .
so i was discussing this . and i actually went to the marginal revolution blog by tyler cowen . i don 't know if anybody knows it .
before long , there was a massive underground potato-growing operation in germany .
what 's fascinating about these signs is they cost about 10 percent of the running cost of a conventional speed camera , but they prevent twice as many accidents .
what 's also interesting , if you look at products that have a high component of what you might call messaging value , a high component of intangible value , versus their intrinsic value : they are often quite egalitarian .
this is food 2.0 , which is food you produce for the purpose of sharing it with other people .
yet we 've never created the opportunity for impulse saving .
so i just want to get your first impressions when you see that , when you see the diamond shreddies box there .
one of them is , " poetry is when you make new things familiar and familiar things new . "
i started going out on cases .
their mates were chosen for them .
and it makes anything possible , makes anything rationalizable .
i flew out in front of the car , and then he ran over my legs .
some things worked , some things didn 't .
and somebody donated tennis shoes for me .
so while sally , the office manager , was teaching me to speak in the day -- it 's hard , because when you 're a kid , you take things for granted .
so one of the seniors just came up to me , and she pushed me up to the corner and she said , " when you think it 's time to go , just stick the cane out there .
but when i looked down , i realized that time marched on for me too and that i needed to get caught up , so i got going on it .
madame , would you like some of those orange bangles with the pink polka dots ?
why should we do this as indians and pakistanis ?
or maybe it 's because when i was a teenager back in the ' 50s , my uncle henry -- having denounced the ku klux klan and been bombed for his trouble and had crosses burned in his yard , living under death threat -- took his wife and children to massachusetts for safety and went back to south carolina to face down the klan alone .
mr. teszler went down to the plant and confronted the thief and said , " but why do you steal from me ? if you need money you have only to ask . "
" well , i don 't rightly know , mr. teszler . i reckon that would be kings mountain . "
and there were none . in one fell swoop , mr. teszler had integrated the textile industry in that part of the south .
and i made a vow to myself , then and there , that if this man who had such cause to think otherwise had reached that conclusion , i would not presume to differ until he released me from my vow .
and what they were arguing about was this : whether the second harry potter movie was as good as the first .
so i was curious about why there was a disconnect between the way our society perceives doodling and the way that the reality is .
i think that our culture is so intensely focused on verbal information that we 're almost blinded to the value of doodling .
i think that means doodling is native to us and we simply are denying ourselves that instinct .
so one girl said , very cleverly , " it 's very easy .
and you can see we still have afghanistan down here .
and united states only had some , one , two thousand dollars at that time .
or google is quite generous , so he can have one or two years to go .
and this is the number of people .
i heard that your departments here were by regions .
many are not aware of -- no , this is not a joke .
we have a continuum . but we still have , of course , congo , up there . we still have as poor countries as we have had , always , in history .
and third chance for sweden , against brazil here .
we have to really find a way of supporting those countries in a better way .
if i split tanzania in its income , the richer 20 percent in tanzania has more hiv than the poorest one .
that used to be the illegal diamond trade , from the unita-dominated area in angola .
we the children had gathered at a friend 's house .
and i realized that , when i 'd left the country , free and fair elections in a democratic environment were a dream .
the heat was on .
it could be , by the will of the masses who were now urgently pressing with all their heart and all their will for peace .
i 'd like to begin by talking about some of the ideas that motivated me to become a documentary photographer .
every story does not have to sell something .
this is a scene of house-to-house fighting in mostar , neighbor against neighbor .
american troops were sent to protect the relief shipments , but they were eventually drawn into the conflict , and after the tragic battle in mogadishu , they were withdrawn .
the image reminded me of a cave painting , and echoed how primitive we still are in so many ways .
by the age of 12 or 14 , they 'd become beggars and drug addicts .
this is a scene from new orleans .
it was obvious that the shi 'ites were a force to be reckoned with , and we would do well to understand them and learn how to deal with them .
and i 'm going to show you two videos that have gotten a lot of attention recently that i think embody this philosophy .
but you get about 80 percent of the way there , for about one percent of the cost .
these islands — mauritius , rodrigues , and réunion — along with the island of madagascar , they are blessed with unique plants found nowhere else in the world .
and as you can see , the island of mauritius where i work and where i live , belongs to one such biodiversity hotspot , and i study the unique plants on the island for their biomedical applications .
now this plant here , the baobab , could be part of the answer .
what i have showed you here is only the species from africa , adansonia digitata .
so let 's take a look at this plant here , centella asiatica . it 's a weed .
now , that 's been the promise of the self-driving car , the autonomous vehicle , and it 's been the dream since at least 1939 , when general motors showcased this idea at their futurama booth at the world 's fair .
we 've also worked with volkswagen oracle , on shelley , an autonomous race car that has raced at 150 miles an hour through the bonneville salt flats , gone around thunderhill raceway park in the sun , the wind and the rain , and navigated the 153 turns and 12.4 miles of the pikes peak hill climb route in colorado with nobody at the wheel .
now , clearly we 're not going to put a couple of electrodes on his head and understand exactly what all of his thoughts are on the track .
i 'm going to take you around now to the other side of the track .
can , in fact , the technology not simply replace humans , but allow us to reach the level of reflex and intuition that we 're all capable of ?
she 's one of 13,000 orphans and vulnerable children who are assisted by a charity that i support .
it gives me a different angle on the aid issue .
before the crisis , this would have been utterly unthinkable , yet it was accepted remarkably quickly .
so it would work like this : if in a given year the government gave 0.2 percent of its income to overseas aid , the central bank would simply top it up with a further 0.2 percent .
even though this is the printing of just three central banks , the global aid that 's given over this period is up by almost 40 percent .
we 'll just take one example here : a virus is a natural system , right ?
so we start simple , we make some structures that may have some of these characteristics of life , and then we try to develop that to become more lifelike .
so we 're on a road towards living systems .
now , this doesn 't have a brain , it doesn 't have a neural system . this is just a sack of chemicals that is able to have this interesting and complex lifelike behavior .
just with blobs of chemicals , again .
but they have lifelike properties , is the point .
my role on the show , for those of you who haven 't seen it -- it 's pretty simple .
and i 'm given a horse and we go get the lambs and we take them to a pen that we built , and we go about the business of animal husbandry .
i say , " time out . stop . "
lamb goes on the ground , lamb takes two steps , falls down , gets up , shakes a little , takes another couple steps , falls down .
i do .
it 's what our network does ; it 's what " dirty jobs " is .
look , i don 't know if your brain is interested in this sort of thing or not , but do you realize you 've shot in every state ?
follow your passion -- what could possibly be wrong with that ?
safety -- safety first ?
you want to get home alive , that 's on you .
i mean , so many of the commercials that come out there -- in the way of a message , what 's really being said ?
so , we 're thinking -- by we , i mean me -- that the thing to do is to talk about a pr campaign for work , manual labor , skilled labor .
and you can actually roll some of the pictures now , because i don 't want to look at me on the screen .
but they get the information that causes them to stop , causes them to internalize that they need to make all of the various parts that will cause them to change their shape , and try to get out of this capillary and find out what 's going on .
but it 's really quite amazing that these cells , these micro-machines , are aware enough of what the cell needs that they do their bidding .
so , actually , if you listen carefully , there 's supposed to be five variations on this abegg theme .
am i going to use a two-page spread like a comic book for more grandiose effect , i guess ?
gh : ok . c , g , b , a and e.
when people see my images , a lot of times they 'll say , " oh my god . " have you ever wondered what that meant ?
we so rarely note how different it is from moment to moment , with clouds coming and going .
and i 'm going to spend the next few minutes trying to convince you that physics can teach us something about marketing .
by measuring it , the act of measurement changes it .
think about toyota .
it makes this distribution of energy a democratizing force , which is ultimately good for your brand .
and when they 're missing , it 's a barrier .
now you 've lost your arm above the elbow .
so you might say , let 's go to the brain and put something in the brain to record signals , or in the end of the peripheral nerve and record them there .
on the left side he 's got a modern motorized prosthesis with those three joints , and he operates little pads in his shoulder that he touches to make the arm go .
and we 're only able to use three of the signals at this time .
so amanda , would you please tell us how you lost your arm ?
ak : a little faster . and much more easy , much more natural .
so we collaborated with our colleagues in university of new brunswick , came up with this algorithm control , which amanda can now demonstrate .
takes about a minute .
tk : that 's claudia , and that was the first time she got to feel sensation through her prosthetic .
once we can do it that small , it 's a lot easier making them bigger .
i began to look into this stuff on the internet , in books and in documentary films , in my travels with my family .
i discovered that there 's a movement for a better way .
he asked him if he wanted organic toasted o 's or the sugarcoated flakes -- you know , the one with the big striped cartoon character on the front .
so david and i decided to go find out , through the best research we could muster , what it would take to get a little girl to put her hands on a computer , to achieve the level of comfort and ease with the technology that little boys have because they play video games .
these two titles both showed up in the top 50 entertainment titles in pc data -- entertainment titles in pc data in december , right up there with " john madden football , " which thrills me to death .
girl 5 : for a girl 's game also usually they 'll have really pretty scenery with clouds and flowers .
i mean , i heard his band is playing at another party the same night .
we 're not trying to tell them who they ought to be .
i was seeing myself not from my perspective , but vividly and continuously from the perspective of other people 's responses to me .
in fact , i now call the underwater wheelchair " portal , " because it 's literally pushed me through into a new way of being , into new dimensions and into a new level of consciousness .
i , like most of you , was sitting down , the day after christmas in 2004 , when i was watching the devastating news of the asian tsunami as it rolled in , playing out on tv .
okay , i 'm going to give you a bit of a demonstration .
the lifesaver bottle works really simply .
it 'll last for 6,000 liters .
and where do people live ? near water .
she was the wife of an even more famous brahmin .
and so it transpired that a horse was killed , a god was made sin-free , a brahmin 's ego was appeased , a woman ... was ruined , and a one-eyed monkey was left ...
you can 't have barriers , because it breaks through your prejudices , breaks through everything that you have as your mask , that says , " i am this , i am that , i am that . "
well , millions of people around the world die of waterborne disease every year .
i have a solution that requires neither machine , nor wood , nor cooking gas .
i think it 's safe to say that all of us here are deeply concerned about the escalating violence in our daily lives .
too small for detection , it 's your built-in protection .
what i need to say to the planners of the world , the governments , the strategists is , " you have treated the arts as the cherry on the cake .
he invited all the princes to come and defeat his daughter at whistling .
how do you discover the uniqueness of a project as unique as a person ?
a toroid , for those who don 't know , is the surface of a doughnut or , for some of us , a bagel .
and then you descend to light and to the north and to life .
and as you come from the north , it is all masonry growing out of the sand cliffs as you come from the himalayas and evoking the tradition of the fortress .
and then , coming towards the north , it opens up : it bursts out of the mountain into , again , a view of light and of the city and of the jerusalem hills .
i have a quote that i like by a morphologist , 1917 , theodore cook , who said , " beauty connotes humanity .
ladies and gentlemen , the world has gotten smaller .
it has empowered you , it has empowered me and it has empowered some other guys as well .
you will not like it .
in 2006 , a few months after , i went ivory coast -- western africa .
they can disappear and escape bullets .
the first day , they were even shouting at each other .
so really , it 's not about the freedom of cartoonists ; it 's about your freedoms .
we did 250 hours of diving here in 2005 .
but this is a consequence .
and when you go to the pristine side , did this ever bleach ?
the number of species increases 21 percent ; so if you have 1,000 species you would expect 200 more in a marine reserve .
reserves are like savings accounts .
if this is so good , if this is such a no-brainer , how much of this do we have ?
second , the governance is not right because most coastal communities around the world don 't have the authority to monitor the resources to create the reserve and enforce it .
how could 85 percent survive on 15 percent ?
if the world was a smarter place , we could solve this problem for negative 19 billion dollars .
if they went exploring into the parents ' rooms , or even into the secret filing cabinets , they were punished , and told that for their own good they must never go in there again .
what they hadn 't counted on was digitization , because that meant that all those paper receipts had been scanned in electronically , and it was very easy for somebody to just copy that entire database , put it on a disk , and then just saunter outside of parliament , which they did , and then they shopped that disk to the highest bidder , which was the daily telegraph , and then , you all remember , there was weeks and weeks of revelations , everything from porn movies and bath plugs and new kitchens and mortgages that had never been paid off .
and it 's getting harder to hide assets , tax avoidance , pay inequality . so that 's great . we 're starting to find out more and more about these systems .
you can try and find out how he 's moving out assets from that country .
the other thing is that power is incredibly seductive , and you must have two real qualities , i think , when you come to the table , when you 're dealing with power , talking about power , because of its seductive capacity .
so he was talking about the law in britain which is the communications data bill , an absolutely outrageous piece of legislation .
they 're far more efficient in terms of energy .
i mean , thousands of dollars , lots of man hours made to make this eight-foot robot .
all the local information is embedded to tell you how to fix it .
so i think these projects i 've showed here are just a tiny step towards this future , if we implement these new technologies for a new self-assembling world .
there are 38,000 suicides each year in the united states .
these are , indeed , the chronic disorders of young people .
now , already in the case of the brain disorders that i 've been talking to you about , depression , obsessive compulsive disorder , post-traumatic stress disorder , while we don 't have an in-depth understanding of how they are abnormally processed or what the brain is doing in these illnesses , we have been able to already identify some of the connectional differences , or some of the ways in which the circuitry is different for people who have these disorders .
if we waited until the heart attack , we would be sacrificing 1.1 million lives every year in this country to heart disease .
so i 'm not going to spend too much time -- just to show you , refresh your memories that we are here for " africa : the next chapter " because for the first time there really is a platform to build on .
what does this mean ?
so now we have this platform we can build on .
the issue is how are we using what has been given back .
so i was the oldest person in the house .
and then they toweled her down because she started sweating , which was a good sign .
what has happened in europe ?
and they 're also going from country to country , and many times trying to find what to do .
and we don 't do it because there are so many of us . we don 't coordinate .
invest some of your resources in that , too . "
second thing , for the private sector , people are afraid to take risks on the continent .
so take away from here is how are you going to put together the resources to put money in the hands of women in the middle who are ready -- business people who want to expand and create more jobs .
if you try to weigh it -- of course it 's very easy to weigh it , and when you eat it , the weight matters -- but suppose you try to measure its surface .
humanity had to learn about measuring roughness .
the volume of a lung is very small , but what about the area of the lung ?
something so complicated like a cloud , so unstable , so varying , should have a simple rule behind it .
well , a man named hausdorff in 1919 introduced a number which was just a mathematical joke , and i found that this number was a good measurement of roughness .
so brownian motion , which happens to have a roughness number of two , goes around .
well , these other lines include some real price increments and some forgery which i did .
this is a construction of a man named [ gaston ] julia and [ pierre ] fatou .
the color was added for two reasons .
it 's biodegradable . it 's reusable .
what we need to do is we need to learn to do more with less .
so our old lettuces and products that we have thrown out that are made out of biodegradable materials , if they end up in landfill , contribute to climate change .
i mean , there 's a lot of complex systems going on here .
we 've had to plant seeds , phosphorus , fertilizers , nutrients , water , sunlight .
how do i make the materials green in the manufacturing ? "
now , i looked at a number of kettles available on the market , and found the minimum fill lines , so the little piece of information that tells you how much you need to put in there , was between two and a five-and-a-half cups of water just to make one cup of tea .
so we need to find smarter , more systems-based , innovative solutions to these problems , if we 're going to start to live sustainably within this world .
i said , " how come you 're not doing sustainability ? i know you know this . "
if you watch closely — if you watch closely , you may have seen some of the eigenmodes , but also you may have seen that jazz music is better with fire .
and these trend lines , you can see , there 's more questions than answers in the laws of physics , and when we reach the end of a sentence , we place a star at that location .
this is fairly amazing to me .
i did enjoy bono 's comment linking haight-ashbury to silicon valley .
we had our best ph.d. students , our most advanced equipment around the world , we got 1 / 10,000th of the project done , so how 're we going to get this done in 15 years ?
but anyway , the evolution of our species took hundreds of thousands of years , and then working through interaction , evolution used , essentially , the technology-creating species to bring on the next stage , which were the first steps in technological evolution .
that hit a wall . they couldn 't shrink them and keep the vacuum .
they 're faster , so you 've got exponential growth in the speed of transistors , so the cost of a cycle of one transistor has been coming down with a halving rate of 1.1 years .
we 'd like to actually turn that program off .
one has one that actually walks with a surprisingly human-like gait , that 's built out of molecules .
well , it turns out we can see inside the human brain , and in fact not surprisingly , the spatial and temporal resolution of brain scanning is doubling every year .
images will be written directly to our retina , providing full-immersion virtual reality , augmented real reality . we 'll be interacting with virtual personalities .
many -- even scientists -- assume a linear model , so they 'll say , " oh , it 'll be hundreds of years before we have self-replicating nano-technology assembly or artificial intelligence . "
this is a part of that .
when i started teaching them , i said let me start doing this professionally .
the next slide i 'm about to show you , is a little more serious .
you know , there are a hundred types of brushes .
and i saw my work come alive .
i said , in exchange for education in how to paint , i will support them , and i started a company .
so what we did was we rented a little van and we drove all over the east coast trying to sell it .
my mother fell very ill .
a very , very dear friend of mine came out of the closet , and in india at that time , it was illegal to be gay , and it 's disgusting to see how people respond to a gay person .
my mother miraculously recovered after a serious operation , and this man was elected president of this country .
they , in fact , told me three weeks .
recent surveys show that 92 percent of veterans want to continue their service when they take off their uniform .
that mission is to defend the freedom of the family that he left at home .
but you send him to joplin after a tornado , and somebody once again is walking up to him and shaking their hand and thanking them for their service , now they have self-worth again .
my whole right side was ripped open , filled with gravel .
the vertebra at l1 was like you 'd dropped a peanut , stepped on it , smashed it into thousands of pieces .
they moved me from intensive care to acute spinal .
but before i left the hospital , the head nurse had said to me , " janine , i want you to be ready , because when you get home , something 's going to happen . "
maria was in a car accident , and she woke up on her 16th birthday to the news that she was a complete quadriplegic , had no movement from the neck down , had damage to her vocal chords , and she couldn 't talk .
if i can 't walk , then i might as well fly . "
andrew the instructor got in the front , started the airplane up .
so while the doctors continued to operate and put my body back together again , i went on with my theory study , and then eventually , and amazingly , i passed my pilot 's medical , and that was my green light to fly .
i know that i 'm not my body , and i also know that you 're not yours .
the size of the bubble is the population , and on this axis here i put fertility rate .
this is india . indonesia 's moving on pretty fast .
and we have most who lived in absolute poverty were asians .
data is often better than you think . many people say data is bad .
now that 's dangerous , to use average data , because there is such a lot of difference within countries . so if i go and look here , we can see that uganda today is where south korea was 1960 . if i split uganda , there 's quite a difference within uganda . these are the quintiles of uganda .
we cannot give the data free to the students , free to the entrepreneurs of the world . "
now , statisticians doesn 't like it , because they say that this will not show the reality ; we have to have statistical , analytical methods .
but for us , i want to talk about three factors today .
and i believe that the decades ahead of us now will be to a greater or lesser extent turbulent the more or less we are able to achieve that aim : to bring governance to the global space .
well it seems to me that we 're now seeing a fundamental shift of power , broadly speaking , away from nations gathered around the atlantic [ seaboard ] to the nations gathered around the pacific rim .
now notice , in a period which is dominated by a mono-polar world , you have fixed alliances -- nato , the warsaw pact .
oh yes ? why not ?
we are all now deeply , deeply , deeply interconnected .
if it is the case , ladies and gentlemen -- and it is -- that we are now locked together in a way that has never been quite the same before , then it 's also the case that we share a destiny with each other .
as other speakers have said , it 's a rather daunting experience -- a particularly daunting experience -- to be speaking in front of this audience .
we 're not top on people 's lists for dinner party guests and conversations and so on .
and for some reason -- which shall remain rather vague -- we 're interested in a particular pattern .
so you 've all got to think about this , and you 've all got to vote -- and we 're not moving on .
so imagine -- let 's suppose we 're doing it .
what 's the point i want to make ?
well , there are lots of reasons .
don 't think you don 't trust me anymore .
each of those explanations has a likely bit and an unlikely bit .
so if you toss a coin twice , the chance of getting a head twice are a half -- that 's the chance the first time -- times a half -- the chance a second time .
it 's exactly the same in this context .
so just to conclude -- what are the take-home messages from this ?
usually -- one hopes -- innocently , but misrepresented evidence .
they 're people getting out of poverty as fast as they can .
for the last 50 years , we have focused on treating the individual gene in understanding cancer , not in controlling cancer .
i co-founded a company called navigenics , where , if you spit into a tube -- and we can look look at 35 or 40 genetic markers for disease , all of which are delayable in many of the cancers -- you start to identify what you could get , and then we can start to work to prevent them .
so , it is the idea of sequencing all of the genes in the cancer , and giving us a new lexicon , a new dictionary to describe it .
if you could start to move that , to identify what you 're up against , you 're going to do things a hell of a lot better .
and , believe it or not , there were hisses in the audience .
and so , if you think of cancer as a system , there 's an input and an output and a state in the middle .
nobody has ever shown -- and this will be shocking -- nobody has ever shown that most chemotherapy actually touches a cancer cell .
so the diseases we have today , which reflect patterns in the system over the last several decades , are going to change dramatically over the next decade or so based on things like this .
so , it was done on this group of patients .
but if one is unfortunate to get a disease , you 'll go into your doctor 's office , he or she will take a drop of blood , and we will start to know how to treat your disease .
we need to start to think differently and radically .
to what extent do we self-construct , do we self-invent ?
and you know what that means , of course .
it 's such an eye-opening experience to be here .
anyway .
but then on top of that , you know , sarah jones told me we only have 18 minutes .
right now it 's very exciting actually for me because i 'm the junior assistant to the associate director under the senior vice president for business development -- that 's my new title .
and we were only 11 years old , so it was not appropriate .
uh , well , thank you .
she only wants to spend time with her friends .
and i would like to first of all thank sarah jones for putting all of the pressure on the only arab who she brought with her to be last today .
and i pray that this is the way that we will self-invent , in time .
so i wrote a letter .
more than three and a half thousand photos go up onto facebook .
and finding the source becomes more and more important -- finding the good source -- and twitter is where most journalists now go .
oh , shit !
this is from hama .
so we go a bit further . we switch to the satellite view , and we find another bridge , and everything starts to line up .
thanks very much .
the self was not constant .
i was a noticeable nobody .
so in africa , there 's been more time to create genetic diversity . "
for a start , we can think about all the times when we do lose ourselves .
and over time and with practice , i 've tried to live more and more from my essence .
but nothing else does either .
never mind that i had no idea what ginger beer was .
the only thing my mother told us about him was that his family was very poor .
but in the u.s. whenever africa came up people turned to me .
but i must quickly add that i too am just as guilty in the question of the single story .
i told him that i had just read a novel called american psycho -- -- and that it was such a shame that young americans were serial murderers .
i 've always felt that it is impossible to engage properly with a place or a person without engaging with all of the stories of that place and that person .
what if my roommate knew about the female lawyer who recently went to court in nigeria to challenge a ridiculous law that required women to get their husband 's consent before renewing their passports ?
and i could see everybody looked at me , somebody said , " bollywood . "
you 're a director , you 've done it for years . "
and i say , " cate , what do you want to do ? "
and i would think , " daddy , how far does the universe go ? "
we are the stories we tell ourselves .
and i said , " why ? " he said , " because nobody is going to give you a film if you talk about subtext .
they said , " we won the armada . "
are you with child ?
you no longer have the queen 's protection .
so how do i start all this ?
there 's a mythology in india about -- where they say , and i 'll say it in hindi , [ hindi ] right . what does that mean ?
it 's the effect of looking for harmony in the contradiction that exists in a poet 's mind , a contradiction that exists in a storyteller 's mind .
so let me start with genomics .
but most things , you really have to know what 's going on in the kitchen , because , mostly , sick people used to be healthy people -- they have the same genome .
there 's a huge amount of information about the genetics just by comparing the genetic similarity .
i kept getting this call from this oncologist named david agus .
they really tell us what 's going on there .
so this already , i think , is tremendously useful in all kinds of medicine .
well , right now what we do is we divide it by part of the body -- you know , where did it appear ? -- and we put you in different categories according to the part of the body .
so your house is dealing with leaks all the time , but it 's fixing them . it 's draining them out and so on .
and so i believe that this will be the way that cancer will be treated in the future .
and when i went to find out something , i used scientific methods . i wasn 't real surprised , you know , when they first told me how -- how you were supposed to do science , because i 'd already been doing it for fun and whatever .
one thing , he put a bird in there , and he pumped all the air out , and the bird died . so he said , hmm ...
it 's two fans , one which he could turn from outside after he got the vacuum established , and he discovered that if he pulled all the air out of it , the one fan would no longer turn the other one , right ?
and seeing what happens , it was ok to generalize , and say , i 'm sure that this will happen anytime we make one of these things .
remember , that 's a short time .
i didn 't take it personally , but -- i just -- i had -- i naively had thought , until this surfing experience started me into the 17th century , i 'd thought that 's just the way people thought , and everybody did , and they recognized reality by what they could see or touch or feel or hear .
i 'm sure it 's got to do with rockets or it wouldn 't be in that manual .
and we had not -- i mean , we weren 't frightened by it .
and no tricky shit behind the thing . i mean , it 's all -- you 've got to be very honest with what you 're doing if it really is going to work .
but a lot of people got in it for the money and the power and the travel .
but in fact , it was just coming up -- it was the nighttime ; the daytime temperatures didn 't go up .
they 're concerned , and you can tell they have very guarded conclusions in these papers , because they 're talking about big laboratories that are funded by lots of money and by scared people .
now , on the other side of the network , you tend to have primarily african-american and latino folks who are really concerned about somewhat different things than the geeks are , but just to give some sense , the green part of the network we call smalltimore , for those of us that inhabit it , because it seems as though we 're living in a very small town .
other boy bands , country singers , gospel music , funk and rap and stand-up comedy , and there 's even a whole section around drugs and jokes .
others battle oppressive societies .
i was faced with an organized defamation campaign in the local media combined with false rumors shared in family gatherings , in the streets and in schools .
and to my surprise , it got hundreds of thousands of views the first day .
there was this official study that was presented to the shura council -- it 's the consultative council appointed by the king in saudi arabia — and it was done by a local professor , a university professor .
i know .
i learned to be always there .
and i don 't know how i became one now .
this rebirth of grass . and then i went out for years trying to photograph the pristine landscape .
and these ages of man are still at work today .
what you 're looking at here -- i went to bangladesh , so i started to move away from north america ; i started to look at our world globally .
so this created a reservoir 600 kilometers long , one of the largest reservoirs ever created .
this is wushan , one of the largest cities that was relocated .
this is a shift change , one of three .
in fact , even shenzhen , the economic zone -- one of the first ones -- 15 years ago was about 100,000 people , and today it boasts about 10 to 11 million .
and again , looking at these images , there 's this constant , like , haze that you 're seeing .
the machines are all running , absolutely incredible to see what the scale of industries are .
there 's 21,000 employees . this one factory -- and they had several of them -- is half a kilometer long .
and to me the whole notion -- the things i 'm photographing are out of a great concern about the scale of our progress and what we call progress .
what was unusual , according to stephen , is less than five percent of ads are actually leading with image .
in that way , what 's happening is that we 're motivating a certain age group to start thinking .
we go into the cold war , and we continue to try and build walls .
last year , at this time , there were 20 vessels , 500 mariners held hostage .
this kind of trafficking , in narcotics , in humans , in weapons , god forbid , in weapons of mass destruction , is part of the threat to the global commons .
you would be correct .
they 're all part of this .
why do we want to be involved ?
you don 't have to have a military that is either in hard combat or is in the barracks .
visual effects are based on the principles of all illusions : assumption , things are as we know them ; presumption , things will behave as we expect ; and context in reality , our knowledge of the world as we know it , such as scale .
and so while other kids were bbm-ing their parents , i was literally waiting by the mailbox to get a letter from home to see how the weekend had gone , which was a little frustrating when grandma was in the hospital , but i was just looking for some sort of scribble , some unkempt cursive from my mother .
these are the kinds of stories that convinced me that letter-writing will never again need to flip back her hair and talk about efficiency , because she is an art form now , all the parts of her , the signing , the scripting , the mailing , the doodles in the margins .
nor am i going to talk about what i think are obvious statements from my first book , " silicon snake oil , " or my second book , nor am i going to talk about why i believe computers don 't belong in schools .
what i ask myself is , what 's society is going to be like , when the kids today are phenomenally good at text messaging and spend a huge amount of on-screen time , but have never gone bowling together ?
so it 's highly -- that one 's the cool one .
he wrote a letter of recommendation for me to get into graduate school .
is true . is true . i teach eighth-grade science four days a week .
i was all set to do it and i was thinking , " aw man , " i was just going to impose upon the powers that be , and measure the speed of light .
i 'll put it over here , and as i move this away from the source , you 'll notice the spiral .
there 's a riot ! hey , elmo 's done : off .
the time 's going backwards because i 'm inside of it .
and the mosquito has killed more humans than wars and plague .
now the odd thing is , is that once you 've been bitten by this mosquito , and you 've had this disease , your body develops antibodies , so if you 're bitten again with that strain , it doesn 't affect you .
well , there 's two principle ways .
we don 't want to have a lasting impact on the environment .
so here 's a typical situation , male meets female , lots of offspring .
and we 've got a production unit in oxford , or just south of oxford , where we actually produce these mosquitos .
both have a side benefit , which is that we reduce pesticide use tremendously .
so you 're looking at roughly one percent of the brain of a cockroach .
this experiment revealed the first , and perhaps most fundamental , nugget of the neural code : that information is written in the form of electrical impulses .
because the light-activated pore is encoded in dna , we can achieve incredible precision .
they didn 't get very far , obviously .
so we set out to identify the cells in the fly 's brain that played the role of the critic .
these 12 cells , as shown here in green , send the output to a brain structure called the " mushroom body , " which is shown here in gray .
in the experiments i told you about , we have lifted the identity of the critic , but we still have no idea how the critic does its job .
so i suppose you 're not going to be able to kick me off the stage , since you asked the question .
but , yeah , it was sad at the time , but we moved on .
rb : i should have .
when i first came to america , i used to try this with employees as well and they kind of -- they have these different rules over here , it 's very strange .
rb : yeah , it 'll be ready in -- well , ready in 12 months and then we do 12 months extensive testing .
and , i mean , first of all we -- nobody had actually crossed the atlantic in a hot air balloon before , so we had to build a hot air balloon that was capable of flying in the jet stream , and we weren 't quite sure , when a balloon actually got into the jet stream , whether it would actually survive the 200 , 220 miles an hour winds that you can find up there .
but fortunately , they never had to use it .
and generally , the people would say , oh , well that 's bad news .
do you look at the current generation of kids coming up and think they 're too coddled , they don 't know what they 've got , we 're going to raise a generation of privileged ...
it 's actually a nickname given to priests in the eighteenth century . "
i mean , do you think about life balance ?
we 're trying to -- maybe we 'll change it -- but anyway , it 's a war room to try to coordinate all the attack that 's going on in africa , all the different social problems in africa , and try to look at best practices .
i mean , the psychologist erik erikson says that -- as i understand him and i 'm a total amateur -- but that during 30s , 40s people are driven by this desire to grow and that 's where they get their fulfillment .
now , if you 're my five-year-old , your internet consists mostly of puppies and fairies and occasionally fairies riding puppies .
wrong .
you too , apparently .
you know , questions and curiosity like maddie 's are magnets that draw us towards our teachers , and they transcend all technology or buzzwords in education .
and rule number three : practice reflection .
thank you very much .
but , moving mountains can be dangerous . let me try and explain why .
that 's the sahara eating up almost [ two meters ] a day of the arable land , physically pushing people away from their homes .
if people live inside of the green barrier they can help support the trees , protect them from humans , and from some of the forces of nature .
and , after an initial cost of 60 bucks to buy the bacteria , which you 'll never have to pay again , one cubic meter of bacterial sand would be about 11 dollars .
so , there it is -- architectural anti-desertification structures made from the desert itself .
i first heard this when i was a kid , and i loved it , but i had no idea what it meant .
and i realized that the stories that i was telling were real in this way that was familiar to me and really exciting .
or people go to london and they visit baker street to see sherlock holmes ' apartment , even though 221b is just a number that was painted on a building that never actually had that address .
or eyes , also in lots of colors , just glass eyes , depending on how you want to deal with that situation .
barbarian repellent . it 's full of salad and potpourri — things that barbarians hate .
for me , i kind of prefer the opposite .
he 's got a phone number , and you can call and leave him a message .
his voice is completely different , but he put his babysitter on the phone , and she was very nice to randolph as well .
nearly every year for more than a hundred years , it 's looked like this in the summer .
most of you will be happy to know that the rest of the presentation 's free , and some of you 'll be happy to know that it involves beer .
after all , it is their water right , and if they want to use that water right to help the fish grow in the stream , it 's their right to do so .
and most importantly , it 's working .
in the process , we broke the record for the longest human-powered polar journey in history by more than 400 miles .
so this is the high-water mark of human endurance , human endeavor , human athletic achievement in arguably the harshest climate on earth .
so we had some 21st-century gear , but the reality is that the challenges that scott faced were the same that we faced : those of the weather and of what scott called glide , the amount of friction between the sledges and the snow .
we had , before we 'd got to the pole , two weeks of almost permanent headwind , which slowed us down .
i don 't regret calling for that plane for a second , because i 'm still standing here alive , with all digits intact , telling this story .
i 've put on 30 pounds .
it 's become an art form , a form of sculpture .
the secret to productivity in so many fields -- and in origami -- is letting dead people do your work for you .
this fish , 400 scales -- again , it is one uncut square , only folding .
the last step is not so hard , but that middle step -- going from the abstract description to the folded shape -- that 's hard .
and if i make the flap from the middle , it uses a full circle .
and if you take this crease pattern , you fold on the dotted lines , you 'll get a base that you can then shape into a deer , with exactly the crease pattern that you wanted .
and what this has allowed is the creation of origami-on-demand .
they called it the eyeglass .
the problem that 's being solved here is something that needs to be big and sheet-like at its destination , but needs to be small for the journey .
thanks .
and i think this speaks to a spectrum that goes from complete self-absorption , to noticing , to empathy and to compassion .
i have a brother-in-law who 's an expert on horror and terror -- he wrote the annotated dracula , the essential frankenstein -- he was trained as a chaucer scholar , but he was born in transylvania and i think it affected him a little bit .
we don 't notice and don 't notice that we don 't notice the toxic molecules emitted by a carpet or by the fabric on the seats .
and all of a sudden as i was going down the stairs i noticed that there was a man slumped to the side , shirtless , not moving , and people were just stepping over him -- hundreds and hundreds of people .
the robot i 'm holding in my hand is this one , and it 's been created by two students , alex and daniel .
the one that 's the most important is the inertia or the resistance to motion .
so one of the problems with these small robots is their payload carrying capacity .
here you have overhead motion capture cameras on the top that tell the robot where it is 100 times a second .
there 's no explicit communication .
and despite the aerodynamic interactions of these propeller blades , they 're able to maintain stable flight .
so i want to show you a clip of algorithms developed by frank shen and professor nathan michael that shows this robot entering a building for the very first time and creating this map on the fly .
and of course , it 's made exclusively for ted 2012 .
instead , all they have to do is look up on the list what kind of sentence goes with what kind of crime .
what we desperately need , beyond , or along with , better rules and reasonably smart incentives , is we need virtue .
and in interactions with people , almost all the time , it is this kind of flexibility that is required .
the pennsylvania sentencing guidelines required a minimum sentence for a crime like this of two years , 24 months .
judge forer did what she was required to do , and then she quit the bench .
and second , they demoralize the activity itself .
so canny outlaws are better than nothing , but it 's hard to imagine any canny outlaw sustaining that for an indefinite period of time .
they wanted to do something about what we all know , namely the revolving door of the criminal justice system .
so there are examples like this in medicine -- doctors at harvard who are trying to transform medical education , so that you don 't get a kind of ethical erosion and loss of empathy , which characterizes most medical students in the course of their medical training .
indeed , we argue , there is no substitute for wisdom .
and let me show you what it is that he found .
you know , the force responsible for electricity and magnetic attraction and so forth .
let me show you that one visually .
and the wonderful thing is that superstring theory has nothing to do at first sight with this idea of extra dimensions , but when we study superstring theory , we find that it resurrects the idea in a sparkling , new form .
it 's built up of a huge number of these little tiny filaments of vibrating energy , vibrating in different frequencies .
not yet .
and if you watch these little fellows vibrating around -- they 'll be there in a second -- right there , notice that they way they vibrate is affected by the geometry of the extra dimensions .
and if this experiment bears fruit , if we see that kind of particle ejected by noticing that there 's less energy in our dimensions than when we began , this will show that the extra dimensions are real .
and , more than that , whatever is on your brain should come out of your mouth .
so , i decided to dive in head first , and try to live the bible .
you only know if you try it .
and perhaps the clearest example of this is stoning adulterers .
so i thought i would end by telling you just a couple of the take-aways , the bigger lessons that i learned from my year .
and this one was a big lesson because i was praying , giving these prayers of thanksgiving , which was odd for an agnostic .
but it was interesting because i had some very preconceived notions about , for instance , evangelical christianity , and i found that it 's such a wide and varied movement that it is difficult to make generalizations about it .
and this one i learned because i tried to follow everything in the bible .
but even with a cowboy , about one person a month was killed and run over .
this was after 9 / 11 ; the city was in tough times .
there 's a point , you can stand here and see buildings by frank gehry , jean nouvel , shigeru ban , neil denari .
and it 's an industry which has bucked the current recession with equanimity .
they used to get great apartments in the center of town , casual sex on tap , and they could travel to the west very freely , which was a great luxury at the time .
and what i noticed at the beginning of my research that the balkans had turned into a vast transit zone for illicit goods and services coming from all over the world .
now , let me show you some of my friends in action , caught conveniently on film by the italian police , and smuggling duty-not-paid cigarettes .
in the 1990s , we saw financial centers around the world competing for their business , and there was simply no effective mechanism to prevent money laundering .
the united nations recognized earlier this -- it was last month actually -- that canada has become a key area of distribution and production of ecstasy and other synthetic drugs .
and it 's actually much easier because the fascinating thing about cybercrime is that it 's not so much the technology .
they affect our communications , our pension funds .
that 's just 12 percent of the population .
so let me talk about hydrogen first .
we haven 't seen anything yet in our development work that says that isn 't possible .
i just want to ask one .
now let me take you back as to why we needed to do it .
and then we decided , why not get to religion because in the philippines , the catholic church was pretty strong , and thai people were buddhist .
we had relay races with condoms , we had children 's condom-blowing championship .
and here is this , then , young man called willy bohm who worked for the usaid .
and then we got a new prime minister soon after that .
and they loved him . you need a symbol of something .
why just run around ?
it 's not a free gift .
and then now , finally in education , we want to change the school as being underutilized into a place where it 's a lifelong learning center for everyone .
so what we can do is actually tell you about the molecules , but we don 't really have a direct way of showing you the molecules .
they are actually red ; that 's what gives blood its color .
it 's an accurate representation , and it 's pretty much at the correct speed for what is occurring inside you .
the nuclear envelope breaks down .
we have no idea really as to how it 's achieving that movement .
so again , this is all derived accurately from the science .
and the going is pretty rough right now .
i think that compassion also is often linked to beauty -- and by that i mean a willingness to see beauty in the other , not just what it is about them that might need helping .
the communities that jean vanier founded , like jean vanier himself , exude tenderness .
rachel naomi remen is actually bringing compassion back to its rightful place alongside science in her field of medicine in the training of new doctors .
and when i look at the second , i ask , what kind of person was he ? what kind of man is this ? "
so , i 'm going to start off with kind of the buzzkill a little bit .
now this fundamentally changes the way we respond to disasters , because gone are the horrid conditions inside a sports arena or a gymnasium , where people are crammed on these cots inside .
now , a funny thing started happening .
i thought , god , that is the coolest thing i 've ever seen at an airport .
i took some photos , and this is a billboard in florida , and either they hadn 't paid their rent , or they didn 't want to pay their rent again on the sign , and the billboard people were too cheap to tear the whole sign down , so they just teared out sections of it .
and the more you try to think about it , the further the answer gets from you , and the minute you stop thinking about it , your intuition gives you that answer , in a sense .
" while people are engaged in creating a totally different world , they always form vivid images of the preceding world . "
got no way of tracking it , so i could be totally wrong .
i found out that 's very true , working on this campaign worldwide .
this is an opener for brian eno , and it 's just kind of my personal interpretation of the music .
there were a lot of orphans made this day , and here 's a dead body being brought out .
nobody else can do that : nobody else can pull from your background , from your parents , your upbringing , your whole life experience .
and as teachers , after you get all the answers , you like to give them the correct answer .
they 're charismatic .
the main star is an enzyme called luciferase , which in the course of evolution has figured out a way to wrap its tiny arms around an even smaller molecule called luciferin , in the process getting it so excited that it actually gives off light .
well , they 're lounging down below surveying their options .
firefly romance is risky .
yet every time a species is lost , it 's like extinguishing a room full of candles one by one .
the chairs are on the tables and still drinking , and he drinks a lot .
and this is an articulated bus , double-articulated .
and before you say it 's a norman foster design , we designed this in ' 83 .
and these are the references from our ethnic contribution .
ok ?
and maybe i 'm just a storyteller .
because , by the time you 're a social worker for 10 years , what you realize is that connection is why we 're here .
and so i thought , this is my chance to beat it back with my measuring stick .
so i had a manila folder , and i had a sharpie , and i was like , what am i going to call this research ?
they thought this was fundamental .
she said , " what 's going on ? "
it was a slugfest .
i don 't want to feel these .
there 's no discourse anymore .
we do that corporate -- whether it 's a bailout , an oil spill , a recall -- we pretend like what we 're doing doesn 't have a huge impact on other people .
so in the morning , you see which direction the sunflower is facing , and you mark it on the blank area in the base .
to do this , i devised something called the five senses graph .
it would , of course , be a horizontal line along the top .
all right , next .
i figured he was either really on to something , or he was one of these academic nutcases .
we have about 200,000 different varieties of wheat , and we have about 2 to 400,000 different varieties of rice , but it 's being lost .
and the fowler apple is described in here -- i hope this doesn 't surprise you -- as , " a beautiful fruit . "
the coldest growing seasons of the future , hotter than the hottest of the past .
we have to get climate-ready crops in the field , and we have to do that rather quickly .
what you see is an artist 's conception of this facility , which is built in a mountain in svalbard .
this is a backup system for world agriculture .
the svalbard global seed vault is a wonderful gift that norway and others have given us , but it 's not the complete answer .
and if you want to go faster , say on pavement , you can shift to a high gear , and you get less torque , but higher speeds .
now , when you want to use the lfc indoors , all you have to do is pull the levers out of the drivetrain , stow them in the frame , and it converts into a normal wheelchair that you can use just like any other normal wheelchair , and we sized it like a normal wheelchair , so it 's narrow enough to fit through a standard doorway , it 's low enough to fit under a table , and it 's small and maneuverable enough to fit in a bathroom and this is important so the user can get up close to a toilet , and be able to transfer off just like he could in a normal wheelchair .
and then you can also engage the end user in the design process , and not just ask him what he needs , but ask him how he thinks it can be achieved .
so how do we do that ?
these were all undetected by normal thresholds which would be applied to data .
it 's telling us that something is going wrong .
no , i don 't do that ; i 'm a conjurer , who is someone who pretends to be a real magician .
i have to do something now , which seems a little bit strange for a magician .
you might agree with me on that .
is this a hunting game ?
it was a game of hunting questions like this .
because , the bottom line is , the sponsors love it , and he will expose her to television publicity all the time .
and we haven 't heard from her since . strange .
six and a half days , that certainly is a fatal dose .
i don 't know what we 're doing , believing in all this nonsense over all these years .
we really must do something about this .
this red dot marks the great basin of north america , and i 'm involved with an alpine biodiversity project there with some collaborators .
when you look at this orb web , you 're actually seeing many types of silk fibers .
and the most studied silk line of them all : major ampullate silk .
this makes testing spider silk really , really easy to do in the laboratory , because we 're actually , you know , testing it in air that 's exactly the environment that spiders are using their silk proteins .
what you see here on this toughness graph is the higher the black dot is on the graph , the higher the toughness .
that 's just the best .
so let 's move forward .
if you 're leaning forward , he will try and slightly change the neuro-linguistic nature of his face , because we went out with this strong idea : how can we make you believe that something 's real ?
what we 're using there is , we 're using something , a piece of technology called tellme .
try hitting the boat .
now is the time when we open that portal and allow you to talk to milo .
the cool thing is that we 're doing as well : as you interact with him , you 're able to put things into his world ; he recognizes objects .
and you 'll see , just now , a nurse coming back to the tray , which is their sort of modular station , and dropping the syringe she 's just used back in the tray for it to be picked up and used again .
so we need a better product . and we need better information .
and that 's important because you can 't fix what you can 't see .
we 've launched them .
this is not an animation , this is a video taken by the astronaut looking out of the window .
and the image on the left is from our satellite , and we see buildings are being built .
and we believe that together , we can help to take care of our spaceship earth .
but there 's also a scientific reason that drove this project , which was to use this natural longitudinal data to understand the process of how a child learns language -- that child being my son .
and so we started to analyze why .
what i 'm going to do is give you an accelerated view of 30 minutes , again , of just life in the living room .
and what this data leaves in its wake is a landscape .
you have the event structure , the common ground that the words are about , coming out of the television feeds ; you 've got the conversations that are about those topics ; and through semantic analysis -- and this is actually real data you 're looking at from our data processing -- each yellow line is showing a link being made between a comment in the wild and a piece of event structure coming out of the television signal .
they talk to other people .
and just as i was having that thought , he looked up at me and said , " so that when i grow up , i can show this to my kids ? "
and then the pilot didn 't go and i was so sad , but i kept remaining a fan of yours .
do you guys know about that movie " the secret " ?
i thought about that for quite a spell , and i wanted to come up with my own definition . i thought that might help .
that made an impression on me in the 1930s .
so that was the ideas that i tried to get across to the youngsters under my supervision .
when you get older , it doesn 't make any difference . " but -- so i did believe on time . i believe starting on time , and i believe closing on time .
and we forget there is no progress without change .
and so the fates are seldom wrong , no matter how they twist and wind .
i 'd like to go up and sit in the stands and watch the players play , and see whether i 'd done a decent job during the week .
and i thought , " oh gracious , if these two players , either one of them " -- they were different years , but i thought about each one at the time he was there -- " oh , if he ever makes the varsity , our varsity must be pretty miserable , if he 's good enough to make it . "
it 's a valley where , in a long day , perhaps , too , you can follow the tracks of grizzly and wolf and drink from the very sources of water that gave rise and cradled the great civilizations of the northwest coast .
at the headwaters itself , shell canada has plans to extract methane gas from coal seams that underly a million acres , fracking the coal with hundreds of millions of gallons of toxic chemicals , establishing perhaps as many as 6,000 wellheads , and eventually a network of roads and pipelines and flaring wellheads , all to generate methane gas that most likely will go east to fuel the expansion of the tar sands .
six years ago , after 20 years in graphic design and typography , i changed the way i was working and the way most graphic designers work to pursue a more personal approach to my work , with only the humble attempt to simply make a living doing something that i loved .
this is a piece that i did for the guardian newspaper in the u.k.
and eventually i used this technique to create a piece of artwork .
this book is taking rather a long time , but i 'm nearly done .
and i specifically wrote four pages that don 't connect .
i don 't have that much else to say , but they turned out really well .
so that 's why i do what i do , and why i spend so much time and effort on it , and why i work in the commercial , public sphere , as opposed to the isolated , private sphere of fine art : because i want as many people as possible to see my work , notice it , be drawn into it , and be able to take something from it .
it really struck me , and i wanted to do something about this .
so the combination of source and filter is how we produce speech .
we 're going to call this database a voice bank .
i 'll never forget the gentle smile that spread across her face when she heard that voice for the first time .
imagine that .
we miss out on the things that are most important to us , and the crazy thing is that everybody just assumes , well , that 's the way life is , so we 've just kind of got to get on with it .
it taught me -- it gave me a greater appreciation , an understanding for the present moment .
at other times , we might take our foot off the gas a little bit too much , and things just become a sort of little bit like this .
well , whatever it is , meditation offers the opportunity , the potential to step back and to get a different perspective , to see that things aren 't always as they appear .
most people think it 's land mines , but it 's a vehicle accident .
and we 've been able to develop a knee , a polycentric knee , so that type of knee that acts like a human knee , mimics human gait , for 80 dollars retail .
we see that they squat . they kneel in prayer .
so i 'm going to show you some of the modifications we did .
right now , our knees are worn in 12 countries .
we started experimenting , as you can see , in terms of shapes , forms . the scale became very important , and it 's become our pet project . it 's successful , it 's been running for 12 years . and we supply the conran shops , and donna karan , and so it 's kind of great .
and this gives me enormous hope .
i can 't tell you how reassured i was by the very last sentence in that glorious presentation by dean kamen a few days ago .
now , it 's about five , six , seven , eight pages long , and it gets kind of deep and difficult after about the third page , but somewhere on the second page he begins talking about the notion that he calls " moral imagination . "
and we have had examples over and over and over again -- you 've just heard one in the last 15 minutes -- of people who have not only had that commitment , but had the charisma , the brilliance -- and i think in this room it 's easy to use the word brilliant , my god -- the brilliance to succeed at least at the beginning of their quest , and who no doubt will continue to succeed , as long as more and more of us enlist ourselves in their cause .
but a few years ago , i noticed a disturbing trend in leadership preparation .
who are you spending time with ? on what topics ?
they 're often people that think differently and therefore are willing to join you in taking a courageous leap .
they were too busy building a family and a country .
and this is the great team that helped us make it happen .
" i did the coursework because understanding computers is important to me , just like literacy and numeracy , and i made it through . i never worked harder on anything , never been challenged to this degree .
moving along , what about the area of this figure ?
the most important thing is to be a mensch . "
and the aquarium had a lot of big fish tanks but not a lot of invertebrate displays , and being the spineless guy , i thought , well i 'll just go out in the field and collect these wonderful animals i had been learning about as a student and bring them in , and i built these elaborate sets and put them on display .
yeah , i 'll be a filmmaker . "
and one of the most fantastic displays that i remember , or at least visually , was a foraging behavior .
and finally , it 's a rich lavender , and after a couple of thousand feet , it 's ink black .
and this whole ecosystem wasn 't even known about until 33 years ago .
there 's no coral , algae growing on it , and the water 's pea soup .
i 'm a big fan of grassroots organizations .
in theory , we 're thinking , rational human beings .
finally , in about the sixteenth century , a physician whose name was theophrastus bombastus aureolus von hohenheim , called paracelsus , a name probably familiar to some people here -- -- good , old paracelsus found that he could predict the degree of convulsion by using a measured amount of camphor to produce the convulsion .
he said , " this fellow " -- remember , he wasn 't even put to sleep -- " after this major grand mal convulsion , sat right up , looked at these three fellas and said , ' what the fuck are you assholes trying to do ? ' " if i could only say that in italian .
i 'm telling you this story , because actually ever since richard called me and asked me to talk about -- as he asked all of his speakers -- to talk about something that would be new to this audience , that we had never talked about , never written about , i 've been planning this moment .
that proved to be a lot of bovine stercus .
well , i was a grown man who had all of these rituals , and it got so there was a throbbing , there was a ferocious fear in my head .
eight didn 't work . at nine , i noticed -- and it 's wonderful that i could notice anything -- i noticed a change . and at 10 , i noticed a real change .
i brought my wife with me , actually , to make sure i could get through this .
so one of the reasons that i have come here to talk about this today is to -- frankly , selfishly -- unburden myself and let it be known that this is not an untroubled mind that has written all of these books .
it 's the pathfinder that shows us a simple road through an impenetrable moral maze .
let 's go there and make love . in the tent . "
it 's our home . we welcome them .
if he beat , we will put [ him ] in jail , and we will call the eldest people .
talk to me about your decision , dr. abdi , and your decision , dr. mohamed , to work together -- for you to become a doctor and to work with your mother in these circumstances .
and to go back and to work with our mother is just what we saw in the civil war -- when i was 16 , and my sister was 11 , when the civil war broke out .
it is not like beautiful offices here , 20 patients , you 're tired .
dare i admit that after she did it i never really loved her again ?
her cats , god knows how many , who must piss on her rugs -- her landing 's a sickening reek .
too many lives in our lives already , too many chances for sorrow , too many unaccounted-for pasts .
many -- most of my poems actually are urban poems . i happen to be reading a bunch that aren 't .
a student , a young woman in a fourth-floor hallway of her lycee , perched on the ledge of an open window chatting with friends between classes ; a teacher passes and chides her , " be careful , you might fall , " almost banteringly chides her , " you might fall , " and the young woman , 18 , a girl really , though she wouldn 't think that , as brilliant as she is , first in her class , and " beautiful , too , " she 's often told , smiles back , and leans into the open window , which wouldn 't even be open if it were winter -- if it were winter someone would have closed it -- leans into the window , farther , still smiling , farther and farther , though it takes less time than this , really an instant , and lets herself fall .
always that erotic murmur , i 'm hardly myself if i 'm not in a state of incipient desire .
and not having to know history 's next mad rage or regression , it might be a relief .
actually it was a very hard challenge .
it 's like the heart of the suburb in rio .
and it 's something that we 're doing , again , lots in rio .
moving to the third commandment .
bring infrastructure to the favelas , to the slums , wherever you are .
but the reason i could come here is because of that .
now it 's 11 : 00 pm in rio .
but everything that i said here tonight , or the commandments , are means , are ways , for us to govern cities -- invest in infrastructure , invest in the green , open parks , open spaces , integrate socially , use technology .
but i think the point is that this is metaphor with teeth , and it 's with those teeth that i want to propose today that we rethink a little bit about the role of contemporary math -- not just financial math , but math in general .
what do you do when you grow up ? "
nobody had any control over what was actually happening .
and so netflix has gone through several different algorithms over the years .
these are two different cleaning robots that have very different ideas about what clean means .
because the algorithms of wall street are dependent on one quality above all else , which is speed .
it involves light cones and quantum entanglement , and i don 't really understand any of that .
following three years of work in somalia , i got picked up by the world health organization , and got assigned to the epidemics of aids .
and i asked the question , what are you doing about it ?
what does the data look like ?
and that combination of factors is how the aids epidemic in uganda was very successfully reversed .
we got a lot of criticism , a lot of opposition , and a lot of opponents .
and recently , the institute of medicine came out with a workshop report which went through some of the data , including the neuroscience , on how this problem is really transmitted .
by the time i was 18 , i had a deep passion for books .
and what transpired was that people had put forward a hypothesis that was apparently coming up with some fabulous results by about 1995 .
do you go to a restaurant ?
i 'm working a lot with motion and animation , and also i 'm an old dj and a musician .
i got a scholarship , went to university , studied international agriculture , studied anthropology , and decided i was going to give back .
" i make ice cream . "
we needed to be working on lumber .
if we were farmers , we 'd be eating our seed .
but that 's what the math says .
better than lamb produced in new zealand , frozen and shipped to the u.k. ?
even if we get everybody working on it , we 've got to be strategic .
and if you go through the first 25 or 30 names of each of the commodities , what you begin to see is , gosh , there 's cargill here , there 's cargill there , there 's cargill everywhere .
it 's not all fun and games .
one company we 're working with that 's begun -- in baby steps , perhaps -- but has begun this journey on sustainability is cargill .
what they 've realized is that if they can identify the traits on productivity and drought tolerance , they can produce 320 percent as much cocoa on 40 percent of the land .
we have to really begin to change the way we think about everything .
was that nice ?
something must be wrong there , yeah ? but he 's spreading happiness .
you have to sing " aaaaaah , " and i 'll stop you .
you 're using us as instruments , not as partners .
let 's see another super-conductor , a german super-conductor . herbert von karajan , please .
now that 's great . what about the eyes ?
but how does it really work together if it doesn 't give them instructions ?
again you see the beautiful body language .
it 's not feedback . it 's an " mmmm ... " yeah , it comes from here .
and you look at lenny and he 's suffering .
and this is a business incubator .
we 're all focusing on — this is a statistic from earlier this month in the financial times — we 're all focusing on the luxury economy .
one in seven africans is a nigerian , and so everyone wants in to the mobile phone market in nigeria . and when mtn came in , they wanted to sell the mobile service like i get in the united states or like people get here in the u.k. or in europe -- expensive monthly plans , you get a phone , you pay overages , you 're killed with fees -- and their plan crashed and burned .
now , businesses tend to complain about this , and their , they , i don 't want to take away from their entire validity of complaining about it , but i did ask a major sneaker manufacturer earlier this year what they thought about piracy , and they told me , " well , you can 't quote me on this , because if you quote me on this , i have to kill you , " but they use piracy as market research .
but what normally preoccupied them also involved yearning to know .
or so we should hope .
it did help by promoting observation and experiment .
and the evidence for evolution ?
any crank claiming the sun will go out next tuesday has got a testable prediction .
that accounts for the same phenomena as the original myth .
it 's the basic regulating principle of the enlightenment .
there 's a new moon on the horizon .
it 's the home of my mentor .
their canoes , our rockets ; their sea , our space .
and what he meant was , if you are voyaging and far from home , your very survival depends on everyone aboard .
restorative seafood allows for an evolving and dynamic system and acknowledges our relationship with the ocean as a resource , suggesting that we engage to replenish the ocean and to encourage its resiliency .
well , how many bottles is it before you tell me that i have a problem ?
there 's a pattern here .
it 's about the way that we look at our plates .
start with a 16-ounce portion of big fish .
it 's pretty straightforward .
leonardo da vinci 's exquisitely soulful image of the " lady with an ermine . "
again , i 'd been there a couple of years before , but on that particular visit .
it 's such an extraordinarily artificial color .
so , there i was -- in a sort of paroxysm of horror .
imagine that effect of candlelight on that surface .
we 've eliminated , in a sense , that constant of the imagination that these vases represented in people 's lives .
in a way that i think would have been impossible without the pink sèvres vase in my leonardo days .
i 'm going to trap mockingbirds all across the nation and put them gently into mason jars like mockingbird molotov cocktails .
i 'll line the bottom with old notebook pages .
wait for the man with the mockingbird . "
this a photograph of the desktop of a student of mine .
anyone want to hazard a guess ?
but jaap is one of the world experts in performing it .
in the first one which i 'm going to show you , called eyecode , it 's a piece of interactive software in which , if we read this little circle , " the trace left by the looking of the previous observer looks at the trace left by the looking of previous observer . "
so that 's this kind of recursive observation system .
and the idea is basically , can it look at you and make you feel as if like , " what ? is it my shoes ? "
you have to have dosimeter at all times , clicking away , you have to have a government minder , and there 's draconian radiation rules and constant contamination monitoring .
she 's the self-declared mayor of kapavati village , population eight .
now everybody agrees that thyroid cancers are sky high , and that chernobyl evacuees suffer the trauma of relocated peoples everywhere : higher levels of anxiety , depression , alcoholism , unemployment and , importantly , disrupted social networks .
hi , my name is marcin -- farmer , technologist .
and i found that industrial productivity can be achieved on a small scale .
well , i was born with a rare visual condition called achromatopsia , which is total color blindness , so i 've never seen color , and i don 't know what color looks like , because i come from a grayscale world .
so , life has changed dramatically since i hear color , because color is almost everywhere , so the biggest change for example is going to an art gallery , i can listen to a picasso , for example . so it 's like i 'm going to a concert hall , because i can listen to the paintings .
some people , i would never relate , but they sound similar .
i was able to differentiate all the degrees of the color wheel .
what we still do perhaps too often .
and not just that . there 's james . he 's an architect and he 's a professor , and he loves place-making , and place-making is when you have those mini-plazas and those urban walkways and where they 're dotted with art , where people draw and come up and talk sometimes .
it calls on us , each of us , to a higher calling .
i truly believe , in my firsthand experience , the world is hungry for us to unite together as opportunity-makers and to emulate those behaviors as so many of you already do — i know that firsthand — and to reimagine a world where we use our best talents together more often to accomplish greater things together than we could on our own .
but i 'm going to talk about l.a. ' s water issues right now .
when we visited , it gave some of the people we were with this strange little cough after being only there for just a few hours or so -- not just miners , but everybody .
but her dream of coal river mountain wind is her legacy .
and we know that eco-industrial business , these kinds of business models -- there 's a model in europe called the eco-industrial park , where either the waste of one company is the raw material for another , or you use recycled materials to make goods that you can actually use and sell .
and we want to shift the systems that open the doors for people who were formerly tax burdens to become part of the tax base .
i recently read a book called " love leadership " by john hope bryant .
but during that time , i realized that it was about projects and developing them on the local level that really was going to do the right thing for our communities .
thank you very much .
so as of today , it 's finished . i 'd like to say that i planned that for ted , but i didn 't . so it 's been completed as of today .
the quarks , these pink things , are the things that make up protons and neutrons that make up the atomic nuclei in your body .
ok , we 've discovered the particles , but unless you understand the underlying reason for that pattern -- you know , why it 's built the way it is -- really you 've done stamp collecting . you haven 't done science .
higgs particles have not been discovered .
the picture is that the electrons and the quarks in your body and in the universe that we see around us are heavy , in a sense , and massive , because they 're surrounded by higgs particles .
so a very compelling theory that 's really mainstream physics .
they then re-collapsed into another generation of stars and planets .
i thought , at the time , i did a pretty good job .
now , what brunel said that he wanted to achieve for his passengers was the experience of floating across the countryside .
and as we see this reemergence of design thinking and we see it beginning to tackle new kinds of problems , there are some basic ideas that i think we can observe that are useful .
now , they are very efficient , but they are also very innovative .
through a program of observational research , brainstorming new solutions and rapid prototyping , they 've developed a completely new way to change shift .
what 's the design brief ?
and if you 've got any ideas then feel free , you can post them to twitter .
many barriers are breaking down .
and you can create parts with moving components , hinges , parts within parts .
again , not buildable in any other way .
and in fact , as the detail is improving , the quality is improving , the price of the machines are falling and they 're becoming quicker .
which means that we can now present to the public the next generation of customization .
i don 't think that will happen soon .
so one of the pioneers , for example , is dr. anthony atala , and he has been working on layering cells to create body parts -- bladders , valves , kidneys .
hc : delicious .
hc : so , after about a day of chris and i staring at each other , we came up with something that was pretty close to the hamburger patty , and as you can see it basically forms like hamburger meat .
let 's charge them a boatload of cash for this and see what they think .
so the flaws are the key .
ha ha .
so that 's a chunk of what we 're looking for .
and it was a big christmas hit .
and she had this really awesome idea to sell the bag called the " feed bag " -- which is really beautifully ironic because you can strap on the feed bag .
it 's actually been spreading all around the world and mainly through our kind of food systems that we 're exporting .
and most of those people are women -- which is a totally other topic that i won 't get on right now , but i 'd love to do the feminist thing at some point .
so that 's the first birthday i want to talk about .
and i also think that thinking about processed foods in a new way , where we actually price the negative externalities like petrochemicals and like fertilizer runoff into the price of a bag of chips .
and we learned a few things about how to have a good end .
a lot of people say , " if i get like that , just shoot me . "
we went through a number of not-quite-right caregivers before we found the perfect team led by marsha , who won 't let you win at bingo just because you 're dying but will go out and take videos of your ranch for you when you can 't get out there , and caitlin , who won 't let you skip your morning exercises but knows when you need to hear that your wife is in good hands .
every world has an alien , and every alien world has a flying saucer , and they move about with great speed . aliens .
i mean , there we are .
and very soon after , the fossil record started yielding a very good idea of how many plants and animals there have been since complex life really began to leave a very interesting fossil record .
the most recent , the permian , was thought to have been an impact because of this beautiful structure on the right .
hold still , you 're the scale .
and the what , i think , is that we returned , over and over again , to the pre-cambrian world , that first microbial age , and the microbes are still out there .
this led lee kump , and others from penn state and my group , to propose what i call the kump hypothesis : many of the mass extinctions were caused by lowering oxygen , by high co2 . and the worst effect of global warming , it turns out : hydrogen sulfide being produced out of the oceans .
we know hydrogen sulfide is erupting presently a few places on the planet .
i got this email from him two years ago ; he said , " i think i 've got an answer to some of your questions . "
give us a few millennia -- and we humans should last those few millennia -- will it happen again ? if we continue , it 'll happen again .
the discovery that had led to penicillin , for example , is one of the most fortunate accidents of all time .
you see , plastics have very complex structures and are difficult to biodegrade .
everything went well from there , and we became amazing scientists .
i know some of you in the crowd are thinking , well , carbon dioxide is horrible , it 's a greenhouse gas .
you know , there 's also something called the " complete idiot 's guide ? "
so , i opened up this tv guide thing , and on the e ! channel , this " simple life " show is very popular .
and some of you guys are entrepreneurs , etc . , whatever .
but the media lab is an interesting place , and it 's important to me because as a student , i was a computer science undergrad , and i discovered design later on in my life .
the t doesn 't stand for " human , " it stands for " technology . "
this is why they have fireworks in the summer .
so , to get off the tree , i began to use my old computers .
so , i wanted to play with cheetos in some way .
so , i thought , maybe i 'll do this for the next twenty years or something .
i think this is sort of simple more versus less .
so , as you get older , you may , like , have kids , whatever .
taking them off the dead , flat pages .
gerard manley hopkins , a saintly man .
well , you 've been so ... that 's innovative , don 't you think ?
why do i believe this ?
the take the fun out of marriage act .
you want to see what hurts ?
how can we get men to talk about violence against women and girls ?
we just do . we have to .
this is part of the amazon basin , a place called rondônia in the south-center part of the brazilian amazon .
the second area , in brown , is the world 's pastures and rangelands , where our animals live .
the reason it 's here is because , on the right-hand side , you see two little rivers kind of coming down through the sand , feeding this basin with water .
nineteen of the unique 20 fish species found only in the aral sea are now wiped off the face of the earth .
so without a doubt , agriculture is the single most powerful force unleashed on this planet since the end of the ice age . no question .
the green areas here show where corn yields , just showing corn as an example , are already really high , probably the maximum you could find on earth today for that climate and soil , but the brown areas and yellow areas are places where we 're only getting maybe 20 or 30 percent of the yield you should be able to get .
today , we 're nearing 7 billion people .
look at the aral sea , now turned to desert .
we need collaboration , imagination , determination , because failure is not an option .
it runs out of space .
and that 's what i 'm going to describe to you today .
but it 's not just a symphony of perception .
and we did that for tens of thousands of neurons , built digital models of all the different types of neurons we came across .
we can look at the fabric . and we can change neurons .
so you need 10,000 laptops .
and if you do that , you will be able to step inside the reality that is created by this machine , by this piece of the brain .
from the photosynthetic growth , it would take 500 years of that growth to produce what we use , the 30 billion barrels we use per year .
i don 't believe that , and i think the situation is changing .
we have selves .
but sometime ago , through the help of an opthamologist colleague of mine , carmen puliafito , who developed a laser scanner of the retina , i found out the the following .
the self is really the elusive problem .
however , there is a close , permanently maintained bond between the body regulating parts of my brain and my own body .
look at " cerebral cortex , " look at " brain stem , " look at " body , " and you get the picture of the interconnectivity in which you have the brain stem providing the grounding for the self in a very tight interconnection with the body .
and the autobiographical self has prompted extended memory , reasoning , imagination , creativity and language .
one of the threads that seems to have come through loud and clear in the last couple of days is this need to reconcile what the big wants -- the " big " being the organization , the system , the country -- and what the " small " wants -- the individual , the person .
we showed them the whole cut , and they were all completely , what is this ?
it 's what i do for a living , sort of laurence llewelyn-bowen .
again , another medical example here .
people consciously follow things even though , why , we don 't know .
we all talk to one another in this highly visual way without realizing what we 're doing .
and putting yourself in the position of the person , and i think that 's one of the threads that i 've heard again from this conference is how do we put ourselves in other peoples ' shoes and really feel what they feel ?
so we actually managed to reconcile the needs of the design company , the needs of the individuals in the company , to feel good about a product we were actually designing , and the needs of the individuals we were designing it for .
the entire world 's peoples will be unified in this paradise on earth and live happily ever after .
george h.w. bush : a new world order ...
entrepreneurs are starting companies every day .
one thing we often hear is , " political reforms have lagged far behind economic reforms , " and " china is in dire need of political reform . "
it operates a rotating pyramid made up of three components : civil service , state-owned enterprises , and social organizations like a university or a community program .
in essence , the organization department runs a modernized version of china 's centuries-old mentoring system .
those who think they 're better off than five years ago : 70 percent .
transparency international ranks china between 70 and 80 in recent years among 170 countries , and it 's been moving up .
china 's political model will never supplant electoral democracy , because unlike the latter , it doesn 't pretend to be universal .
the chinese government .
very soon they 'll be doing everything for us .
but i want to show you a different approach , and this is this robot over here , which has four legs .
they begin to self-replicate . so in absence of any reward , the intrinsic reward is self-replication .
spectroscopy , that was another one .
but you do meet some fantastic people , people who look at the world in a totally different way .
: " global problems require scottish solutions . "
but the people , when talking about the finance industry , he said , " what you as the city of london have done for financial services , we , as a government , hope to do for the economy as a whole . "
it 's certainly something he can relate to .
you like that one ? as opposed to you could see george bush , well , what 's the metaphor there ?
and he and the chief justice , they trip over each other , they get their words wrong and they screw the thing up .
do you remember that ? george bush , " a nu-ca-ler . "
mandela , the great man mandela .
and what i want to talk about today is how we can help more people like my dad , because we have to change the way we think about raising money to fund cancer research .
in other words , are the side effects just so severe that no matter how much good it does , it 's not going to be worth it ?
in finance , we know what to do with assets that are risky .
we spent the next two years doing research .
and that was really effective , because people that didn 't believe our assumptions could try their own assumptions and see how it would work .
i happened to look out the window , and hand on my heart , i looked out the window on the night of this conference -- it was the summertime -- and that 's what i saw , it was a double rainbow .
i was very eager to be useful in the world -- i think we all have that feeling .
i stopped listening to their stories quite as closely as i had before .
dr. yunus shared his story , explaining what that was , and what he had done with his grameen bank .
maybe they could afford a lock for the door and feel secure .
the money came in basically overnight .
maybe they 're smiling , and they want to talk to you about what they 've done .
so with that in mind , this particular incident has led to the things that i 'm working on now .
as investors choose to become involved based on those terms , they can either take their rewards back as cash , or they can decide in advance to give those returns away to a non-profit .
and i believe more and more every time i listen in that that person 's potential to do great things in the world and in my own potential to maybe help .
and i think you matter .
good for you .
so , what is it for ?
and you are responsible -- that 's my worldview .
in fact , personally , i 've never met a priest or a pastor or a minister who does it for money .
i meet people all the time who have those , and they 're not necessarily happy .
when you read this prayer , it sounds incredibly selfish , self-centered .
i have a church full of ceos and scientists .
it 's not just , " wow , isn 't that cool ? "
and the third thing : it 's a symbol of his influence .
and i guess that 's the main reason i came up here today , to all of you very bright people at ted , is to say , " what 's in your hand ? "
some people have the misguided idea that god only gets excited when you 're doing , quote , " spiritual things , " like going to church or helping the poor , or , you know , confessing or doing something like that .
but they don 't exist . so i 'm having to make them .
so what we 're trying to do is , we 're trying to push these technologies towards creating bottom-up construction approaches for architecture , which contrast the current , victorian , top-down methods which impose structure upon matter .
and architect christian kerrigan has come up with a series of designs that show us how it may be possible to actually grow a limestone reef underneath the city .
this is terrestrial chemistry . we 've all got it , which means that this technology is just as appropriate for developing countries as it is for first world countries .
hundreds have been killed , and more than 100,000 displaced , including many ethnic uzbeks who fled to neighboring uzbekistan .
what is also important is to note that these figures only tell part of the story .
central among them , a commitment to exclusively peaceful means .
a final example : kosovo .
institutional design requires a keen focus on issues , innovative thinking and flexible and well-funded implementation .
and the idea of using technology is perfect for us .
so for the cost of a house -- or around here , a garage -- you can put , you can have spinning all of the words in the library of congress .
it costs about three dollars to download , print and bind a normal , old book .
there are some newer technologies for delivering that have happened that are actually quite exciting as well .
the lesson we learned out of this is , scan your own books .
people seem to love it .
exactly what loaning means , i 'm not quite sure .
this doesn 't make any sense .
we started recording 20 channels of television 24 hours a day .
and we 've made a wayback machine that you can then go and see old websites kind of the way they were .
carnegie -- one of the great capitalists of this country -- carved above his legacy , " free to the people . "
in its essence , the orchestra and the choir are much more than artistic structures .
in the personal / social circle , the children in the orchestras and choirs develop their intellectual and emotional side .
from the minute a child 's taught how to play an instrument , he 's no longer poor .
this is a newspaper ad .
a restaurant -- you might not want to just read about it , maybe you want to go to the restaurant .
it 's voluntary .
but we can change all those things i mentioned .
but maybe if i cut a hole in his head i can fix it . "
you had to have quite a flair for the dramatic , and be really , really quick .
these surgeries were actually now being effective .
they had to give up intuitive motion in the instruments .
you 've got these technologies -- thank you -- and so you might say , " wow this is really cool !
what if we could bring all the instruments in together in one place ?
we need to see beyond the surface .
so , with the combination of these technologies we can reach it all , and we can see it all .
most african stories these days , they talk about famine , hiv and aids , poverty or war .
walk up to it and smack it on the backside . "
because it was wartime , the british .303 rifle was just all over the whole country .
" eh ? the poachers ? "
they were not people from outside .
don 't walk out at night !
we were successful in namibia because we dreamed of a future that was much more than just a healthy wildlife .
we set out a clear action plan with goals and benchmarks .
and i work for a data-driven mayor , as you probably know .
it was about those lawn chairs .
we 've repurposed 26 acres of active car lanes and turned them into new pedestrian space .
the green line is the number of bike lanes .
in the past , it looked like the guy on the left , ninja-clad bike messenger .
so we underestimate our likelihood of suffering from cancer , being in a car accident .
and it doesn 't mean that we think things will magically turn out okay , but rather that we have the unique ability to make it so .
it 's quite widespread .
then he said , " how much are you willing to pay to get a kiss from a celebrity if the kiss was delivered immediately , in three hours , in 24 hours , in three days , in one year , in 10 years ?
they 're actually more realistic than healthy individuals .
so cancer , for example , is about 30 percent .
so if someone said , " my likelihood of suffering from cancer is 50 percent , " and we said , " hey , good news .
we were quite amazed by these results because we were able to eliminate a deep-rooted bias in humans .
and this is good because it means we should be able to strike a balance , to come up with plans and rules to protect ourselves from unrealistic optimism , but at the same time remain hopeful .
i thought it would be neat to do that . and so i got up in the ceiling and i cut through the ceiling joists , much to my parents ' delight , and put the door , you know , being pulled up through the ceiling .
in some sense , you would become someone else in that journey , because there wouldn 't be -- you 'd leave society and life as you know it , behind .
we 're very sensitive to that as humans .
it 's also more memorable if i show you that picture , and i show you c-h-a-i-r on a piece of paper .
so let me stop there and bring john back , and maybe we can just have a longer conversation .
we finally gave up , took it out of the code .
and then the second one is -- if they feel like it , and they 're not going to do it in every case , but in many they are -- they want to actually be able to sell that creation as a way of providing for their own livelihood .
that said , the evolution of , and the nuanced interaction that creates culture , is happening at 10 times the speed of the real world , and in an environment where , if you walk into a bar in second life , 65 percent of the people there are not in the united states , and in fact are speaking their , you know , various and different languages .
they tend to be creative . they tend to be entrepreneurial .
pr : well , i 'd say a couple of things .
so the police took a picture of titus , they put it in a photo lineup , they later showed it to the victim , and she pointed to titus ' photo .
he spent every waking moment thinking about it , and just days before he was to have his day in court , he woke up in the morning , doubled over in pain , and died of a stress-related heart attack .
i did my experiments that involved showing people simulated crimes and accidents and asking them questions about what they remember .
and what i found is that most of these situations involved some particular form of psychotherapy .
even though i 'd never mentioned her name , she sued me for defamation and invasion of privacy .
and i appreciate that . i feel that way too .

no to killing , in this case no to killing men of religion , because sheikh ahmed adina refaat was shot on december 16th , during a demonstration , leaving behind three orphans and a widow .
and in my lab , i was studying the widower effect , which is a very old idea in the social sciences , going back 150 years , known as " dying of a broken heart . "
so my first topic with respect to this , was not death , but obesity .
and it 's only when you get to your friend 's friend 's friend 's friends that there 's no longer a relationship between that person 's body size and your own body size .
was weight gain in one person actually spreading to weight gain in another person ?
i mean , there would be an advantage to experiencing our emotions inside , you know , anger or happiness .
and if you look at this image , you can right away see clusters of happy and unhappy people , again , spreading to three degrees of separation .
now , those people both have four friends , but a 's friends all know each other , and b 's friends do not .
and so some people knit together the networks around them , creating a kind of dense web of ties in which they 're comfortably embedded .
superorganisms have properties that cannot be understood just by studying the individuals .
the first one is mass .
it 's also useful if you want to put it down on your nightstand to watch a movie or use as an alarm clock , it stands .
and i think making it physical is a good way to do that .
and that got me thinking about a website that i had learned about a few months prior called change.org.
but then i started to realize something .
and my mother , brave lady , was partly to blame , taking me to the new york natural history museum , buying me books on snakes , and then starting this infamous career of mine , which has culminated in of course , arriving in india 60 years ago , brought by my mother , doris norden , and my stepfather , rama chattopadhyaya .
it was very important for us to get through to the people .
we 're still trying to explain and come to terms with what is the evolutionary advantage of this .
and what do we do ? how do we respond to this ?
i mean , just incredible to see bunches of gharial basking on the river again .
just downriver from the chambal is the filthy yamuna river , the sacred yamuna river .
and climate change is certainly going to turn all of our theories and predictions on their heads .
thanks , rom . thanks a lot .
now , the nusha means the high .
i have worked on this for over 14 years , and i can tell you , the results are very good .
my journalism is about hard core evidence .
the officer who earlier denied involvement pecks a calculator to compute the amount of money they will charge on the cocoa to be smuggled .
it is something that if you narrate it to somebody , the person wouldn 't believe it .
aa sure . you know , undercover is all about setting the priorities right , so we got people to take me to court .
these , to me , are like living sculptures , right , that you can go and look at , and they memorialize a specific point of time in this animal 's life .
you , like the people that are trapped in my work — — have become part of my work as well .
because one cup of food a day changes fabian 's life completely .
this is a picture of me and my three children .
one of my mentors in life was norman borlaug , my hero .
this is something that can be transformed with knowledge .
when disaster strikes -- the economy gets blown , people lose a job , floods , war , conflict , bad governance , all of those things -- there is nothing to fall back on .
cameroon , northern cameroon , boom and bust cycles of hunger every year for decades .
well this picture -- i was in hebron in a small shop , this shop , where instead of bringing in food , we provide digital food , a card .
and what i 've found is , rather than investing their money in food subsidies and other things , they invested in a school feeding program .
i believe we 're living at a time in human history where it 's just simply unacceptable that children wake up and don 't know where to find a cup of food .
we , the adults of the last four generations , have blessed our children with the destiny of a shorter lifespan than their own parents .
it costs way less than obesity now .
she 's got six years to live because of the food that she 's eaten .
he 's sick of it .
the labeling in this country is a disgrace .
normal . let 's get on schools , something that i 'm fairly much a specialist in .
you know , the amount of additives , e numbers , ingredients you wouldn 't believe -- there 's not enough veggies at all . french fries are considered a vegetable .
jo : what do you think this is ? i don 't know .
there 's our milk . there 's our carton .
love them . they just sell us what we want . all right .
that means that they can be students , young parents , and be able to sort of duck and dive around the basics of cooking , no matter what recession hits them next time . if you can cook , recession money doesn 't matter .
the kitchen is 25 grand a month . okay ?
thank you .
and you go , " oh , there 's a good boy . "
and because he 's performing a behavior you 've trained him to do ?
then we phase out the food as a lure , and now the dog knows that " sit " means sit , and you can actually communicate to a dog in a perfectly constructed english sentence .
and what we 're doing , in essence , is we 're teaching the dog , kind of like -- we 're letting the dog think that the dog is training us .
i bet a lot of you do , right ?
and a lot of my friends train really neat animals , grizzly bears -- if you 've ever seen a grizzly bear on the telly or in film , then it 's a friend of mine who 's trained it -- killer whales . i love it because it wires you up .
and the seminal moment was , i was getting on a plane in dallas , and in row two was a father , i presume , and a young boy about five , kicking the back of the chair .
and then , a little behavior problem comes up .
your kids are easy to train .
i 'm like , " okay , all right , this guy is slowing down , i 'll slow down too . "
what 's more important ?
that guy 's been on the road probably for the last half hour .
we 're now adding more and more robots into the mix , and we encountered some problems .
i believe our cars can talk about us behind our backs .
i 'm sorry .
it was deemed impossible .
of course , this was the holy grail of our industry , and the fact that this guy is a global icon didn 't help either , because i 'm sure if any of you ever stand in line at the grocery store , you know -- we see his face constantly .
we really felt like we were in a -- kind of a 12-step program .
the state of the art at the time was something called marker-based motion capture .
initially , we came across some remarkable research done by a gentleman named dr. paul ekman in the early ' 70s .
this is when we 're like , " ok , we 're going to be ok , this is actually going to work . "
we went through this process , then , called retargeting .
and so here , you can see again , the chosen take .
and if you could feel the warmth , and feel the humanity , and feel his intent coming through the eyes , then we would succeed .
it doesn 't recognize an ironic smile , or a happy smile , or a frustrated smile .
points out the window .
and to make it more interesting , we 'll start from the ending and we 'll go to the beginning .
a well told promise is like a pebble being pulled back in a slingshot and propels you forward through the story to the end .
editors and screenwriters have known this all along .
and some of us are born with temperaments that are positive , some are negative .
and it 's interesting to see how that led us places that were actually pretty good .
hey , off the bed !
and i saw that thing seven times in one month .
come on . get up .
i don 't know if my parents really believe that , but i didn 't want to prove them wrong .
and people do terrible things in wars .
and after just a few days , it becomes clear that whatever is causing this illness , marmite is the cure .
i see it in our business leaders .
brilliant work .
we tend to retreat and say , " we can draw a picture , we can post some graphs , we get it , we understand how this works . "
how do you do it ?
you try out all 10 . you keep the one that works best .
it 's come through trial and error .
until then , until then i 'm going to keep banging on about trial and error and why we should abandon the god complex .
shut it down at once . "
in fact , it turns out it 's equivalent to proving fermat 's last theorem .
and i would like to say that life was totally easy with them .
yeah .
now my publishing career began when i designed the cover for my eighth grade yearbook , and if you 're wondering about the style of dress i put our mascot in , i was really into bell biv devoe and mc hammer and vanilla ice at the time .

bad zoning , but ... "
and then she goes , " what if there was like a party , and there was just like a whole bunch of girls and a whole bunch of boys , and there was a bunch of men and women and they just started doing it , mom ?
and i looked into this trusting , loving face , and i said , " oh , no .
and they 're just so uncomfortable .
but bandura has a step-by-step process that was super successful .
and they come in and they go through the process , our process , they build confidence and now they think of themselves differently .
he painted the walls and he painted the machine , and he got the operators retrained by people who know kids , like children 's museum people .
and i thought a lot about , what was my daughter 's life going to be like without me ?
that they should achieve what bandura calls self-efficacy , that you can do what you set out to do , and that you can reach a place of creative confidence and touch the snake .
and they started listening to the marketplace , and they came back with ideas for cassava chips , and banana chips , and sorghum bread , and before you knew it , we had cornered the kigali market , and the women were earning three to four times the national average .
the first is that dignity is more important to the human spirit than wealth .
these are old-hand farmers who 've gone through all the agricultural ups and downs in kenya over the last 30 years .
i talked about it a little at oxford two years ago , and some of you visited a to z manufacturing , which is one of the great , real companies in east africa .
and so , anuj and acumen have been talking about testing the private sector , because the assumption that the aid establishment has made is that , look , in a country like tanzania , 80 percent of the population makes less than two dollars a day .
but because she had the opportunity of the marketplace , and she lived in a society that provided the safety of having access to affordable health and education , her children and their children were able to live lives of real purpose and follow real dreams .
to address this , i , along with four friends , founded ambulance access for all , to promote life-support ambulance services in india .
and the demand side being mostly politicians , bureaucrats and those who have discretionary power vested with them .
i don 't want to be haunted by such images any more .
shaffi mather : i just have to get through the initial days where i don 't get eliminated .
if you can pull this off , you will be a global hero .
and the tongkonan is symbolic not only of the family 's identity but also of the human life cycle from birth to death .
and this metaphor of membership in the greater human family is the way that children also describe the money that they invest in these sacrificial buffaloes that are thought to carry people 's soul from here to the afterlife , and children will explain that they will invest the money in this because they want to repay their parents the debt for all of the years their parents spent investing and caring for them .
in reality , the relationship between the living and the dead has its own drama in the u.s. healthcare system , where decisions about how long to stretch the thread of life are made based on our emotional and social ties with the people around us , not just on medicine 's ability to prolong life .
and we see that it cratered during the great recession , and it hasn 't started to bounce back at all .
that 's ken on the right getting beat three to one by watson , the " jeopardy ! " -playing supercomputer from ibm .
there are some optimistic answers to this question , so some people will bring up the age of exploration and the opening up of the world .
and over and over again , we see this happening in the technology-facilitated world .
it 's essentially a fundamental shift in our relationship with stuff , with the things in our lives .
it allows us to engage in really new and interesting ways .
they targeted to universities .
and so basically even if you think it 's 10 percent , 90 percent of the time , something that costs us a lot of money -- personally , and also we organize our cities around it and all sorts of things -- 90 percent of the time it 's sitting around .
we know also , because we 're connected in social networks , that it 's easy to create delight in one little place .
and so it 's reliable , real data that 's right in my face , where i am , so i can finish the latte .
it 's very cost-effective , and it 's very mesh-y .
what has changed our society has been wireless devices .
the rem sleep , rapid eye movement , dream state , is in light green ; and light is gray , light sleep ; and deep sleep , the best restorative sleep , is that dark green .

a lot of you have gotten that phillips direct life .
this is the headband that goes with this alarm clock .
this was really fascinating because this gave that quantitation about all the different phases of sleep .
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
and what it 's trying to do is accelerate this era : to take unmet medical needs , to work and innovate -- and we just appointed the chief engineer , mehran mehregany , it was announced on monday -- then to move up with development , clinical trial validation and then changing medical practice , the most challenging thing of all , requiring attention to reimbursement , healthcare policy , healthcare economics .
thank you so much . i 'm going to try to take you on a journey of the underwater acoustic world of whales and dolphins .
very few nonhuman mammals can imitate sounds .
as these two animals form a social bond , their distinctive whistles actually converge and become very similar .
i 'd also like to point out that sound doesn 't obey boundaries .
what happened was , during the cold war , the u.s. navy had a system that was secret at the time , that they used to track russian submarines .
i 'd like to briefly just show what the ocean does to these calls .
this is a figure from a textbook on underwater sound .
one strategy is if your call 's down here , and the noise is in this band , you could shift the frequency of your call out of the noise band and communicate better .
but there 's also another problem from ships that i 'm illustrating here , and that 's the problem of collision .
what maersk did is they worked ways to slow down .
but to make a long story short , i had entered that protest as the editor-in-chief of a well-established printed magazine where i 'd worked for 11 years , and thanks to this unsolicited effects of tear gas , i left it as a journalist that was now committed to new ways of sharing the raw experience of what it 's like to be there , actually .
but then something happened , something that wasn 't predicted , that no one could have anticipated .
and that , actually , allowed us to become invisible in the middle of the protests , but it allowed us to do something else : to show what it was like to be in the protests , to present to people at home a subjective perspective .
but that was also useful , because we were still at the web , so that helped to trigger an important debate in the country on the role of the media itself and the state of the freedom of the press in the country .
perspectives can be altered .
seti doesn 't presume the existence of extra terrestrial intelligence ; it merely notes the possibility , if not the probability in this vast universe , which seems fairly uniform .
and the nearest star is 4.2 light years away , which means its light takes 4.2 years to get here .
so , one needs a very deep appreciation of the diversity and incredible scale of life on this planet as the first step in preparing to make contact with life elsewhere in the cosmos .
all of the concerted seti efforts , over the last 40-some years , are equivalent to scooping a single glass of water from the oceans .
and it wouldn 't simply change everything , it would change everything all at once . "
so , i look forward to working with the ted community to hear about your ideas about how to fulfill this wish , and in collaborating with you , hasten the day that that visionary statement can become a reality .
within the tower , people have come up with all sorts of solutions in response to the various needs which arise from living in an unfinished tower .
behind every window and door frame , you 'll see a small child peering back at you , and while makoko seems to be packed with people , what 's more shocking is actually the amount of children pouring out of every building .
throughout the day , it 's quite common to come across a small party taking place in the streets , just like this engagement party .
through this architecture by subtraction , these yaodongs are built literally inside of the soil .
now , many of you are probably saying , " wait a sec , is this tough to do ? "
i 'm telling you , crossing these things with 170-pound sled , that sled may as well have weighed 1,700 pounds , because that 's what it felt like .
and i remember looking at the guys thinking , " what do i take from this journey ? " you know ? seriously .
strung in the wind i called you but you did not hear ... and you 're a plant that needs poor soil and i have treated you too well to give up flowers ... oh , i have been too rich for you ... farther than the sun from me farther than i 'd have you be and i go north , i get so cold my heart is lava under stone you are not worthy you are not worthy ... with your calculating eyes spinning figures you cannot see me you cannot see me ... and if i tell myself enough i 'll believe it you are not worthy the sea , it freezes over ... to trap the light and i 'm in love with being in love and you were never quite the one in gerda 's eyes fragments of what you 've become and all the moths that fly at night believe electric light is bright you are not worthy you are not worthy with your calculating eyes spinning figures you cannot see me , no and if i tell myself enough i 'll believe it you are not worthy farther than the sun from me farther than i 'd have you be and i go north , i get so cold my heart is lava under stone you are not worthy you are not worthy with your calculating eyes spinning figures you cannot see me , no ... and if i tell myself enough , i 'll believe it thank you very much .
as they created their interactive mother 's day cards , you could see that they were really becoming fluent with new technologies .
it seems that everybody is getting into the act .
this is an example from a new version of scratch that we 'll be releasing in the next few months , and we 're looking again to be able to push you in new directions .
when you learn to code , it opens up for you to learn many other things .
victor had , i 'm sure , been taught about variables in schools , but he really didn 't -- he wasn 't paying attention .
so this is an example that came from after i had sent the mother 's day cards to my mom , she decided that she wanted to learn scratch .
maybe you 've had grand plans before but stopped yourself , thinking , " that 's impossible , " or , " that costs too much , " or , " that won 't benefit me . "
now , if you don 't trust someone , you place restrictions on them , right ?
but there 's a problem with this rosy picture of kids being so much better than adults .
i had no idea there were so many believers at a ted conference .
my happiness was so great that i said i wanted to die .
here 's a key passage where he basically describes the staircase .
durkheim wrote about a set of intense collective emotions that accomplish this miracle of e pluribus unum , of making a group out of individuals .
he said , " if the one tribe included a great number of courageous , sympathetic and faithful members who are always ready to aid and defend each other , this tribe would succeed better and conquer the other . "
let me illustrate this for you .
and now let 's rerun the simulation putting one of these superorganisms into a population of free-riders , of defectors , of cheaters and look what happens .
do you think they 're there pursuing their self-interest ?
we 're bees . we busted out of the hive during the enlightenment .

and now i want to show what they actually look like in this movie here .
it takes this worm two days to age as much as the normal worm ages in one day .
it speeds up aging . it makes it go faster .
so maybe it 's working in people the same way .
under those conditions , the foxo protein in blue has gone into the nucleus -- that little compartment there in the middle of the cell -- and it 's sitting down on a gene binding to it .
but what we think is that , under conditions of stress , the levels of these hormones drop -- for example , having limited food supply .
we don 't know the details of how this works , but we do know then that foxo genes can impact the lifespan of people .
let me get this straight .
and when you look at these 70 year-old turtles , you can 't tell the difference , just by looking , between those turtles and 20 year-old turtles .
all these houses are built from between 70 and 80 percent recycled material , stuff that was headed to the mulcher , the landfill , the burn pile .
so i had one of those , so i made some low-tech gadgetry , there , where you just stomp on the shoe last and then the door flies open , you throw your laundry down .
and sure enough , we 've had no problems with bull elephants .
our housing has become a commodity , and i 'll talk a little bit about that .
however , if we took a small hammer , and we added cracks to all the other windows , then we have a pattern .
i feature organic process .
i got a job for you as a foreman on a framing crew . it 's time for you to go . "
it 's a chattel mortgage , just like furniture , just like a car .
all we have to do is look at what one company did with carbonated prune juice .
sometimes we even have these formalized cultural expectations .
we have confused maslow 's hierarchy of needs just a little bit .
it 's in clothing and food and our transportation needs , our energy -- we sprawl just a little bit .
so that 's for fun .
we 're going to have some tomorrow .
how do we create ?
all of imagination -- everything that we think , we feel , we sense -- comes through the human brain .
so the point here is that not all boys exist within these rigid boundaries of what we think of as boys and girls , and not all girls exist within those rigid boundaries of what we think of as girls .
when we look at the universities , 60 percent of baccalaureate degrees are going to women now , which is a significant shift .
another way that zero tolerance lives itself out is in the writing of boys .
the next reason that boys ' cultures are out of sync with school cultures : there are fewer male teachers .
when you 're three , you better be able to write your name legibly , or else we 'll consider it a developmental delay .
we need to change the mindset of acceptance in boys in elementary schools .
where we started : my colleagues -- mike petner , shawn vashaw , myself -- we started by trying to look at the teachers ' attitudes and find out how do they really feel about gaming , what do they say about it .
some people in the last decade or two have started creating artwork with technology .
now don 't be shy .
ever see that little swiss army knife they have to fight with ?
data : i find it incredibly educational .
it 's the medical data explosion that we 're having right now .
so we have to do something that 's a little bit more intelligent than doing this .
as long as kids are playing computer games , graphics is getting better and better and better .
she had a bleeding up in the brain , and that 's been fixed with a little stent , a metal clamp that 's tightening up the vessel .
you can really see the details of the data set .
and what we 've done is that we 've turned the bullet into a light source , so that bullet is actually shining , and it makes it really easy to find these fragments .
so when i virtually touch data , it will generate forces in the pen , so i get a feedback .
and we heard a little bit about functional mri .
well this is fantastic . we can do this in real time .
and i think this is a great application for the future of this technology , because there 's very little known about the animal anatomy .
i had this company that i 'd spent 15 years building . it 's called future ; it was a magazine publishing company .
and to cut a long story short , here 's where i came to .
or you can view it as an evolutionary psychology kind of thing : did our genes invent this as a kind of trick to get us to behave in certain ways ? the ant 's brain , parasitized , to make us behave in certain ways so that our genes would propagate ?
the time scale on which ted operates is just fantastic after coming out of a magazine business with monthly deadlines .
and i also reported that we 'd made this mind-blowing discovery -- this once-in-a-lifetime discovery of towering jets erupting from those fractures at the south pole , consisting of tiny water ice crystals accompanied by water vapor and simple organic compounds like carbon dioxide and methane .
what i 'm going to offer you is a recipe , a combination of the two forces that changed the world for good , which is the alliance of compassion and enlightened self-interest .
but what else did you do ?
the opportunity we 're going to look to is a genuine basis for optimism about the bottom billion , and that is the commodity booms .
and how about the long run ?
now , there 's one big change since the commodity booms of the 1970s , and that is the spread of democracy .
so , we know it works . what would the content be of these international standards ?
if you think about it , the cost of promulgating international rules is zilch -- nothing .
so we trained them to be able to do three separate words , to lay out them properly .
he says that the conscious mind is this tiny rider on this giant elephant , the unconscious .
i 'm a big list maker , so i came up with a list .
and i 've found that it influenced my life and work in a very intriguing way .
we brought this raw data in and we filtered it .
so we looked at a few more conflicts .
and we start running the numbers on this . can we simulate it ?
so this graph here , i 'm going to show you now .
and while remixing and sharing have come to define the web as we know it , all of us can now be part of that story through simple tools that allow us to make things online .
popcorn immediately goes out onto the web , talks to google , grabs the map , and puts it in the display .
can we all just close our eyes for a minute ?
anyway , bear with me .
it 's a bit of , well , we could call it night , we could call it the 96 percent of gravity that we don 't know about , dark matter , placed in space , anyway , another version of a human space in space at large , but i don 't know if you can see , the eyes are indicated , they 're closed .
there 's a hole at the anus , penis level .
thank you very much .
a boy broke away from his mother to run back into his house to get his dog , who was apparently afraid .
those were two accounts of the asian tsunami from two internet blogs that essentially sprang up after it occurred .
the first one is , what does it tell us about our ideas , about what motivates people to do things ?
the simplest example of this is if you ask a group of people to do something like guess how many jellybeans are in a jar .
but there 's also a downside to this -- a kind of dark side , in fact -- and that is that the more tightly linked we 've become to each other , the harder it is for each of us to remain independent .
and what happens is that the ants eventually end up in a circle .
can we all not systematically and consciously get infected ?
but we had parents who said , " okay , making our children good human beings is all very well , but what about math and science and english ?
atul karwal : aproch is an organization which has been doing things for kids earlier .
our parents are illiterate and we want to teach them how to read and write .
k so , the charter of compassion starts right here .
but that same year i was in london , 16 years ago , i realized something about myself that actually was somewhat unique , and that changed everything .
but i was paralyzed by my fear of not being accepted .
i don 't know , because i was never honest with them about who i am .
thank you .
clearly i have a german mother somewhere .
the day-to-day frustrations of dealing with this can be , let 's just say very annoying .
it acts as a backup to the internet so that , when the power goes out , it fails over and connects to the nearest gsm network .
i will close by saying that , if we solve this for the local market , it could be impactful not only for the coders in nairobi but also for small business owners who need reliable connectivity , and it can reduce the cost of connecting , and hopefully collaboration within african countries .
say this person approaching here , and they say , " well is this a suicide bomber or not ?
it 's sort of your classic idea of a heat ray .
and of course , being australian , i started looking at stuff in australia , knowing , again , from my own experience about various times when non-lethal weapons have been introduced in australia .
so it wasn 't that queensland had a particular problem with deaths from police shootings and so on .
so chechens had come in and taken control of the theater .
another problem that i just want to quickly mention is that there 's a whole heap of problems with the way that people actually get taught to use non-lethal weapons and get trained about them and then get tested and so on .
and they clearly learned a lot from it because in the same district , " police review policy after children shocked : 2nd child shocked by taser stun gun within weeks . "
so if you threaten to use it , people are going to comply with it , but it 's also going to be something that doesn 't leave any lasting effects . "
and some of you all might know , about five years ago i was an analyst at a hedge fund , and i was in boston , and i was tutoring my cousins in new orleans , remotely .
and then in a response to that same comment -- this is on the thread .
the other thing that happened -- and even at this point , i said , " okay , maybe it 's a good supplement .
and the khan academy videos are there .
we encourage you to experiment . we encourage you to failure .
and so what i 'm showing you here , this is actually data from a pilot in the los altos school district , where they took two fifth grade classes and two seventh grade classes and completely gutted their old math curriculum .
and the data gets pretty granular so you can see the exact problems that the student got right or wrong .
in our mind , the relevant metric is student-to-valuable-human-time- with-the-teacher ratio .
yeah , we 've put a bunch of game mechanics in there where you get these badges , we 're going to start having leader boards by area , and you get points .
so some of those views we saw were for the teacher to go in and track actually what 's going on with those kids .
i think you just got a glimpse of the future of education .
and what gave her inspiration and meaning was the fact that she was taking care of people who were far away from home .
so as i started reading more maslow , what i started to realize is that maslow , later in his life , wanted to take this hierarchy for the individual and apply it to the collective , to organizations and specifically to business .
so i went out and studied a bunch of things , and i found a survey that showed that 94 percent of business leaders worldwide believe that the intangibles are important in their business , things like intellectual property , their corporate culture , their brand loyalty , and yet , only five percent of those same leaders actually had a means of measuring the intangibles in their business .
so as i spent time with leaders in the gnh movement , i got to really understand what they 're doing .
how many of us here , as tedsters in the audience , spend more of our time in the bottom half of this equation , in the denominator ?
certainly robert kennedy suggested at the end of the speech exactly that .
gdp has been our hammer .
we count numbers .
but over the past 10 or 20 years , what 's happened is that services are being commoditized as well .
they say , you americans .
in fact , you can look at how each of these economies developed , that each one has their own business imperative , matched with a consumer sensibility .
there are two dimensions to authenticity : one , being true to yourself , which is very self-directed .
right ? you don 't tend to walk a lot in los angeles , well , here 's a place where you are going to walk a lot , outside in this city .
the abc network , affectionately known in the trade as the t & amp ; a network , right -- that 's not too much jargon , is it ?
you know how much coffee is worth , when treated as a commodity as a bean ?
but what is electrical resistance ?
well , first there are strands of magnetic field left inside , but now the superconductor doesn 't like them moving around , because their movements dissipate energy , which breaks the superconductivity state .
one hundred billion strands of magnetic field inside this three-inch disk .
the superconducting layer , instead of being half a micron thin , being two millimeters thin , quite thin .
there was , however , an incident i 'm going to tell you about , that perhaps could have led me suspect something .
these are real !
during that time the war was happening and his mother was killed when he was 15 .
but it was only the beginning .
then there were the emotional sacrifices : how can one live with a woman while having so many secrets ?
in africa there were countries fighting for their independence : guinea , guinea-bissau , angola .
he said no .
and at the time , people actually answered that question positively : " yes . "
but we learn a lot from that : not only that there is a planet there , but we also learn its size .
finally , 15 years ago , the technology came to the point where we could discover a planet around another star , and we actually did pretty well .
well , first of all , we can study them now that we know where they are .
and that 's a very basic question , which we don 't know the answer to , but which we can try -- and we are trying -- to answer in the lab .
this understanding of chemistry actually can help us with our daily lives .
would that make us more responsible for what is happening today ?
this tells us that that insignificance paradigm that we somehow got to learn from the copernican principle , it 's all wrong .
peter hirshberg : which is more fun , internet or tv ?
doesn 't work out too well for them , they lose money .
jay forrester : hello new york , this is cambridge .
we 're threatened by the greatest weapon ever , and knowing a good thing when it sees it , the air force decides it needs the biggest computer ever to protect us .
but like , let 's imagine we took the latest pentium processor , the latest core 2 extreme , which is a four-core processor that intel 's working on , it will be our laptop tomorrow .
it may yet be possible to eke out a poor existence for radio , but i don 't know how . "
and actually , ending the career of a lot of people at cbs .
you know , the expression of technology reflects the people and the time of the culture it was built in .
the title was taken from the lyrics to a jefferson airplane song . the lyrics go , " remember what the dormouse said .
now , as long as we confine this to the education market , and a personal matter between the computer and the file system , that 's fine , but as you can see , it was about to leap out and upset jack valenti and a lot of other people .
never had scientists been put under such pressure and demand .
and i think it 's the reason that tv 's so challenged .
here is a clip from a video , from a piece of animation that was written by a writer in hollywood , animation worked out in israel , farmed out to croatia and india , and it 's now an international series .
one of my heroes is songwriter , ally willis , who just wrote " the color purple " and has been an r and -- rhythm and blues writer , and this is what she said about where songwriting 's going .
the intensity of the upspring .
your father is murdered .
so since then i 've been the bridge , and a lot of people have walked over me .
if you could please stand up , [ unclear ] .
a lot of young girls look up to me .
and i just wanted to share with you : there 's one reporter that came .
i am an example , and there are others like me .
going down there was like entering a time capsule , and i came out with a different sense of myself in time .
stromatolites were the first to exhale oxygen .
life flourished in swamps .
a trick shared by the largest flower on earth .
and forests dried out once more . going upright became a lifestyle .
today i will tell human stories of bionic integration , how electromechanics attached to the body and implanted inside the body are beginning to bridge the gap between disability and ability , between human limitation and human potential .
at the mit media lab , we 've established the center for extreme bionics .
you see a bunch of points , or nodes .
how do my bionic limbs move like flesh and bone ?
it 's so profound in its augmentation that when a normal , healthy person wears the device for 40 minutes and then takes it off , their own biological legs feel ridiculously heavy and awkward .
it 's just like i 've got a real leg .
i 'd like to finish up with one more story , a beautiful story , the story of adrianne haslet-davis .
elliott and nathan .
okay , turn back , if you didn 't look .
this comes from a nazi children 's book published in 1938 : " just look at these guys ! the louse-infested beards , the filthy , protruding ears , those stained , fatty clothes ...
in a more recent follow-up study , we were able to look at a much greater sample , a much larger sample . in this case , this is nearly 30,000 u.s. respondents , and we find the same pattern . as you can see , people who are on the very conservative side of answering the political orientation scale are also much more likely to report that they 're easily disgusted .
in particular , when we asked them questions about sort of taboo but fairly harmless sexual practices , just being reminded that they ought to wash their hands made them think that they were more morally wrong .
stephen petranek : at first , it all seemed a little fantastical to me , but after challenging a lot of these ideas , i began to take a lot of them seriously . and then september 11 happened , and i thought , ah , god , i can 't go to the ted conference and talk about how the world is going to end .
a female child born tomorrow , on average -- median -- will live to age 83 .
so , i don 't know how much civilization really has progressed since ad 79 , but there 's a great likelihood . i really believe this , and i don 't believe in aliens , and i don 't believe there are any aliens on the earth or anything like that . but there 's a likelihood that we will confront a civilization that is more intelligent than our own .
we have lost 25 percent of the unique species in hawaii in the last 20 years .
number seven : particle accelerator mishap .
bt corn is a corn that creates its own pesticide to kill a corn borer .
so , maybe we 're in the throes of it .
i wrote a story about this in life magazine in 1993 .
it is nuts . we give antibiotics -- -- every cow , every lamb , every chicken , they get antibiotics every day , all .
about a billion miles away , here 's what happens to earth 's orbit : it becomes elliptical instead of circular .
there are about 100,000 balls of ice and rock -- comets , really -- out there , that are 50 miles in diameter or more , and they regularly take a little spin , in towards the sun and pass reasonably close to us .
you 'll notice that a lot of comets are named after people you never heard of , amateur astronomers ? that 's because nobody 's looking for them , except amateurs .
that 's a mistake that could literally cost us our future .
every 30 seconds a patient dies from diseases that could be treated with tissue regeneration or replacement .
your bones regenerate every 10 years .
so , we can use these smart biomaterials but only for about one centimeter to bridge those gaps .
here we take a scaffold , and we basically -- scaffold can be like a piece of paper here .
same strategy , we take a very small piece of the bladder , less than half the size of a postage stamp .
we take the scaffold , we seed it with cells , and you can now see here , the valve leaflets opening and closing .
this technology was developed by tao ju , who worked at our institute .
so , another strategy we 're following is actually to create wafers that we stack together , like an accordion , if you will .
if we cannot use stem cells from your body then we 'd like to use donor stem cells .
i 'm going to show you now , a very short clip , it 's a five second clip of a patient who received one of the engineered organs .
specifically , we wanted to know how serotonin would affect the way people react when they 're treated unfairly .
i think these folks meant well , but had i taken them up on their offers , i would have been going beyond the science , and good scientists are careful not to do this .
so what i 'm going to do is show you how to spot a couple of classic moves , dead giveaways , really , for what 's variously been called neuro-bunk , neuro-bollocks , or , my personal favorite , neuro-flapdoodle .
so he 's calling oxytocin " the moral molecule . "
we haven 't found a " buy " button inside the brain , we can 't tell whether someone is lying or in love just by looking at their brain scans , and we can 't turn sinners into saints with hormones .
we explore for three reasons , the weakest of which is curiosity .
and that , my friend , is amazing motivation .
but how cheap could it get ? i want to give you the end point .
they come with their own money . they 're easy to make .
we 've had a lot of accomplishments and it 's been a tremendous success .
i had the pleasure of borrowing from the longitude prize and the orteig prize that put lindbergh forward .
then , you 've got to , you know , face potential public ridicule of -- that 's a crazy idea , it 'll never work .
let 's see if we can get into the flow here and all do this one together .
hey , hey , black-eyed susie ! hey , hey , black-eyed susie !
so i went back that very summer .
well , have you heard the many stories told by young and old with joy about the many deeds of daring that were done by the johnson boys ?
she pulled the car over ; she said , " get out of the car . "
don 't want it to leave me behind . "
but that day in the cotton field out there picking , when those people started singing , i realized i was in the very heart of real music , and that 's where i 've wanted to be ever since .
after the -- she was glad to have a story about herself , of course , but after the concert she came up and she said , " david , i 've got to tell you something .
i had to sit down and make lists , because i was ready to go ; i was ready to check out of this world .
but i got some medicine here that just might shake things loose .
so we went over into michael 's garage -- his dad had all kinds of stuff , and we put a pipe in the vice there , and screwed a cap on the end of the pipe , drilled a hole in the back of the pipe , took some of our firecrackers , pulled out the fuses , tied them together , put them in the back there , and -- down in that hole -- and then stuffed some of our gunpowder down that pipe and put three ball bearings on the top , in the garage .
no hair , no eyelashes , no nothing .
i had been blogging under the name patient dave , and when i discovered this , i just renamed myself e-patient dave .
it was a hippie journal of self-sufficiency .
and if you look in that red oval , that shadow was not supposed to be there .
one was growing out the front and it had already erupted , and it latched onto the bowel .
i mean , i 'd been getting tired in the evening , but i was 56 years old .
very quickly they told me , " kidney cancer is an uncommon disease .
don 't worry about the numbers .
and i actually said at one conference a couple of years ago , " give me my damn data , because you people can 't be trusted to keep it clean . "
one final story : this is kelly young , a rheumatoid arthritis patient from florida .
and he got them chanting by the end of the talk , " raw data now .
the war is so worrying at present , with court cases coming up in one state after another , that i felt i had to say something about it .
now , it may sound as though i 'm about to preach atheism , and i want to reassure you that that 's not what i 'm going to do .
my approach to attacking creationism is to attack religion as a whole , and at this point i need to acknowledge the remarkable taboo against speaking ill of religion , and i 'm going to do so in the words of the late douglas adams , a dear friend who , if he never came to ted , certainly should have been invited .
" professor hordley was brought up to have total and unquestioning faith " -- -- " ... that an asteroid killed the dinosaurs . "
and that all stems from the perception of atheists as some kind of weird , way-out minority .
but let me know show you some data that have been properly published and analyzed on one special group , namely , top scientists .
when a critical mass has been attained , there 's an abrupt acceleration in recruitment .
so , my friend is strictly agnostic about the tooth fairy , but it isn 't very likely , is it ? like god .
" non-theist " will do for all that , yet unlike " atheist , " it doesn 't have the same phobic , hysterical responses .

and it 's a responsive system that 's trained on actual weather .
and in the end , you know , they adapted this as a national icon that came to represent swiss doubt , which we -- you know , it was kind of a meaning machine that everybody kind of laid on their own meanings off of .
we used the wall to partition the 13 installations of the project and produce a kind of acoustic and visual separation .
it was really great when it started to break up all of the curatorial text .
and this was really a kind of very important part of this building , and here is a point where architecture -- this is like technology-free -- architecture is only a framing device , it only edits the harbor view , the industrial harbor just through its walls , its floors and its ceiling , to only expose the water itself , the texture of water , much like a hypnotic effect created by electronic snow or a lava lamp or something like that .
now , that 's really tough to do with a hall that has 1,100 seats .
so what we wanted to do was produce this effect , this lighting effect , which made us have to bioengineer the wood walls .
now , this type of surgery is hard , and it starts by putting people to sleep , putting carbon dioxide in their abdomen , blowing them up like a balloon , sticking one of these sharp pointy things into their abdomen -- it 's dangerous stuff -- and taking instruments and watching it on a tv screen .
and eventually , if you 're lucky , you achieve mastery .
but for this examination , which is really hard , we have a problem .
so i 'm passionate about teaching these fls skills all over the world .
and now we 've got the words , and we can apply the special sauce : the translation .
orient your loop this way .
and this is when it really gets interesting .
and that 's all very true .
it was such a beautiful machine because it did everything that a human being did in setting type -- including returning the type to its place , which was a very difficult thing .
and not only did they do it , but within two years , they scaled up penicillin from preparation in one-liter flasks to 10,000-gallon vats .
they have combined the list of major innovations , and they 've discovered that the greatest number , the greatest decade , for fundamental innovations , as reflected in all of the lists that others have made -- a number of lists that they have merged -- was the great depression .
we need to learn from those figures that i mentioned .
i was nominated for a grammy and i 've won some awards and stuff like that , so that 's awesome , but the best part was meeting my husband , and i 've actually known donnell for probably 12 years now , and i 'm going to get into a little bit of , i guess , how music brought us together , but i 'm going to introduce you right now to my new husband as of october 5 , donnell leahy .
twelve years , er , 20 years later little did she think her kids would be getting married , but anyway , so , then i got a phone call about , i dunno , seven years later . i was 19 , first or second year of college , and it was donnell , and he said " hi , you probably don 't know me but my name is donnell leahy . "
dl : you start . nm : no , you have to start , because you 've got to do your thing .
dl : what about leahy ?
that 's what i have behind myself .
it ain 't pretty .
let me show you what it looks like .
the reason why that 's reasonable is , when your grandparents were given social security , they got it at 65 and were expected to check out at 68 .
and what 's really important in this stuff is , as we cut , we also have to grow .
then they stop growing .
you can freeze half the brain . it regrows .
then , they sprayed stem cells onto that heart , from a mouse .
these are not the only interesting robots .
and then they 'll be able to see shape .
so , if that 's not the purpose of the universe , then what 's next ?
and he lives in the sand , and he catches things that go by overhead .
so we got this incredible video system . it 's very new technology -- it just came out about a year ago -- that allows you to film at extremely high speeds in low light .
so the muscle contracts , and nothing happens .
so , we 've had very solid evidence showing that that saddle-shaped structure actually compresses and extends , and does , in fact , function as a spring .
and so this is just a regular video of the animal just smashing the heck out of this load cell .
there 's that raptorial appendage -- there 's the heel , and it 's going to swing around and hit the load cell .
so , one question i often get after this talk -- so i figured i 'd answer it now -- is , well , what happens to the animal ?
and also the miller institute for basic research in science , which gave me three years of funding to just do science all the time , and for that i 'm very grateful . thank you very much .
and it 's africa that stands out as the problem down here , doesn 't it ?
and they lost one-fifth of their kids before their first birthday .
and down in 1915 , the united states was a neighbor of india -- present , contemporary india .
and i 'm going to stage a race here between this sort of yellowish ford here and the red toyota down there , and the brownish volvo .
that 's when i believe statistics , when it 's grandma-verified statistics .
well , you see the nice story of getting richer and getting healthier -- everyone did it at the cost of emission of carbon dioxide .
and we drive away here -- we find the first garden in the street , and they earn 10 to 50 dollars a day .
when you 're in poverty , everything is about survival .
africa has not done bad .
if you are fighting in a non-governmental organization , you love equity between gender .
health i give two points . i mean it 's nice to be healthy -- at my age especially -- you can stand here , you 're healthy .
and i 'm going to take this blade of steel , and push it down through my body of blood and flesh , and prove to you that the seemingly impossible is possible .
don 't give up on the poor kids , because you never know what 's going to happen to those children in life . "
well , i think that welfare mothers and at-risk kids and ex-steel workers deserve a fountain in their life .
the cost is incidental but the gesture is huge .
that happens to be our cafeteria line .
there is absolutely no reason why poor people can 't learn world class technology .
and why we can 't institute that policy in every school and in every city and every town remains a mystery to me .
and he got 10 parents and then 20 parents .
well , i 'm very pleased to announce to you that hp and a furniture company called steelcase have adopted us as a demonstration model for all of their technology and all their furniture for the united states of america .
and that worked out all right .
and i think we 're going to be fine .
and this is what i want to do when i grow up .
and now i really want to build one . "
and jeff and i did become friends , and he 's organized a team of people and we 're going to build this center .
and if that 's not true , how did i get here ? "
i want you to take a look at this baby .
the baby sits on a parent 's lap , and we train them to turn their heads when a sound changes -- like from " ah " to " ee . "
japanese mother : [ japanese ] patricia kuhl : during the production of speech , when babies listen , what they 're doing is taking statistics on the language that they hear .
it was like having mandarin relatives come and visit for a month and move into your house and talk to the babies for 12 sessions .
we 're looking at millimeter accuracy with regard to spatial and millisecond accuracy using 306 squids -- these are superconducting quantum interference devices -- to pick up the magnetic fields that change as we do our thinking .
julian assange : yeah , can it possibly be true ?
he was a soft dictator of kenya .
light ' em all up .
j i don 't know . i guess people can see the gross disparity in force .
and that 's what we 've found in practice , and that 's what the history of journalism is .
j not really . i mean , we don 't have any wikileaks dissidents yet .
we couldn 't verify it because we didn 't know who wrote it and knew what it was about .
j yep . yeah , and trusted people .
and that 's something from my father and something from other capable , generous men that have been in my life .
when you think of the future then , do you think it 's more likely to be big brother exerting more control , more secrecy , or us watching big brother , or it 's just all to be played for either way ?
and i 've been thinking about how that applies across a whole spectrum of realms , from , say , the ecological , okay .
it doesn 't have a name yet .
xu liu : test mice .
xl : so we clipped part of this sensor , and attached that to a switch to control the cells , and we packed this switch into an engineered virus and injected that into the brain of the mice .
now to do that , first we need to trick brain cells to respond to laser beams .
xl : however , if you put the mouse in a completely different new box , like the next one , it will not be afraid of this box because there 's no reason that it will be afraid of this new environment .
we 're really excited about this .
now the next day , we can take our animals and place them in a red box that they 've never experienced before .
sr : and finally , what do we make of all this ?
so if we start to think exponentially , we can see how this is starting to affect all the technologies around us .
so let 's see now how exponential technologies are taking health care .
compare those two pictures , and now as a radiologist , you can essentially fly through your patient 's colon and , augmenting that with artificial intelligence , identify potentially , as you see here , a lesion .
we 're now in the era of virtual visits -- from sort of the skype-type visits you can do with american well , to cisco that 's developed a very complex health presence system .
and as we start to integrate this information , we 're going to know better what to do with it and how better to have insight into our own pathologies , health and wellness .
now how about controlling other elements ?
sometimes these might self-assemble in your gi system and be augmented in that reality .
in genomics now , the genome cost about a billion dollars about 10 years ago when the first one came out .
and by looking at the patterns , for example , in our blood of 10,000 biomarkers in a single test , we can start to look at these little patterns and detect disease at a much earlier stage .
now i 'll close with regenerative medicine .
because i know as a doctor , if someone comes to me with stage i disease , i 'm thrilled -- we can often cure them .
how can the brain generate that much information , that much music , spontaneously ?
if you 've been in an mri scanner , it 's very much the same , but this one is outfitted in a special way to not just take pictures of your brain , but to also take pictures of active areas of the brain .
we actually have to come up with a scientific experiment .
now these are multifunctional areas of the brain .
he 's in there . you can see his legs up there .
and so i 've always been fascinated by free-style .
it 's doing something that , neurologically , is remarkable .
when we walked through the savanna a thousand years ago we made linear predictions where that animal would be , and that worked fine . it 's hardwired in our brains .
here we have 49 famous computers . i put them in a logarithmic graph .
and i 'd say this knowledge is over-fitting to past data .
and we will have plenty of computation as we go through the 21st century to do things like simulate regions of the human brain .
based on that we are announcing , here at ted , in true ted tradition , singularity university .
with all the legitimate concerns about aids and avian flu -- and we 'll hear about that from the brilliant dr. brilliant later today -- i want to talk about the other pandemic , which is cardiovascular disease , diabetes , hypertension -- all of which are completely preventable for at least 95 percent of people just by changing diet and lifestyle .
when we get together with friends and family and we discuss crime in our country , crime in belmont or crime in diego or crime in marabella , nobody 's speaking about corruption .
we 're speaking about the fact that across the terrace , the next tower is the ministry of finance , and there 's a lot of connection with us today , so we 're speaking within your temple today . okay ?
we call it the section 34 fiasco , the section 34 fiasco , a suspicious piece of law , and i 'm going to say it like it is , a suspicious piece of law was passed at a suspicious time to free some suspects .
i 'm being a bit mysterious for those of you out there . what were they accused of ?
what if this is just the first time that the so-and-sos had been caught ?
they 've had bailouts in europe .
that is the law since 1999 .
and the most famous case was what we came to call the secret scholarship scandal , where in fact there was about 60 million dollars in government money that had been dispersed in a series of scholarships , and the scholarships hadn 't been advertised , and so and so on and so on .
we will continue to press on .
i 'm a creative technologist and the focus of my work is on public installations .
devices like the cymascope , which you can see here , have been used to scientifically observe cymatic patterns .
then sort of take a leap and think about the universe forming .
so in march , 2012 , just one month ago , some researchers reported in the journal nature how they had tried to replicate 53 different basic science studies looking at potential treatment targets in cancer , and out of those 53 studies , they were only able to successfully replicate six .
but this problem of negative results that go missing in action is still very prevalent . in fact it 's so prevalent that it cuts to the core of evidence-based medicine .
about half of all trials , on average , go missing in action , and we know that positive findings are around twice as likely to be published as negative findings .
first of all , we had trials registers , and everybody said , oh , it 's okay . we 'll get everyone to register their trials , they 'll post the protocol , they 'll say what they 're going to do before they do it , and then afterwards we 'll be able to check and see if all the trials which have been conducted and completed have been published .
i 'd never seen anything like that .
we got madd chadd , lil ' c , kid david and j smooth .
and you just got this piece of energy and you just , you 're manipulating it .
we induce cells , okay , say , skin cells , by adding a few genes to them , culturing them , and then harvesting them .
well , this is another trend in the field .
the sense in which i can be uplifting and inspiring -- i mean , there 's always been a kind of a certain grim dimension to the way i try to uplift , so if grim inspiration -- -- if grim inspiration is not a contradiction in terms , that is , i 'm afraid , the most you can hope for . ok , today -- that 's if i succeed .
originally , you had the most complex societies , the hunter-gatherer village .
now , this sounds like an intrinsically upbeat worldview in a way , because when you think of non-zero , you think win-win , you know , that 's good . well , there are a few reasons that actually it 's not intrinsically upbeat .
it 's the downside correlation of their fortunes that will become more and more possible .
there 's going to have to be a lessening of the amount of hatred in the world , given how dangerous it 's becoming .
and i think that is an expansion of your moral compass when you manage to do that .
thanks .
and they are around three billion such letters long .
[ they 've ] sequenced approximately equally [ as ] many people in europe and in china .
but if we look on other parts of our bodies where we don 't directly interact with the environment -- our kidneys , our livers , our hearts -- there is no way to say , by just looking at these organs , where in the world they would come from .
then , significantly more often , does a neanderthal match the european rather than the african .
we don 't know quite where the borders between these people were , but we know that in southern siberia , there were both neanderthals and denisovans at least at some time in the past .
the material was generated in two years of work i did for the secretary of defense , thinking about a new national grand strategy for the united states .
i don 't know , taiwan straits 2025 .
so there 's no trouble accessing battle spaces .
and the chinese said to me , " dr. barnett , you 're absolutely right .
what i think this really represents is lack of an a to z rule set for the world as a whole for processing politically bankrupt states .
everybody 's got to answer their grandchildren some day what you did about the holocaust in africa , and you better have an answer .
we should have had 250,000 troops streaming into iraq on the heels of that leviathan sweeping towards baghdad .
you 've got to track coalition partners . create a record of success .
the rest of the military got dragged down into the muck across the 1990s and they developed this very derisive term to describe it : military operations other than war .
i 've got one , he 's everywhere , go find him . "
in 1947 we merged these two things together in the defense department .
it 's not like we had to find him actually killing somebody live to arrest him .
the rule is going to be this .
the force on the left , up or out .
i have been to the mountain top . i can see the future .
carriers go both ways because they 're a swing asset .
because when the thing gets prevented in chicago with the three million dead that perverts our political system beyond all recognition , these are the guys who are going to kill them first .
so i have a really cool day job-- i get to do some really amazing stuff .
and so i think that that holds together a great deal of the work that people in this audience approach .
so , my first bold prediction is that , is that in the universe , life is going to be everywhere .
how do you plan to look for it ?
and this has been invaluable in our approach to try to study these things .
and this is produced by bacteria who are actually making more sulfuric acid , and living at phs right around zero .
and you can see in these central images here , scanning electron micrographs of some of these guys -- these are gardens of these bacteria .
and in this case , we 're imagining intermediary robotic devices that can actually do some of that front-end work for us , to protect any potential life that we find .
the question as to whether there is life on mars that is related to life on earth has now been very muddied , because we now know , from mars meteorites that have made it to earth , that there 's material that can be exchanged between those two planets .
then market stocks seize and we 're like , " wow .
so where does it take us ?
one third of americans .
i predict scientifically 74 percent of you will go for bananas .
austria , a neighboring country , slightly similar , slightly different .
are we going to make them automatically join the plan , or are they going to be left out ?
we talked about inertia and organ donations and checking the box .
so that is the program , embarrassingly simple , but as we 're going to see , extremely powerful .
this is really the tip of the iceberg .
that 's why i 'm talking to you today about the age of design , and the age of design is the age in which design is still cute furniture , is still posters , is still fast cars , what you see at moma today .
did i ever say they were art ? i was talking about interaction design . excuse me .
and you know what ?
that 's what makes this acquisition more than a little game or a little joke . it 's truly a way to think of how to preserve and show artifacts that will more and more become part of our lives in the future .
eve online is an artificial universe , if you wish , but one of the diplomats that was killed in benghazi , not ambassador stevens , but one of his collaborators , was a really big shot in eve online , so here you have a diplomat in the real world that spends his time in eve online to kind of test , maybe , all of his ideas about diplomacy and about universe-building , and to the point that the first announcement of the bombing was actually given on eve online , and after his death , several parts of the universe were named after him .
but we don 't have gta because , maybe it 's my own reflection , i 've never been able to do anything but crashing cars and shooting prostitutes and pimps .
so the kind of interferences that you see here that look like beautiful barriers in the game are actually a consequence of the processor 's limitedness , which is fantastic . so aesthetics is always important .
by getting rid of the sticky carpets and the cigarette butts and everything else that we might remember from our childhood , i want people to understand that those are important forms of design .
alex steffen and i founded worldchanging in late 2003 , and since then we and our growing global team of contributors have documented the ever-expanding variety of solutions that are out there , right now and on the near horizon .
we know that people often change their behavior when they can see and understand the impact of their actions .
in kenya , mobile phone minutes have actually become an alternative currency .
in the best worldchanging tradition , it might also serve as a showcase for good ideas , successful projects and efforts to make a difference that deserve much more visibility .
now , all of this data could be tagged with geographic information and mashed up with online maps for easy viewing and analysis .
we just need to open our eyes . thank you very much .
and what 's really happened over the period of time that i 've been working in intensive care is that the people whose lives we started saving back in the ' 70s , ' 80s , and ' 90s , are now coming to die in the 21st century of diseases that we no longer have the answers to in quite the way we did then .
there wasn 't this dialogue going on that i imagined was happening .
the ones you may know most about are the ones that are becoming increasingly of historical interest : sudden death .
she 's the one he 's looking at , and [ she 's ] the one he 's coming for . can you see that ?
there are a couple of things you can do .
i think most people don 't want to be dead , but i do think most people want to have some control over how their dying process proceeds .
and it really helps me to understand how we see , how we hear , how we breathe , how our brain can inform or mislead us .
it is the perfect sound for our ears and our brain .
and db will probably roll toward you .
and this kind of relationship between designer and scientist started when i was at school .
and you have to peel and eat one layer a day .
and i remember an exhibition design i made for john maeda , and for the fondation cartier in paris .
so it 's , for me , a great product .
this one is kind of the same approach because i include , in a product like andrea , some plants .
now we can eat local food .
all of us need to be considered according to our real nature .
look at the client base for this .
wind is wonderful ; i love wind .
this is one from toshiba .
co2e emissions are equivalent emissions of all the greenhouse gases and particles that cause warming and converted to co2 .
well , right now in the united states , 50 to 100,000 people die per year from air pollution , and vehicles are about 25,000 of those .
as you can see from these pictures , the spacing between can be used for multiple purposes including agricultural land , range land or open space .
here are the world wind resources .
so that leaves a couple of places like iran , maybe venezuela , that you would like to have very close surveillance of anything that goes on with fissile stuff .
so if we get that through , then mark will solve these problems . thanks chris .
the capability of the sun shining , the wind blowing and the rain falling , simply isn 't enough to add up .
sb : i loved your " it all balances out " chart that you had there .
okay . so , thank you , mark .
although i was a satellite engineer , i hadn 't thought about using satellite imagery in my work .
now as aerospace engineering grad students , this chart cried out to us as a challenge .
we would have to build something larger than the original breadbox , now more like a mini-fridge , but we still wouldn 't have to build a pickup truck .
brain magic . what 's brain magic all about ?
now , i was fascinated , but at the same time , skeptical .
go ahead and take it off , you 're ok . we 'll just stop for a second .
i 'm not taking my eyes off the road .
so , do you believe it 's possible to see through somebody else 's eyes ?
now , it 's very important for everybody here to realize i haven 't set anything up with you guys .
nicole : no .
kb : what did you feel ?
and i want you to hold it there , just for a moment , and i only want you to allow your hand to sink and drift and float back to the tabletop at the same rate and speed as you drift and float into this relaxed state of awareness , and allow it to go all the way down to the tabletop .
only when you want the pressure to be released , make an upward gesture , like this , but only when you want the pressure to be released .
do you remember when they threw the coke bottle out of the airplane , and it landed on the ground , and it didn 't break ?
now , i 've got a shard of glass here , ok .
think about how many letters in the title .
kb : ok , steve , i want you to take a seat , right behind here . excellent .
i 'm going to have the last laugh , though .
no messing around this time .
sj : there 's a cup that way , yes .
sj : oh !
because now that media is increasingly social , innovation can happen anywhere that people can take for granted the idea that we 're all in this together .
this thing that looks like a peacock hit a windscreen is bill cheswick 's map of the internet .
they were taking videos of buildings shaking .
people began to figure out , in the sichuan provence , that the reason so many school buildings had collapsed -- because tragically the earthquake happened during a school day -- the reason so many school buildings collapsed is that corrupt officials had taken bribes to allow those building to be built to less than code .
on the 20th anniversary of tiananmen they just , two days ago , announced that they were simply shutting down access to twitter , because there was no way to filter it other than that .
it is the green lines now , that are the source of the free content , which brings me to my last story .
people in that group realized that obama had never shut them down .
they come up with these very restrictive labels to define us .
when they 're monitoring your clickstream -- and you know they are -- they have a really hard time figuring out your age , your gender and your income .
well , i actually don 't think that 's going to be the case .
and i told her , " i 'm going to scotland the next day . "
that was the first day i set my foot in a five-star hotel .
but then sometimes i 'm thinking , what are today 's young generation up to ?
about 80 percent of those microbloggers are young people , under 30 years old .
among the 200 million migrant workers , 60 percent of them are young people .
for the past decade or so , a massive urbanization and development have let us witness a lot of reports on the forced demolition of private property .
so in the next picture , you see a very popular phenomenon called " naked " wedding , or " naked " marriage .
and that situation cannot be right . we must do something about it .
if you cannot secure the parents , you cannot guarantee the security of the african child .
these worsening indices of health care or health studies in africa demand a new look . we cannot keep on doing things the way we 've always done them .
whether you have one dollar , two dollars -- it doesn 't matter .
and we will do other centers .
prevention must be part of the solution -- we emphasize that .
and , if they went to miami , they will spend significantly more -- eight to 10 times more . and they feel happy spending it at home , getting the same quality of care .
next stop is west african heart institute , that we are going to be doing in port harcourt , nigeria , as i said before . we will do other centers across west africa .
and then tacked on at the end of it are about 15 years for retirement .
there is wonderful inspiration coming from the area itself .
then this is a fairly talkative , verbose kind of chair .
that 's about five percent of everybody .
and probably most importantly , basically everything we 've done in the seven years following the first sabbatical came out of thinking of that one single year .
there is a full-blown orchestra living inside the building .
this is after a week .
and here we asked some nearby pigs to do the titles for us .
these people are tall .
and whenever he came home , it was a different case .
i talked to my father . i did something that most girls have never done .
it 's something that so many girls -- i 'm lucky , i never died -- but many die .
but the problem is , my father is not the only father i have .
i found snow !
she 's beaten .
she was not the top student when we took her .
move out , because as you change your world , as you change your community , as we believe that we are impacting one girl , one family , one village , one country at a time .
jitish kallat successfully practices across photography , sculpture , painting and installation .
this next artist is probably the alpha male of contemporary indian art , subodh gupta .
we were running windows 2000 .
the same can be said for our social systems , for our systems of government , where , at the very least , flow offers us a helpful metaphor for understanding what the problem is , what 's really broken , and the urgent need that we have , that we all feel today , to redesign the flow of our institutions .
now , we don 't fully have a picture of what this will look like yet , but we 're seeing pockets of evolution emerging all around us -- maybe not even evolution , i 'd even start to call it a revolution -- in the way that we govern .
sberbank , the largest and oldest bank in russia , largely owned by the russian government , has started practicing crowdsourcing , engaging its employees and citizens in the public in developing innovations .
the first phase is in getting better information in .
and i wanted to do something to help , but i always wondered , what could one person possibly do to make a difference ?
so two days later , i was on a plane headed for cape town with a team of penguin specialists .
but what gave us hope were these incredibly dedicated and brave volunteers -- three of whom here are force-feeding penguins .
the first penguins to make that transition to free feeding were the ones that had a metal band on their wing from the apollo sea spill six years earlier .
so , armed with this knowledge , sanccob has a chick-bolstering project .
and the problem i 'm going to talk about is not the familiar one from philosophy , which is , " how can we know whether other people have minds ? "
some observations on the slow development of this system as we learn how to do this difficult job .
rs : yeah . so ivan has this cheese sandwich , and he says , " yum yum yum yum yum !
rs : yeah , you think he 's going to take that one ? all right . let 's see .
yeah .
so , the first thing that we did is we gave adults a version of the pirate problem that we gave to the kids .
some people think she should deserve more blame , and other people less .
and the first thing is , people can still do this task overall .
so , there 's a couple of things to say about tms .
i mean , what chances do you think there are that at some time in your career , someone , you or someone else , is going to come up with some paradigm shift in understanding what seems an impossible problem ?
this little syringe contains the moral molecule .
i think i can do that .
and in that pair , one person gets a message saying , " do you want to give up some of your $ 10 you earned for being here and ship it to someone else in the lab ? "
so we have a biology of trustworthiness .
what does it feel like when your brain is flooded with oxytocin ?
so to investigate immorality , let me bring you back now to 1980 .
i have this job interview in galena in 15 minutes , and i need this job , i 've got to go . "
so we 've studied sexually abused women , and about half those don 't release oxytocin on stimulus .
and i drove up in my rented vauxhall .
so we investigated the role of social media and found the using social media produced a solid double-digit increase in oxytocin .
come here . give me a hug .
the picture that we best can determine was probably the one that they were shown in the photo array is in your bottom left hand corner of these mug shots .
it 's called reconstructed memories .
when you present those to people who are not well-versed in those aspects of science and that , they become salamanders in the noonday sun . it 's like talking about the tangent of the visual angle , all right ?
this judge is someone you 'd never want to play poker with .
and what does this example -- what 's important to keep in mind for ourselves ?
but it was also the signal that capped the use , or overuse , of energy-consuming devices .
what it is , it 's a lamination of two different metals together .
on the left , it 's when it 's cold and the thermo-bimetal is flat so it will constrict air from passing through the blocks , and on the right , the thermo-bimetal curls and allows that air to pass through , so those are two different components that i 'm working on , and again , it 's a completely different thing , because you can imagine that air could potentially be coming through the walls instead of opening windows .
anyway , you get the idea .
now let me put my money where my mouth is and show you that we can actually produce normal output , and what the implications of this are .
but there was this limiting factor , the issue of the code , and how to make the cells respond better , produce normal responses , and so this was our contribution .
so , i started collecting found objects .
so the small ones are short , and the bigger ones are longer .
" i feel pretty . "
so every five minutes , i took a photograph .
so these are all 3,214 pictures taken up there .
so , here you see the cast . these are all of the people in " the whale hunt " and the two whales that were killed down here .
so , you have some really happy person holding 10 balloons , and some really sad soul holding one balloon .
a 16-year-old quarry worker .
so his wish was to come with me , so that he had somewhere to live .
but here she had been living in a nunnery for the last seven years .
so , the last thing we did , very quickly , is i took all those wish balloons -- there were 117 interviews , 117 wishes -- and i brought them up to a place called dochula , which is a mountain pass in bhutan , at 10,300 feet , one of the more sacred places in bhutan .
and this is a sheet of acrylic infused with colorless light-diffusing particles .
the objects we use , the clothes we wear , the houses we live in , all have a profound impact on our behavior , health and quality of life .
but paper electronics is one of the most promising branches of material science in that it allows us to create cheaper and flexible electronics .
it literally says , " wat ar ou rea in ? " right ?
the question " why ? " is one of the most dangerous things you can do , because it takes you into uncertainty .
now , i should say that we didn 't get funding for this study because the scientists said small children couldn 't make a useful contribution to science , and the teachers said kids couldn 't do it .
now there 's a number of different rules the bees can learn to solve this puzzle . the interesting question is , which ?
methods , what did you do ? results , what was the observation ?
typical science , actually , right ? so this makes amy and her friends the youngest published scientists in the world .
this is the epitome of technology . right . okay .
ten years ago exactly , i was in afghanistan .
that was one of the worst nightmares that we have seen .
and this is how the revolution was born in tunisia .
and this is the moment that is happening right now in the arab world .
for 18 days , our cameras were broadcasting , live , the voices of the people in tahrir square .
thank you very much .
wk : i think we have discovered a very important issue in the arab world -- that people care , people care about this great transformation .
very few things went to the market .
it became a book . it became a show .
when we received the land , it was less than half a percent rainforest , as in all my region .
i wished to photograph the other animals , to photograph the landscapes , to photograph us , but us from the beginning , the time we lived in equilibrium with nature .
and we must rebuild these forests .
but you see a lot of small spots in this picture .
my work with criminals and terrorists has actually been highly educational .
guns and bombs are nothing new .
is he bald in front ? does he wear glasses ? "
there 's also been a big paradigm shift in crime .
by the way , these travel at over 600 miles an hour .
there has not yet been an operating system or a technology that hasn 't been hacked .
it was proceeding at moore 's law pace , but then in 2008 , something changed .
just saying . just think about that .
whether or not you realize it , we are at the dawn of a technological arms race , an arms race between people who are using technology for good and those who are using it for ill .
why has all this focus on security made me feel so much more insecure ?
you must fight anyone who encroaches upon it .
i 've been in bosnian refugee camps .
and , i love this story so much .
she had this amazing box that she carried and it had a torso of a woman 's body in it , a half a torso , and she would teach people , everywhere she went , what a healthy vagina looked like and what a mutilated vagina looked like .
i didn 't know where i was going , where i 'd come from , and i panicked . i had a total anxiety attack .
imagine that you 've been raped and you 're bringing up a boy child .
unless you 're like me and you leave the handle in the position of hot even when you turn it on , and then you start to use more energy .
if we put aluminum windows in this house , we would double the energy use right there .
but all the calculations for embodied energy are on the blog .
and counting off by four ?
one-two-three-four , one-two-three .
all : triplet-triplet .
there can be no evolutionary advantage to laying down memories of childhood or perceiving the color of a rose if it doesn 't affect the way you 're going to move later in life .
now why is that top problem so easy and the bottom problem so hard ?
we have no idea what is going on inside her brain when she does that , and that 's what we 'd like to know .
so if you 're lucky enough to be able to knock a small white ball into a hole several hundred yards away using a long metal stick , our society will be willing to reward you with hundreds of millions of dollars .
i 'm not going to explain what that formula is , but it 's very beautiful .
and moreover , it profoundly changes your perceptions by what you do .
so as i go around the world , i 'm making predictions of what i should get , subtracting them off .
and by 0.2 of a second , it 's equivalently ticklish to the robot that just tickled you without you doing anything .
and so here 's player one and player two sitting opposite to each other .
so it could be bridged in infinitely many different ways .
so what is it about a movement which is good or bad ?
and hopefully if we understand how we control movement , we can apply that to robotic technology .
what if we could prevent electrical fires before they start ?
now , besides saving lives , perhaps the greatest benefit of intelligent power is in its energy savings .
and this machine is able to enable surgery and save lives because it was designed with this environment in mind .
similarly compressed oxygen and other medical supplies are really a luxury and can often be out of stock for months or even a year .
and after umpteen surgeries and , you can imagine , really unspeakable tragedy , he just said , " that 's it . i 'm done . that 's enough .
the only difference is that now you 're only working with 21 percent oxygen .
but we 're not content to stop there .
thank you very much .
this is a diagram of the u.s. counterinsurgency strategy in afghanistan .
and i 'm going to play some songs for you tonight that are , literally , world premieres .
so this is called " tembererana . "
yeah , i kind of felt sorry for him .
if my room back home had looked like this , my mother would have grounded me for three days .
i just realized it 's important how one introduces new ideas to people , that 's why these patents are sometimes necessary .
one can see here quite clearly , you can see we have 25 pale green elements , of which one is in the form of a circle .
so after a while i decided to have a little fun , and before leaving the room each day i 'd scatter a few things around the space .
but yeah , and it 's great , you can even go , you know -- or we have this pointillist movement for those of you who are into art .
here -- that 's just my new proposal here for the union jack .
some sick and twisted people have found themselves snorting galvao .
next to japan , it 's the second most represented by population .
now for me , i 'm surprised by this , because this wasn 't how the internet was supposed to be .
it 's actually a place that we probably should be paying attention to at the moment .
the world is , in fact , getting more global .
even within wikipedias , where we 're creating their own content online , there 's a heavy bias towards the place where a lot of the wikipedia authors are based , rather than to the rest of the world .
but the more that i think about it , the more that i think that a few things that we have learned along the way are interesting lessons for how we would rewire if we we wanted to use the web to have a wider world .
what you really want -- what i really want , is eventually the ability to push a button and have this queued so a human being can translate this .
and it 's very , very hard to get information from the other flocks , from the other parts of the world where people getting together and talking about their own interests .
and when you look at this image , you might find yourself going , " why would i conceivably care about this ? "
it 's because , for him , sport is the language that allows him to encounter the full width and wonder of the world .
actually , that whole row isn 't right .
because i didn 't think of that .
so actually , it 's filled with 100 billion neurons just zizzing away , electrically transmitting information , zizzing , zizzing . i 'm going to give you a little side view here .
so kitty cat , meow , happy happy happy , human beings , screwed .
okay , here we go .
thank you .
the answer is ?
it makes no sense . companies make their expensive executives spend ages carefully preparing forecasts and budgets which are obsolete or need changing before they can be published .
what we do know is that the world has accelerated .
what he did was , he got a transparent pipe — have you seen this demonstration before ? — he attached it to a tap . so effectively what you had was , you had a situation where — i 'll try and draw the tap and the pipe , actually i 'll skip the tap . the taps are hard .
so i 'll put a little line up here which represents learning , and that 's how we used to do it . we could see things , understand them , take the time to put them into practice .
it 's called smart failure . why ? because you can 't put it on your c.v.
rabin 's statement was a reflection of decades of security and intelligence collaboration between the two , which in turn was born out of perception of common threats .
the easiest target was the peace process , and now the iranian ideological bark was to be accompanied by a nonconventional bite , and iran began supporting extensively palestinian islamist groups that it previously had shunned .
who will risk peace ?
in the bird outbreaks we now can see that pretty much the whole world has seen this virus except the americas .
how do you get them mobilized around the world if you 've shut all the airports down ?
half the states would run out of hospital beds in the first week , maybe two weeks .
unfortunately it 's made against the current form of h5n1 .
your insurance payments didn 't go through .
and we now have seen tamiflu-resistant strains in both vietnam in person-to-person transmission , and in egypt in person-to-person transmission .
most of the death toll was 15 to 40 year-olds -- robustly healthy young adults .
but really ? do you really have a place to stockpile 18 months worth of food ? twenty-four months worth of food ?
but we don 't really know how and why that happens .
i 'm thinking dipstick .
and along comes pneumococcus or another bacteria , streptococcus and boom , they get a bacterial pneumonia .
vannevar bush was the u.s. government 's chief scientific adviser during the war .
he built a system .
the magazines started to cover it .
in 1993 , there was a table at the conference in seattle , and a guy called marc andreessen was demonstrating his little browser for the world wide web .
this is the launch of my book .
and it 's really unfair to humanity , because humanity is actually much more cooperative and empathic than given credit for .
so one of the two is not really interested in the task anymore .
and so they come together , they arrive together , they pick it up together and they pull together .
and the emotional part .
and there 's a chimpanzee watching , an actual real chimpanzee watching a computer screen on which we play these animations .
and here you have the two color tokens .
and so we found that the chimpanzees do care about the well-being of somebody else -- especially , these are other members of their own group .
the first piece she eats .
so we 're getting very close to the human sense of fairness .
well , the course i was and am teaching is called cellular and molecular neuroscience - i.
so i thought , well , maybe i should teach a course on ignorance , something i can finally excel at , perhaps , for example .
i have to get out of here actually . i have to go read .
we can chip away at this iceberg and figure out what it is , or we could just wait for it to melt , i suppose , these days , but one way or another we could get to the whole iceberg . right ?
it 's what makes a good question .
so , for example , we could say , well what is it that the brain does ?
perhaps it ought to be walking on two legs , or the motor system .
this is a tricky thing . this is not such an easy business .
this can 't possibly continue to go on .
well , i learned a lot of things about ballooning , especially at the end of these balloon flights around the world i did with brian jones .
how do we go from the metaphor to something more practical that we can really use every day ?
this can be in environment , in finance , in education of children .
and then he asked me -- and this is something i will never forget in my life -- he just asked me , " you 're the good pilot up there .
but if i show you this picture it 's not to tell you how happy we were .
what is today completely impossible -- get rid of our dependency on fossil energy .
we launched the project with my colleague andre borschberg six years ago .
so , you see that this airplane is more a symbol .
but much more , to get advices , to give your comments , to spread the word that if it 's possible in the air , of course it 's possible in the ground .
it really was a big idea in technology when we started applying it in the ibot for the disabled community .
500 years ago , sailing ships started getting reliable enough ; we found a new continent .
i mean , what are we fighting over right now ?
i have the same footprint as a pedestrian ; i have the same unique capability to deal with other pedestrians in a crowded space .
and the camera is looking down at her .
you do it in your sneakers .
the number one cause of death on this planet among humans is bad water .
of course , the verdict is not definitive .
because of quantum tunneling , i could disappear from this room and reappear in the next room , practically penetrating the wall .
our calculations showed that the measured value of the higgs boson mass is very special .
then the key to the mystery could lie in the statistical properties of the multiverse .
this is where it began .
and this is how we began .
that statistic is so sad .
it 's not my eeg at cedars ; it 's your eeg tonight and last night .
and during that process -- it took many years -- one of the doctors said that my recovery , my degree of advance , since the amount of head injury i 'd suffered , was miraculous .
it meant that when i was given two and a half hours to take a test that anyone here would take in 50 minutes , i might score an f.
the craniomandibular system is critical to that .
using this technology , this is mapping in three dimensions .
the main unit will then go inside the brain .
and so i was sitting in this restaurant , waiting for a man to come by who obviously would have some difficulty ...
underneath my heel , there is a sensor that detects when my foot leaves the ground -- what 's called the heel lift .
he 's done a lot of very cutting-edge science .
so how do i make something that even a kid can use ?
so you have situations like this , where some people in chile decided to make their own boards instead of buying them , to organize a workshop and to save money . or there are companies that make their own variations of arduino that fit in a certain market , and there 's probably , maybe like a 150 of them or something at the moment .
it 's also used , arduino 's used , in serious places like , you know , the large hadron collider .
or somebody made a chair that twitters when somebody farts .
so the idea is that the hardware , the software , the design of the object , the fabrication , everything about this project is open-source and you can make it yourself .
every morning , i wake up and i look at all the stuff that google alerts sends me , and it 's just amazing . it 's just going into every field that you can imagine .
the q & amp ; a session after a post-op presents data is often a blood bath .
now that 's not the only reason that we think this person is an idiot .
and what you find is , of course , people who eat veg and olive oil have fewer skin wrinkles .
so there 's no control ; there 's no control group .
so firstly , trials against placebo : everybody thinks they know that a trial should be a comparison of your new drug against placebo .
and yet , they always manage to to get the result that they want .
so you can see here that the small negative trials that should be on the bottom left have disappeared .
but the companies withheld that data from them , and so did the european medicines agency for three years .
so i always want to tell the story , like , one hand it is that , the other hand is that .
one is the internet , the other is the chinanet .
sometimes the arab dictators didn 't understand these two hands .
and later this year , the rail minister was sacked and sentenced to jail for 10 years .
it even has its own name , with weibo .
if you -- so a sad story will be picked up by her .
they have everything in their hands .
something will happen behind it .
we chinese fight for our freedom , you just watch your bad cats .
when i mention mushrooms to somebody , they immediately think portobellos or magic mushrooms , their eyes glaze over , and they think i 'm a little crazy .
i 've been a scanning electron microscopist for many years , i have thousands of electron micrographs , and when i 'm staring at the mycelium , i realize that they are microfiltration membranes .
most of you may not know that fungi were the first organisms to come to land .
the earth was struck by an asteroid , a huge amount of debris was jettisoned into the atmosphere .
some of these mushrooms are very happy mushrooms .
it 's a mushroom exclusive to the old-growth forest that dioscorides first described in 65 a.d.
here 's the selectivity index numbers -- against pox , you saw 10s and 20s -- now against flu viruses , compared to the ribavirin controls , we have an extraordinarily high activity .
so , you have a near-permanent solution for reinvasion of termites .
i add mycelium to it , and then i inoculate the corncobs .
this is just a couple of them from january 17th , last year .
what is the veracity level of what you 're looking at ?
and it 's a community around it that has decided to build this .
it was six miles offshore and 1,250 feet down .
no matter where on earth you live .
consider this : starting right here at the convention center , we can find the nearby aquarium , we can look at where we 're sitting , and then we can cruise up the coast to the big aquarium , the ocean , and california 's four national marine sanctuaries , and the new network of state marine reserves that are beginning to protect and restore some of the assets we can flit over to hawaii and see the real hawaiian islands : not just the little bit that pokes through the surface , but also what 's below .
we 're putting hundreds of millions of tons of plastic and other trash into the sea .
there are a few oysters in chesapeake bay .
such as the arctic -- we have one chance , right now , to get it right .
and so , i suppose you want to know what my wish is .
but after four years the grim truth seeps out .
and she spoke some vietnamese , as a child having grown up with vietnamese friends .
last year , the khmer rouge tribunal , which the u.n. is helping cambodia take on , started , and i decided that as a matter of record i should file a civil complaint with the tribunal about my father 's passing away .
and at some point the dutch police came into amsterdam and arrested van meegeren .
and he killed himself soon afterwards .
so i want to suggest that pleasure is deep -- and that this isn 't true just for higher level pleasures like art , but even the most seemingly simple pleasures are affected by our beliefs about hidden essences .
everybody , of course , drinks exactly the same wine .
but there 's at least one case where capgras syndrome had a happy ending .
so in one of our experiments , we asked people to name a famous person who they adored , a living person they adored .
the original is typically the product of a creative act , the forgery isn 't .
not bad . it 's also not good .
there 's no malevolence , they 're just pressing a button .
and i grew up in this little farming town in northern nevada .
and then i started conducting , and i ended up doing my master 's degree at the juilliard school .
afterwards , i played a piano track underneath so that the singers would have something to listen to .
this is " lux aurumque " sung by the virtual choir .
beau awtin : safe in bed ew : and our goal -- it was sort of an arbitrary goal -- there was an mtv video where they all sang " lollipop " and they got people from all over the world to just sing that little melody .
as i am in the great alaskan bush , satellite is my connection to the world . "
the question of transformation in africa really is a question of leadership .
and so three months later , just before she returned to the united states , nurses in accra go on strike .
no sign to this effect .
they wanted us to be concerned about social issues .
and those leaders did not emerge spontaneously .
and it was the same -- learning by rote -- from primary school through graduate school .
but i was moved almost to tears because i understood what was happening to this young man .
it says a lot about the culture that 's forming on campus .

what if we thought of fear as an amazing act of the imagination , something that can be as profound and insightful as storytelling itself ?
now the last option was the longest , and the most difficult : to sail 1,500 miles due south in hopes of reaching a certain band of winds that could eventually push them toward the coast of south america .
in other words , our fears make us think about the future .
i think the end of the story of the whaleship essex offers an illuminating , if tragic , example .
read in the right way , our fears are an amazing gift of the imagination , a kind of everyday clairvoyance , a way of glimpsing what might be the future when there 's still time to influence how that future will play out .
interestingly enough , other neurologic diseases which affect very different parts of the brain also show tangles of misfolded protein , which suggests that the approach might be a general one , and might be used to cure many neurologic diseases , not just alzheimer 's disease .
that 's a lot .
floor : sustainable , recyclable .
here 's a great little example .
it was like vegetable jerky , and killed all of them .
very advanced , no air-conditioning -- i love it .
so i 'm committing to potatoes ; i 'm committing to milk ; i 'm committing to leeks and broccoli -- all very important stuff .
thank you very much .
i 'll begin in 1824 .
it began carrying , among other things , a large number of hunters who began the wholesale killing of buffalo , eliminating a source of food and clothing and shelter for the sioux .
communal ownership of reservation lands ends .
because it was in this moment with the fingers on the triggers of the hotchkiss guns that the u.s. government openly declared its position on native rights .
more than 90 percent of the population lives below the federal poverty line .
and how much of this history do you need to own , even ?
this , in a way , is one of the challenges of how to interpret a really good idea .
in judaism , though , we tend to always say , there has to be a middle way .
and so there is also , within judaism , this notion of love and kindness that becomes very important : " chesed . "
and they say " it 's 18 minutes . "
he goes into the synagogue . " god , will you please help me ?
" you mean god didn 't want my bread ? "
later on , i earned an mba at stanford .
i began doing tasks around the house .
chad jenkins : henry , all joking aside , i bet all of these people here would love to see you fly this drone from your bed in california 3,000 miles away .
thank you .
in fact , you can find that the lack of basic resources , material resources , contributes to unhappiness , but the increase in material resources does not increase happiness .
now he says also that this is so intense an experience that it feels almost as if he didn 't exist .
and it describes the same effortless , spontaneous feeling that you get when you enter into this ecstatic state .
in our studies , we represent the everyday life of people in this simple scheme .
the largest single contributor to that experience is watching television ; the next one is being in the bathroom , sitting .
i was fascinated with the absence of light , and i wanted to find a way that i could give it materiality and pin it down before it changed .
even harder was getting paint to stick to the acid in a grapefruit .
as the highest military commander of the netherlands , with troops stationed around the world , i 'm really honored to be here today .
you could even hear it .
the story of what happened when he was a conscripted soldier in the dutch armed forces at the beginning of the second world war .
so this story stayed with me .
well we were talking on the human mind this morning .
it is this participation in peacekeeping missions that has led to the resolution of many civil wars .
i hope you will support the efforts of our armed forces to train soldiers like this young captain and provide her with a good gun , instead of the bad gun my father was given .
it 's basically two ratios of per capita gdp , per capita gross domestic product , so average income .
so it really doesn 't look like empire is a great explanation for the great divergence .
it 's the ideas .
it 's the same with institutions .
in fact , they demolish taqi al-din 's observatory , because it 's considered blasphemous to inquire into the mind of god .
you 've all bought an article of clothing in the last month ; i guarantee it .
in terms of patents , there 's no question that the east is ahead .
now this picture shows the demolition of the chinese artist ai weiwei 's studio in shanghai earlier this year .
niall ferguson : well i really am not just talking about the rise of the east ; i 'm talking about the rise of the rest , and that includes south america .
i 'm not at all a cook .
and i think it is because we feel that this kind of bread really is about authenticity .
and even sort of horrible things , like picking beans by hand , can now be done automatically .
as food became plentiful here , it also meant that we were able to decrease the number of people working in agriculture to something like , on average , in the high income countries , five percent or less of the population .
and large-scale has meant destruction of many of our landscapes , destruction of biodiversity -- still a lonely emu here in the brazilian cerrado soybean fields .
if we do this , if we want to stay with traditional small-scale farming we are going , actually , to relegate these poor farmers and their husbands -- among whom i have lived for many years , working without electricity and water , to try to improve their food production -- we relegate them to poverty .
you cannot ask people to work under these conditions .
use biotechnology where useful , particularly in pest and disease resistance .
so this is not science fiction . we can combine things even in a social sense of making the rural areas more accessible to people -- to house , for example , the chronically sick .
he did not speak about rice , in india . he said , " to those who have to go without two meals a day , god can only appear as bread . "
as we know , babies are born without their full muscle development , and that includes the brain .
the newly admitted babies would cry for the first few hours , but their demands were not met , and so eventually they learned not to bother . within a few days , they were listless , lethargic , and staring into space like all the others .
the institution may be hundreds of miles away from the family home .

if you know anything about anatomy , that 's not a good thing to get cut , and everything , of course , on the way up , and then — i still had my hands up — he pulled it out and went for my neck , and sunk it in up to the hilt in my neck , and i got one straight right punch and knocked the middle guy out .
and it 's my zipper , and i 've still got the staples in and everything .
by and large , it did not work .
just see the contrast .
and all those phones were in the few urban places .
let 's say i 'm a fisherman and a farmer .
so then the question is , why can 't we have some kind of shared access ?
and so they were not that interested to connect all their branches , and then to be -- and rock the boat .
but we are also investing around another 300 million dollars this year to extend that coverage .
their involvement reduces the cost .
i mean , you have 100 billion nerve cells , little wisps of protoplasm , interacting with each other , and from this activity emerges the whole spectrum of abilities that we call human nature and human consciousness .
she 's some other woman pretending to be my mother . "
normally , visual signals come in , into the eyeballs , go to the visual areas in the brain .
but because the wire is cut to the emotional centers , he says , " but how come , if it 's my mother , i don 't experience a warmth ? "
the reason is there 's a separate pathway going from the hearing centers in the brain to the emotional centers , and that 's not been cut by the accident .
the phantom limb -- they 'll say , " but doctor , the phantom limb is paralyzed .
now , how do you help these patients ?
my first patient came in , and he looked in the mirror , and i said , " look at your reflection of your phantom . "
maybe , after a period of practice , you can dispense with the mirror , unlearn the paralysis , and start moving your paralyzed arm , and then , relieve yourself of pain . "
and your motor command saying there is an arm , and , because of this conflict , the brain says , to hell with it , there is no phantom , there is no arm , right ?
why does this happen ?
that gives you the clue .
different shapes for different phonemes , right ?
thank you .
it is rich in mineral resources , natural mineral resources .
yes , put that aside .
kwame nkrumah , nyerere , kenyatta -- somebody mentioned idi amin .
the third fundamental issue that we have to recognize is that if we want to help the african people , we must know where the african people are .
first one is the political system .
the " we " connotes community -- the extended family system .
go back to africa 's indigenous institutions , and this is where we charge the cheetahs to go into the informal sectors , the traditional sectors .
we were able to mobilize ghanaians in the diaspora to instigate change in ghana and bring about democracy in ghana .
and we put everything on the line to make that stuff happen .
and we all decided to start these things because it 's really the only place we fit .
but as an entrepreneur you don 't do accounting , you hire accountants .
and i was calling all the dry cleaners in winnipeg to find out how much would the dry cleaners pay me for coat hangers .
but i was convinced i was going to get him to buy a license plate protector .
go get some of that . and i learned that at a young age .
strangely enough , 30 years later , we 're building 1-800-got-junk ?
remember , i was being groomed to do this . i was not allowed to have jobs .
you just pick them up with both feet .
yeah , but you know what ? you stuff that down your shorts , when you go into a football game you can get booze in for free , everybody bought them .
and then they don 't have a regular check , but they have more opportunities to find more stuff , and they learn the skill of negotiating , and they learn the skill of finding opportunities as well .
show them the grumpy employees .
when steve jurvetson and jim clark and jim barksdale have all got it , and they built netscape -- imagine if they were given ritalin .
he said , " it 's a what ? "
and in about 1997 , the then-director philippe de montebello gave me the go-ahead to organize an exhibition for 2002 . we normally have these very long lead-in times .
that was an interesting case .
it gives us a way of reaching out to audiences around the globe , but nothing replaces the authenticity of the object presented with passionate scholarship .
richard feynman compared the accuracy of quantum theories -- experimental predictions -- to specifying the width of north america to within one hair 's breadth of accuracy .
science has taught us , against all intuition , that apparently solid things , like crystals and rocks , are really almost entirely composed of empty space .
i have every reason to think it 's true ; i was reading playboy because i , myself , had an article in it .
not a single atom that is in your body today was there when that event took place . matter flows from place to place and momentarily comes together to be you .
dogs can distinguish two very similar fatty acids , extremely diluted : caprylic acid and caproic acid .
could make some sort of landmark points along a spectrum of improbability , which might look like the electromagnetic spectrum we just looked at .
treating people as machines may be scientifically and philosophically accurate , but it 's a cumbersome waste of time if you want to guess what this person is going to do next .
to put these numbers in perspective , this is eight times larger than the number of casualties in the iraq and afghanistan wars combined .
the only thing that the cartels are doing is that they 're trying to protect their business .
that includes kidnapping , prostitution , local drug dealing and human trafficking , including of migrants that go from the south to the u.s.
and the mexican borders , but now they have grown into a truly integrated multinational that has partnerships in production in the south and partnerships in global distribution across the planet .
these organizations service , recruit from , and operate within our communities , so necessarily , they are much more integrated within them than we are comfortable acknowledging .
so i said , " you know , i really don 't want to write about my research .
no , right ? it 's impossible .
but again it 's the same story that if we take the background away , the illusion comes back . right .
or maybe it is about religion .
the countries on the right , the ones that give a lot , have a slightly different form .
it 's not because it 's trivial . it 's not because we don 't care .
or do you let them go and have hip replacement ? "
or a weekend in paris ?
and i called them up . and they went to check what was going on .
people believe that when we deal with physical attraction , we see somebody , and we know immediately whether we like them or not , attracted or not .
what is the general point ?
and he had a real passion for golf , and he also created this whole mythology about ben hogan and various things .
so this next part is really a way of understanding space and rhythm , with the obvious reference to the feet , but it 's also time -- where the feet were , where the balls were .
but that 's the closest approximation i can have to it .
you 're not getting off that easy . all right ?
one learning process that i see is this -- ok . another learning process that i see is this -- ok . so , everybody take a deep breath in , breath out . ok .
why the hell should i learn this ? ok ?
excuse me , still getting there . a moment that travels .
to have a conversation with it . to speak . to listen .
now , what i just did was i worked with the mathematics -- the diameter and the circumference .
for work in three dimensions , with your perceptions of space and time .
and then we have the sensual factor of the face .
she 's also in danger , when she damages this , of bleeding profusely .
i 'd like you all in the audience now to push your lower jaw forward .
so this is a photograph of henry , two weeks after he had a malignant cancer removed from the left side of his face -- his cheekbone , his upper jaw , his eye-socket .
his facial disfigurement did not affect him because he had the support of a family ; he had a successful , fulfilling job .
their identity doesn 't change .
would we be happy if our doctor 's face , our lawyer 's face , our financial adviser 's face was covered ?
we put it in place so we knew it was an accurate position .
so the better news is the future 's almost here -- and the future is tissue engineering .
so , let 's roll the video .
and i 'm delighted to see a great competition between the u.k. in blue , and the u.s. in red .
this is january , in time lapse , of people editing ... that 's the earthquake .
the gentleman to my left is the very famous , perhaps overly famous , frank gehry .
and actually , it was responding to clients that i had who didn 't have very much money , so they couldn 't afford very much .
obviously , over time i have a lot more confidence that it 's going to be ok .
fg : that will be finished in 2003 -- september , october -- and i 'm hoping kyu , and herbie , and yo-yo and all those guys come play with us at that place .
i mean , charlie moore did a bunch of it , but it didn 't feel good to me .
it 's not his money , of course .
and i think everybody -- i mean that should be a matter of fact , like gravity .
so , some years later i was doing a building , a little house on the beach for norton simon , and his secretary , who was kind of a hell on wheels type lady , called me and said , " mr. simon 's sitting at his desk and the water 's coming in on his head . "
since bilbao opened , which is now four , five years , both krens and i have been called with at least 100 opportunities -- china , brazil , other parts of spain -- to come in and do the bilbao effect .
" you 're not going to have dinner at all ? "
fantastic tales , anecdotes from speakers .
and turnarounds are part and parcel of what i have focused on for most of my professional career .
i went to the siwa oasis . that was one of my stops .
it was george kimble , the geographer , who said that , " the only thing dark about africa is our ignorance of it . "
but that 's just part of the story . you have a similar trend with currencies -- currencies going through an extreme time of stability .
but what were they there for ? to acquire assets .
it 's an important strategic partner .
again , opportunity to tackle markets to get that higher price .
if i had to ask you , " in 2005 what was the best performing stock market or stock exchange in the world ? " would egypt come to mind ?
so one of the big bellwethers , and one of my final points i want to mention , is the interesting thing i read is that cnbc has launched their first african channel . why is cnbc doing this ?
this gives us genetic diversity , or at least it gives the plants genetic diversity .
first of all , pollen is tiny . yes we know that .
okay , so this is another species evolved to be dispersed by insects .
so , you can tell from a piece of clothing to within about a kilometer or so , where that piece of clothing has been recently and then send in dogs .
and it 's really in this combined way that you get an overall sense of what 's going on , because there 's a lot of complex things like medicaid and research money that flow across those boundaries .
that is , through various gimmicks and things , a so-called balanced budget had led him to have 25 billion missing out of the 76 billion in proposed spending .
and california 's not unique .
technology has a role to play .
so what do we need to do ?
but we have to draw those people in , because this is about education .
they spent about two years reviewing that independently and published their results in science in 1999 .
i think philosophically , that was one of the most important papers that we 've ever done because it showed how dynamic life was .
because of the problems with mycoplasma genitalium and its slow growth about a year and a half ago , we decided to synthesize the much larger chromosome , the mycoides chromosome , knowing that we had the biology worked out on that for transplantation .
so the code that mike montague and the team developed actually puts frequent stop codons , so it 's a different alphabet but allows us to use the entire english alphabet with punctuation and numbers .
craig venter : can we explain how significant this is ?
now , there is a sound -- -- aah , it worked -- a sound that is desperately , desperately familiar to most of us , and of course it 's the sound of the alarm clock .
and of course the infamous -- what was his name ? -- the infamous gordon gekko from " wall street " said , " money never sleeps . "
the biological clock tells us when it 's good to be up , when it 's good to be asleep , and what that structure does is interact with a whole raft of other areas within the hypothalamus , the lateral hypothalamus , the ventrolateral preoptic nuclei .
if you compare an individual who has slept at night , or stayed awake and hasn 't moved very much , the energy saving of sleeping is about 110 calories a night .
so let 's now look at sleep deprivation .
at another level of terror , we dip into the tragic accidents at chernobyl and indeed the space shuttle challenger , which was so tragically lost .
the brain says , " i need carbohydrates , " and what it does is seek out carbohydrates and particularly sugars .
listen to them . listen to yourself .
that 's an average . some people need more . some people need less .
other groups showed no 24-hour patterns whatsoever .
and the third , which i think is the most exciting , is that we can think of the sleep centers within the brain as a new therapeutic target .
so , i said , " yeah , yeah , age of reason . what does that mean again ? "
plus , why would santa save time by having to loop back to our house after he 'd gone to everybody else 's ?
what was so upsetting about this new piece of information was not that i was going to have to change the date of my slumber party with all of my girlfriends , what was most upsetting was that this meant that i was not a virgo .
ok . so i sat them down and i got them glasses of water , and after niceties they said , " do you believe that god loves you with all his heart ? "
and they said , " well , they became our native americans here in the u.s. "
or , if you 'd gone blind , you could see . "
it 's going to change the way we do astronomy , it 's going to change the way we teach astronomy and i think most importantly it 's going to change the way we see ourselves in the universe .
before i introduce the person responsible for the worldwide telescope , i just want to leave you with this brief thought : when i ask people , " how does the night sky make you feel ? "
i have had the distinct pleasure of living inside two biospheres .
and so we decided that what it really is is that it is entirely materially closed -- that is , nothing goes in or out at all , no material -- and energetically open , which is essentially what planet earth is .
and then also we had the human habitat of course , with the laboratories , and all of that .
we stopped tilling , so that we could prevent greenhouse gasses from going into the air .
except that i knew i could walk out the airlock door at any time , if it really got bad , though who was going to say , " i can 't take it anymore ! " ?
people stink !
as a result of that modeling i ended up in all places , in eritrea , in the horn of africa .
and as i was modeling this mangrove swamp , i was thinking to myself , " how do you put a box around this ? "
and they like to keep everything beautifully raked . and they keep all the leaves away .
breath does , in fact , connect us all in a very literal way .
now , scoop up long 's peak , and put it out in space .
but it won 't wipe out , you know , all life on earth , so that 's fine . but it turns out , you don 't need something six miles across to do a lot of damage .
but they will do global economic damage , because they don 't have to hit , necessarily , to do this kind of damage .
nasa has devoted money to this .
comets are very much like asteroids .
and you can hit it again . that 's kind of ham-fisted . you might just push it into a third keyhole or whatever , so you don 't do that .
if anybody here is a fan of the original " star trek , " they ran across an alien ship that had an ion drive , and spock said , " they 're very technically sophisticated .
love and respect -- that 's what the whole film was about .
not only do i drink coffee , i know other gay people who drink coffee .
and he says , " i want to spend the rest of my life with you . "
i 've paid my dues on time , i 've marched in gay pride flags parades and the whole nine , and i 've yet to see a copy of the gay agenda .
did you know that in all the states where there is no shading that people who are gay , lesbian , bisexual or transgendered can be kicked out of their apartments for being gay , lesbian , bisexual or transgendered ?
he has a 4.0 .
and they should be treated with love and respect .
my favorite of these photos , which i couldn 't find , is there 's a picture of a 30 year-old woman or so with a little baby on her lap , and the next photo is a 220-lb man with a tiny , little old lady peaking over his shoulder .
and i asked my audience , i said , " listen to this piece of audio .
so but anyways , here 's the thing -- is it reminds me of this , which is a sign that you see in amsterdam on every street corner .
" right after he told me and my brother he was going to be separating from my mom , i remember walking to a convenience store and getting a cherry cola . "
you can look at it online .
and i asked people to send me beautiful things made out of the angrigami .
and the person who didn 't , it turned out , had just moved to a new city and taken on a new job .
i just want to say thanks for even considering it . "
to test water , you simply insert a sample and , within seconds , it either displays a red light , indicating contaminated water , or a green light , indicating the sample is safe .
i am not a luddite .
and he says , " and did you take the shortcut down inverleith row to get here to the infirmary ? "
he began to tap on the chests of his patients , on their abdomens .
and fildes was so taken by the physician who held vigil at the bedside for two , three nights , that he decided that he would try and depict the physician in our time -- almost a tribute to this physician .
one had to do with a friend of mine who had a breast cancer , had a small breast cancer detected -- had her lumpectomy in the town in which i lived .
i say that because these are difficult patients .
the bad news is we don 't know exactly what 's causing this , but here 's what you should do , here 's what we should do . "
i would pull down the eyelids .
and the message , which i didn 't fully understand then , even as i delivered it , and which i understand better now is this : i will always , always , always be there .
but for those 20 years , an unbelievable number of really eminent and accomplished figures in the wine world were sort of drawn into the orbit of these bottles .
one of the most expensive luxury foods by weight in the world .
30,000 dollars for a night in a hotel .
a recurring theme is that a lot of these things are from japan -- you 'll start to notice .
the seat is preheated .
and it was really amazing .
and then i got an email from a guy named bipin desai .
thank you .
i gave them a computer with a speech-to-text interface , which you now get free with windows , and asked them to speak into it .
boy : ... just mention , i play games like animals , and i listen to music .
the first experiment i did out of newcastle was actually done in india .
and then that 's her over there .
i made them into groups of four .
a single child in front of a single computer will not do that .
they wanted to be footballers before .
there was silence for a while , then they said , " you 've spelled it wrong .
we crave to be in the room with the musician the day it was recorded , the day it was played .
was a beloved pianist , maybe the great cult pianist of the twentieth century .
that 's the original . [ unclear ] that 's the two together .
the whole process is very sensitive to temperature and humidity .
but i believe we 're on a path now , when we get to data , that we can distill styles , and templates , and formulas , and all these kinds of things , again , that you 've seen happen in the computer graphics world .
we made a new recording of him playing in the shrine auditorium in september .
and a sandbox for new ideas about evolution . "
this is in nature : it overrides a carnivorous nature and what otherwise would have been a short fight to the death .
and i 'd like you to think that every bit of more complex play builds on this base for us humans .
now one of the things about play is that it is born by curiosity and exploration .
i 'm telling you a story today about play .
so what happens ?
i think we 've got a lot of learning to do .
summers were hard , hard work , in the heat of tennessee summers .
but it doesn 't have to be that way .
and its hugely important in learning and crafting the brain .
and i intend to focus on most of the world 's land that is turning to desert .
now we know that desertification is caused by livestock , mostly cattle , sheep and goats , overgrazing the plants , leaving the soil bare and giving off methane .
and i found that american scientists had no explanation for this except that it is arid and natural .
but fire also leaves the soil bare , releasing carbon , and worse than that , burning one hectare of grassland gives off more , and more damaging , pollutants than 6,000 cars .
but we biologists and ecologists had never tackled anything as complex as this .
this land in mexico was in terrible condition , and i 've had to mark the hill because the change is so profound .
when you first start this and you bring in a flock of animals , it 's desert . what do they eat ? how does that part work ?
it helps them suggest books for me to read or movies for my family to watch or friends for us to connect with .
and she , of course , naturally as a nine-year-old , looked at me and said quizzically , " what 's literacy ? "
this is no longer me being a tech pioneer or a privacy advocate ; this is me being a parent .
a couple of years ago , i read an article by new york times writer michael pollan in which he argued that growing even some of our own food is one of the best things that we can do for the environment .
so actually now on this website , we have 18,000 people .
if we really want to see the kind of wide consumer behavior change that we 're all talking about as environmentalists and food people , maybe we just need to ditch the term " consumer " and get behind the people who are doing stuff .
here , an overhead video camera is recording me as i 'm talking and drawing on a piece of paper .
but if you can do it any time , that means you can do it tomorrow , and if you can do it tomorrow , well , you may not ever get around to it .
it 's a really exciting time .
out in the hall with their crocodile tears ; now that you 're out of it , now that you 're leaving , now that they 've sealed your arse and your ears , what i 've been meaning to tell you for years , and years , and years , and years , old friend ...
never go back . never go back .
turn your pillow . dry your tears .
america is an empire .
or hollywood 's siren call ?
their trinkets and baubles cost little enough .
but sometimes i try to put myself in that position .
and i am as bad as you .
we craved but to favor the hem of her dress .
he 'd been a miner .
in fact , she became so annoying as she kept insisting on telling this story to her neighbors , to her friends , to other people in the community , that eventually a bunch of them got together and they made a bumper sticker , which they proudly displayed on their cars , which said , " yes , i 'm from libby , montana , and no , i don 't have asbestosis . "
you could see them in banks when interest rates were manipulated and everyone around knew what was going on , but everyone studiously ignored it .
and the recurrent theme that i encounter all the time is people say , " well , you know , the people who do see , they 're whistleblowers , and we all know what happens to them . "
and what they 're very prepared to do is recognize that yes , this is going to be an argument , and yes i 'm going to have a lot of rows with my neighbors and my colleagues and my friends , but i 'm going to become very good at this conflict .
and it 's from this woman who you kind of know from down the hall , and the subject line references some project that you heard a little bit about .
it goes on for about five minutes , and it has all the things that we hate about really bad meetings .
and in fact , some of the biggest companies in the world , companies that you 've heard of but i won 't name , have asked for my permission to use this video in their new-hire training to teach their new employees how not to run a meeting at their company .
it 's right next to the accept button .
and then he had to clarify that he wasn 't talking about them .
that he asked for only one thing -- a gift of two healthy sperm whales ?
i remember , for some reason , that they were exactly the same height .
" kew , kew , kew -- watch out . "
first of all , i was embarrassed because i had not read the novel " dune " at that time .
close encounter three : philadelphia , pennsylvania , 1989 .
close encounter four : the algarve , portugal , 1991 .
it took me some time to come to my senses .
the stars aligned , and she came back .
" she is going to a lecture . "
helplessly and hopelessly , i began to retreat into this nightmarish inner world in which the voices were destined to become both my persecutors and my only perceived companions .
now , at first , this was very difficult to believe , not least because the voices appeared so hostile and menacing , so in this respect , a vital first step was learning to separate out a metaphorical meaning from what i 'd previously interpreted to be a literal truth .
and all the while , i listened to my voices , with whom i 'd finally learned to live with peace and respect and which in turn reflected a growing sense of compassion , acceptance and respect towards myself .
hi , everybody .
changing your perspectives will not only transform you but also the whole world .
and probably , if i were to fill out jim citrin 's scale , i 'd put 100 percent on the side of the equation where you spend time making it possible for others to be creative .
but one thing we learned was that these kids can absolutely jump into it just the same way as our kids do here .
i can see any head of state , any executive i want , at any time , because i 'm not selling laptops . ok ? i have no shareholders .
dual-mode display -- that sunlight display 's fantastic .
if you 're in the jungle , it 's about 500 meters . so if a kid bicycles home , or walks a few miles , they 're going to be off the grid , so to speak .
and so i went to each of those countries at least six times , met with the head of state probably two or three times .
we said it would be just for a short period until the 26 . we 've extended it until the 31 .
we 're selling a billion cell phones worldwide this year .
these filters take us from all sound down to what we pay attention to .
many people take refuge in headphones , but they turn big , public spaces like this , shared soundscapes , into millions of tiny , little personal sound bubbles .
second , i call this the mixer .
this is playing with those filters .
i 'd like to begin this song i wrote about ceaseless yearning and never-ending want with a poem of popular petrarchan paradoxes by sir thomas wyatt the elder : " i find no peace , and all my war is done ; i fear and hope , i burn and freeze like ice ; i fly above the wind , and yet i cannot arise ; and naught i have , and all the world i seize upon . "
as they listened to the experts ' voices , the independent decision-making parts of their brains switched off .
so if a radiologist is looking at the scan of a patient with suspected pneumonia , say , what happens is that , if they see evidence of pneumonia on the scan , they literally stop looking at it -- thereby missing the tumor sitting three inches below on the patient 's lungs .
all the research now shows us that this actually makes us smarter .
and in particular , i want to talk about the design of diarrhea .
if instead transmission to another host requires host mobility , then we expect that the winners of the competition will be the milder organisms .
now , this suggests that if you could just block waterborne transmission , you could cause disease organisms to shift from the right-hand side of that graph to the left-hand side of the graph .
one would be to take a lot of different strains of this organism -- some that produce a lot of toxins , some that produce a little -- and take those strains and spew them out in different countries .
and we found that in chile -- within two months of the invasion of peru you had strains entering chile -- and when you look at those strains , in the very far left-hand side of this graph , you see a lot of variation in the toxin production .
so , you 've got a higher level of virulence .
in the case of waterborne transmission , we 'd like to clean up the water supplies , see whether or not we can get those organisms to evolve towards mildness .
and these are the data .
we 're dealing with living systems ; we 're dealing with systems that evolve .
every single thing i planned to say , they have said it here , and it looks and sounds like i have nothing else to say .
it appeals to pity . it appeals to something called charity .
but they also succeed at the job of entrepreneurship .
why ? because we lack the internal , institutional framework and policy framework that can make it possible for us to benefit from our external relations . i 'll give you an example .
to get legitimacy , governments often need to deliver things like primary education , primary health , roads , build hospitals and clinics .
governments are not changing it . why ?
there you go . 70 cabinet ministers , 114 presidential advisers , by the way , who never see the president , except on television .
and this was an amazing year .
and i just finished a couple of months ago .
so they believe you should not just wear helmets for biking , but also for walking around .
but the over-eating and over-drinking , definitely .
so without noise reduction technology , our country would not exist .
and let 's face it , everyone 's trying to move towards whole grains .
that 's what enzymes are doing .
and so we , in the mixing process , have to develop the gluten , we have to activate the leaven or the yeast , and we have to essentially distribute all the ingredients evenly .
three transformations take place in the oven .
in fact , dante says you can 't understand the three deeper levels unless you first understand the literal level , so that 's why we 're talking literally about bread .
so as i said , i think bread is a transformational food .
yeast is eating sugar and turning it into carbon dioxide and alcohol .
or another analogy would be , a caterpillar has been turned into a butterfly .
we 'll start a little piece here , and i 'm going to take a little piece here -- i think i 'd better taste it myself before you have it at lunch .
so here it appears as if it 's the viewer that 's sort of instigating the sense of order among the panels , but it could also be the other way around , that the panels are so stuck within their preconditioned behaviors that they sort of thrust the viewer with the role of a tyrant .
so this is the final fabricated body of the decoy .
so we can 't wait to be engulfed by 996 of them .
he arrives on the small hill , dripping with water .
they define what the system is .
we must understand it .
the age of the ocean , the tectonic plates , gives rise to a totally new phenomenon that we have heard about in this conference .
and the models that we need to predict the future do not have enough data to refine them .
this is what it looks like .
or they can transfer control to someone in india or china who can take over for a while , because it 's all going to be directly connected through the internet .
just as you move , it generates power .
what are the troops ? the troops are the autonomous vehicles , of course .
i want to start my story in germany , in 1877 , with a mathematician named georg cantor .
and that worked for a hundred years .
and as you go through the path , you have to get more and more polite .
i think something 's going on there . "
it is not the same pattern at two different scales .
and with each iteration of that algorithm , you learn the iterations of the myth .
and i measured out the lengths of straw , put it on a log-log plot , got the scaling exponent , and it almost exactly matches the scaling exponent for the relationship between wind speed and height in the wind engineering handbook .
odd plus even gives you odd .
we 've focused in the u.s. on african-american students as well as native american and latino .
so if we want to find a better way of doing that kind of work , we need look only no farther than africa to find these robust self-organizing algorithms .
there is a problem with scuba though , in that it imposes some limitations on how deep you can go , and it turns out that depth is about 200 feet .
and the effect of that pressure is that you have an increased density of gas molecules in every breath you take .
now helium 's a gas , there 're a lot of reasons why helium 's good , it 's a tiny molecule , it 's inert , it doesn 't give you narcosis .
two , they allow you to stay underwater longer .
so we need another gas , something to dilute the oxygen with .
i 'm going to take you on a deep dive .
but this is what it looks like , and this kind of habitat just goes on and on and on for miles .
sharks are actually not very dangerous animals and that 's why we weren 't worried much , why we were joking around down there .
we were at 360 feet .
we 're up to seven new species per hour of time we spend at that depth .
i call it seeking joy -- this pursuit of happiness .
i 'm a writer , and i 've been watching people with the slide shows and scientists and bankers , and i 've been feeling a bit like a gangsta rapper at a bar mitzvah .
if you want to know about africa , read our literature -- and not just " things fall apart , " because that would be like saying , " i 've read ' gone with the wind ' and so i know everything about america . "
and language can 't be understood in its abstraction .
this seemingly innocent joke , when i heard it as a child in nigeria , was told about igbo , yoruba and hausa , with the hausa being harry .
so at 18 , i was bonded off to prison in nigeria .
please stop ! "
have i not myself been imprisoned ?
the fact that it happens in " another country " takes you quite by surprise .
rise and walk away like a panther . "
and he said that there were still times when he wished he could go back and play the organ the way he used to , and that for me , medical school could wait , but that the violin simply would not .
the synchrony of emotions that we experience when we hear an opera by wagner , or a symphony by brahms , or chamber music by beethoven , compels us to remember our shared , common humanity , the deeply communal connected consciousness , the empathic consciousness that neuropsychiatrist iain mcgilchrist says is hard-wired into our brain 's right hemisphere .
where do you go to find out how to make an app ?
i 'm working with a third party company to make an app .
ss : oh , yeah . pm : what was that story ?
and she said , i can do this .
now we have , all over the world , women are called " bossy . " there is a word for " bossy , " for little girls , in every language there 's one .
i mean , let 's just put it out there , face the fact that women are -- in a time when we have more open doors , and more opportunities -- are still not getting to the leadership positions .
what they want in their careers . the kind of partners they want , if at all .
and i think people don 't fully understand how broad the message is .
and i think we are not really being honest about that , for so many reasons . it 's so hard to talk about gender .
the usual suspects , like saturated fat and sugar , nicotine , opiates , cocaine , too much alcohol and chronic stress .
thank you .
one person wrote in , " when i win , i 'm going to buy my own little mountain and have a little house on top . "
and we manipulated how much money we gave them .
in fact , it doesn 't matter how much money you spent .
maybe you have something in mind , maybe not .
these are only two countries .
so we can look and see how well they sell things as a function of being a member of a team .
other teams , we give them money to spend on their dodgeball teammates .
and i come from a long way .
and that made me call myself a war child .
so i hope you 're going to hear this .
guns barking like lightning and thunder .
and why , why when the rest of the children were learning how to read and write , i was learning how to fight .
but i had this question .
i don 't know how they did it .
we have like 40 kids , ex-child soldiers mixed with anybody that we feel like we want to support .
go save a life of a child .
now , i found the answer very quickly .
he was a really keen sailor . and he had this beautiful boat .
and the third , of course , is the globalization of terrorism .
so what is rogue economics ?
so , you see , what is the relationship ?
now , the euro was a newly born currency of great opportunity for business , and , of course , for investment .
this is a construction helmet that i received two years ago at the groundbreaking of the largest project i , and my firm , have ever been involved in .
so , what do we architects need to do ? we need to stitch back creation and execution .
and we don 't understand why they won 't let us in . right ?
so , the first position we took was , " hey , we as architects had better not show up and do a pristine building that doesn 't engender the same freedoms that this old dilapidated shed provided the company . "
so , the building affords artistic directors the freedom to conceive of almost any kind of activity underneath this floating object .
now that , i would say , is architecture performing .
and so this technology already had all the failsafe mechanisms and allowed the theater and our client to actually do this with confidence that they would be able to change over their configurations at will .
but most convincingly when we had to confront the idea of changing costs from architecture to infrastructure , is something that is represented by this .
again , just a couple people are required .
just for malaria itself , there are a million deaths a year , and more than a billion people that need to be tested because they are at risk for different species of malarial infections .
i 'm going to show you some examples here , and we will run through some of them .
so up till now , you didn 't actually see what i would see from one of these setups .
and the optical components , if you look at the inset up on the right , we had to figure out a way to manufacture lenses in paper itself at really high throughputs , so it uses a process of self-assembly and surface tension to build achromatic lenses in the paper itself .
so , the first thing that you might notice about the mapping site is just the fluidity of the zooming and the panning , which , if you 're familiar at all with seadragon , that 's where it comes from .
thank you .
i don 't want to see you guys yet .
i would like to kind of zoom in on the moon .
in the north of uganda , there are something like 1.5 million internally displaced people , people who are not refugees in another country , but because of the civil war , which has been going on for about 20 years , they have nowhere to live .
at that moment , they fired and shot off my fingers .
all the video you have just seen was recorded by human rights groups working with witness .
they 're more rare than the panda bear .
after a while of reading this in the news , it just becomes news .
here 's a mother and her two year-old cub were traveling on a ship a hundred miles offshore in the middle of nowhere , and they 're riding on this big piece of glacier ice , which is great for them ; they 're safe at this point .
losing that ice is like losing the soil in a garden .
supposedly , science is stating that it could be the oldest living animal on earth right now .
oh , and they also happen to eat happy feet .
and this seal is taking this penguin by the head , and it 's flipping it back and forth .
so that 's all i had to work with at that point .
now i 've got four or five penguins floating around my head , and i 'm just sitting there shooting away .
i get emotional . sorry .
the point that we should be worried about is , how much strangeness are we getting ?
he makes an additional indictment of our strong ties when he says that these people who are so close to us , these strong ties in our lives , actually have a homogenizing effect on us .
we have to change the norms .
i actually had a therapist who once said to me , " eve , you 've been coming here for two years , and , to be honest , it never occurred to me that you had a body . "
if i was afraid , i went to more dangerous places .
then i went somewhere else .
before cancer , the world was something other .
and she said , " it 's for you .
it was my mother leaving , just at the moment that i was being born .
so we prowl from house to house looking for flies captured in spider webs and we set them free .
then our neighbor pops her head in , and she turns red with rage when she realizes that those immigrants from downstairs have somehow gotten their hands on her pizza .
thank you .
it doesn 't matter whether you 're a yeast ; it doesn 't matter whether you 're a mouse ; doesn 't matter whether you 're a fly ; we all have dna .
when you 're seeing these pictures , it 's all ones and zeros , and when you 're talking on your telephone , your cell phone , and it 's going over the network , your voice is all being turned into ones and zeros and magically whizzed around .
we have about a hundred , 120,000 others that don 't appear to function every day , but represent this archival history of how we used to work as a species going back tens of thousands of years .
because what nature is doing is double-clicking all the time .
this company , synthetic genomics , i 'm involved with , created the first full synthetic genome for a little bug , a very primitive creature called mycoplasma genitalium .
by the way , just so you know : you get stressed out about genetically modified organisms ; there is not one single vine in this valley or anywhere that is not genetically modified .
we all talk about terroir ; we worship terroir ; we say , wow , is my terroir great ! it 's so special .
now , we can create bad impacts -- we can poison ourselves ; we can poison the earth -- but that 's just a natural outcome of a mistake we made .
this is a dolphin that is self-aware .
and these are real personalities .
and they started to quickly imitate the sounds they were hearing on the keyboard .
sue 's encouraging her to continue a little more .
so we started up this interspecies internet project .
the dolphins are pretty intrigued as to what 's going on here tonight .
it has 3.4 times 10 to the 38th possible terminations .
so we 'll need something like c3po to become a translator between ourselves and some of the other machines we live with .
some people might have looked at the video that you showed and thought , well , that 's just a webcam .
now , similarly , the old story about oil is that if we wanted to save very much of it , it would be expensive , or we would have done it already , because markets are essentially perfect .
maybe a decade , according to my friends in detroit .
in the process , we will gain about a million good jobs , mainly rural .
but then the next generation of planes saves about half .
but if this mclaren were to run into a wall at 65 miles an hour , the entire crash energy would be absorbed by a couple of woven carbon-fiber composite cones , weighing a total of 15 pounds , hidden in the front end .
now , when you go through a similar analysis for every way we use oil , including buildings , industry , feedstocks and so on , you find that of the 28 million barrels a day the government says we will need in 2025 , well , about eight of that can be removed by efficiency by then , with another seven still being saved as the vehicle stocks turn over , at an average cost of only 12 bucks a barrel , instead of 26 for buying the oil .
and for each car so financed , scrap almost one clunker , preferably the dirtiest ones .
and make the transition to more efficient vehicles go faster .
as it went off , i took off and safely got to the other side .
but as i had time to stop and think , i actually started to realize i had a lot to be grateful for .
let me step back and take a look at why the city is so good for the blind .
i was waiting for an audible pedestrian signal , and as it went off , i was just about to step out into the street , when all of a sudden , my right hand was just gripped by this guy , and he yanked my arm and pulled me out into the crosswalk and was dragging me out across the street , speaking to me in mandarin .
disability is an equal-opportunity provider .

" surviving the slammer : do 's and don 'ts . "
and as david lee roth sang in " just a gigolo , " " i ain 't got no body . "
the agony as an act of passion . "
so this subject-object thing , is part of something i 'm very interested in because this is why , frankly , i believe in political correctness .
and so was humor .
i mean he had laid it all out .
my grandmother always acted in other people 's interests , whether they wanted her to or not .
that , and i will say this to the scientists , that the trickster has the ability to hold his ideas lightly so that he can let room in for new ideas or to see the contradictions or the hidden problems with his ideas .
that 's the second of the quadruple .
finding the balance between those things is always dangerous because you might tip off too much in the direction of unprepared .
so i said , " no , i 'm gonna be good , honey , i 'm gonna be good . i am . "
and they say , " we 'll , we 're going to do what we did last year this year . "
i am never using that , right ? "
so who came up with this idea ? who owns it ?
we didn 't know what was happening in those young brains .
i actually like kids .
billions and billions of dollars for data that it 's too late to use .
we can 't stifle innovation in our business .
the fact that you have failure , that shouldn 't stop you from pushing the science forward .
geoffrey canada : well , you know , john , 100 percent of our kids graduated high school last year in my school .
please give it up for him one more time .
so next time you think about a vehicle , i hope , like us , you 're thinking about something new .
i wasn 't trying to be funny .
one is not prime .
but - 1 , - 1 - 1 , are all prime numbers .
and at a gathering of prestigious american mathematicians , he walked to the board , took up a piece of chalk , and started writing out the powers of two : two , four , eight , 16 -- come on , join in with me , you know how it goes -- 32 , 64 , 128 , 256 , 512 , 1,024 , 2,048 .
put simply , in a room full of randomly selected people , i 'm a maths genius .
for the slightly less geeky of you , think about the harry potter novels , okay ?
but for me it 's amazing because it 's a metaphor for the time in which we live , when human minds and machines can conquer together .
no , it wasn 't . the highlight of 2012 , so clearly , was the discovery of the higgs boson .
could we reinvent fire ?
by 2050 though , it could become efficient , connected and distributed with elegantly frugal autos , factories and buildings all relying on a modern , secure and resilient electricity system .
indeed , that sort of vehicle fitness then makes electric propulsion affordable because the batteries or fuel cells also get smaller and lighter and cheaper .
they can save lives because this stuff can absorb up to 12 times as much crash energy per pound as steel .
the trucks could even use natural gas .
and industry can accelerate too , doubling its energy productivity with a 21 percent internal rate of return .
and of course , as you go back upstream , the components get smaller and therefore cheaper .
actually no generator is 24 / 7 . they all break .
traditionally utilities build a lot of giant coal and nuclear plants and a bunch of big gas plants and maybe a little bit of efficiency renewables .
i 've described not just a once-in-a-civilization business opportunity , but one of the most profound transitions in the history of our species .
it was an amazingly smelly city . not just because of the cesspools , but also the sheer number of livestock in the city would shock people .
you can 't really see it in this map , but this is the map that becomes the central focus in the second half of my book .
and the map is actually a little bit bigger .
the whole world was laid out for me .
but then , i was exposed to the most extraordinary knowledge and skills that very poor people have , which are never brought into the mainstream -- which is never identified , respected , applied on a large scale .
you have to have a dignity of labor .
whatever idea you have , come and try it .
i was in a bit of a spot .
unfortunately , they 're almost half german , they 're so precise .
the prime minister is 12 years old .
the attendance must not drop . "
of course , the women were much more intelligent than the men .
comes back , goes into the village , says , " well what 's the story ? "
called the husband , the husband came , swaggering , politician , mobile in his hand . " not possible . "
" first they ignore you , then they laugh at you , then they fight you , and then you win . "
working with minustah , which is the u.n. mission in haiti , with the ministry of public works , with different ngos , we inspected over 1,500 buildings .
this is xantus daniel ; he 's a mason , just a general construction worker , not a foreman , who took one of our trainings .
and basically it 's all evolved to handle its food source , which is dung .
so what i want to share with you now are some of the experiments that myself and my colleagues have used to investigate how dung beetles deal with these problems .
the thing is the sun is not always available to you , because at sunset it disappears below the horizon .
he knows exactly what the problem is , and he knows exactly how to deal with it , and the dance is this transition behavior that allows them to reorientate themselves .
but if we contrast now what happens in a hot environment , look at the temperature of the soil .
there 's one more interesting aspect of this dung beetle 's behavior that we found quite fascinating , and that 's that it forages and provisions a nest .
what we 've got is a burrow . that 's where the forage was .
but i knew that i 'd need superpowers to make my dreams come true .
outside of this room , more than a third of us smile more than 20 times per day , whereas less than 14 percent of us smile less than five .
and think about it this way : 25,000 times 400 -- quite a few kids out there feel like mark zuckerberg every day .
but before you give yourself too much credit , look at this .
and i think that 's why many of the most significant people in effective altruism have been people who have had backgrounds in philosophy or economics or math .
and then , as they got to the age at which many people start to think of retirement , they returned to them , and they 've decided to cut back on their spending , to live modestly , and to give both money and time to helping to fight global poverty .
it costs about 40,000 dollars to train a guide dog and train the recipient so that the guide dog can be an effective help to a blind person .
it 's been something fulfilling to me .
i was pleased to read it . chris went on to say that he 'd been influenced by my writings in what he did .
so the rains come , they go down the rivers , and the flooding happens .
and so we thought perhaps there might be a better way to come up with an alternative cooking fuel .
and more than in haiti , this produces really smoky fires , and this is where you see the health impacts of cooking with cow dung and biomass as a fuel .
that 's an awful lot for a country of haiti -- with a population of eight million and an average income of less than 400 dollars .
they can generate income from this .
the next thing i believe is that we need to create technologies for poor farmers to add value to their own crops .
but i think with the vision to do that , we can move forward .
today , we know that women are 70 percent more likely to experience depression over their lifetimes compared with men .
the first is that there is so much more to learn and we 're not making the investment in fully understanding the extent of these sex differences .
linda 's disease , like the disease of so many women , looks like this .
all three were diagnosed with lung cancer , the number one cancer killer of women in the united states today .
now let 's look at the dollars invested in breast cancer -- these are the dollars invested per death -- and the dollars invested in lung cancer .
or if we analyzed our data by sex .
and while these two cities have the same population , san diego has grown six times larger than tijuana in the last decades , immediately thrusting us to confront the tensions and conflicts between sprawl and density , which are at the center of today 's discussion about environmental sustainability .
so while waste flows southbound , people go north in search of dollars , and most of my research has had to do with the impact of immigration in the alteration of the homogeneity of many neighborhoods in the united states , particularly in san diego .
they had to talk to their friends in seattle who had gone through the same experience .
kids should not have to grow up and look at things like this .
he came to my class and we built an indoor edible wall .
okay , i 'm going to tell you what it does .
and when the bronx borough president shows up and the state senator comes to our class , believe you me , the bronx can change attitudes now .
the greenest class in new york city .
the poorest congressional district in america , the most migratory community in america , we can do this .
where does it go ? zero miles to plate , right down into the cafeteria .
i grow seven kinds of mint in my class .
let them cook . great lunch today , let them do culinary things .
in 1978 , i was working for time magazine , and i was given a three-day assignment to photograph amerasian children , children who had been fathered by american gis all over southeast asia , and then abandoned -- 40,000 children all over asia .
so there i was , i couldn 't speak a word of korean , and this is the first night i met hyun-sook .
again , not at all shy or withdrawn , or anything like the other children that i 'd photographed .
and the translator said , " the grandmother says that she thinks she 's dying , and she wants to know if you would take hyun-sook to america with you . "
i figured i 'd come back in a couple of weeks and talk to the grandmother .
and she said , " he says he knows who you are , what do you want ? "
and i said to them , " look , there 's a little girl who has a tiny chance of getting out of here and going to america . "
and they actually take items of clothing and photographs , and they burn them as part of the ritual .
and there 's clothes , and there 's kids , and , you know , there 's three adults and 75 kids -- you can imagine .
the uncle went back to his family , and natasha and tim and gene and i went out to dinner .
so , sure enough , it 's one o 'clock , room 's freezing , i go to close the window , and i hear people shouting outside , and i thought , " oh , the bars must have just gotten out . "
please , i just want to wake up , it 's got to be a nightmare . "
i didn 't know who it was , i didn 't know what they wanted , and natasha could tell they were firemen trying to get us out .
this is saying goodbye to everybody at the orphanage .
this is her cooking teacher .
this is her first trip back to korea , so there 's her uncle .
some say bigger .
and sharks used to come into the bay .
now i don 't pretend to have any irish , but in kerry they were often known as " ainmhide na seolta , " the monster with the sails .
and we try to guess what they 're doing from their behavior on the surface .
a satellite tag only works when the air is clear of the water and can send a signal to the satellite .
now i 'm not a geneticist , so i 'm not going to pretend to understand the genetics .
so even though basking sharks are found throughout the world , you couldn 't tell the difference genetically from one from the pacific , the atlantic , new zealand , or from ireland , south africa .
they didn 't get enough samples to really explore the genetics in enough detail .
and we would use conventional methods -- i have a crossbow , you see the crossbow in my hand there , which we use to sample whales and dolphins for genetic studies as well .
so we thought , okay , we 're going to try to get out and get some slime .
and what you 're trying to look at is the males have claspers , which kind of dangle out behind the back of the shark .
but we at harvard were wondering if this was really true .
el let me tell you a little bit about where books come from .
so , although that would be really , really awesome , again , that 's extremely , extremely impractical .
and you also knew , more or less , that if you were to go back in time 200 years and ask the following statesman with equally fabulous hair , " tom , what should i say ? "
people were walking around obsessed .
if you do that , you might think , " oh great . i 'm going to do my best work when i 'm in my 20s . "
this is distribution as seen in germany -- very different , it 's shifted to the left .
but it turns out in the 18th century , people didn 't really care about that at all .
these all happen to be on our computers , on computers across the world .
to the contrary , we knew that this project would destroy the environment : it would destroy riparian forests , which were the basis for the survival of nomadic groups , the samburu and the turkana in this area .
and this is the phenomenon which i call failing governance , because when i then came to germany and started this little ngo here in berlin , at the villa borsig , we were told , " you cannot stop our german exporters from bribing , because we will lose our contracts .
and so there are still a lot of people who are not convinced that you have to stop bribing .
i see my time is ticking .
and then i was an entertainer , i guess .
these are a -- this is like a 15 million dollar line .
they said , " don 't talk to us about play-doh . "
but the -- this is a guy named dr. yatz , who would take toys apart and show kids about engineering .
and actually , this is , to me , how i can come up with great ideas .
oh , this is a little pony , little pony -- very cute little thing .
well , i came up with this kind of linear expression thing with these cams and feedback . and that worked pretty well .
she 's an actual , you know , artist .
and so dave and i got working .
i -- it 's unbelievable how -- i don 't know how that can be .
and so we actually went in .
and the thing about blending science and art in this multidisciplinary stuff is you can do a robot , and then you go back and do the shape , and then you go back and forth .
all right -- -- no , it 's very painful , so -- -- these are little pleos and you can probably see them .
and we 're hoping that -- you know , our belief is that humans need to feel empathy towards things in order to be more human .
i don 't know what i 'm missing to say , but as a last thing , i 'd like to say is that if we continue along this path , we are designing our children 's best friends .
the deforestation , especially for oil palm , to provide biofuel for western countries is what 's causing these problems .
still , four years later we have created jobs for about 3,000 people .
you formulate a recipe based upon the factors you can control , whether it be the skills or the fertilizer or the plant choice .
march .
and you can create so much energy from this -- they produce three times more energy per hectare per year , because you can tap them on a daily basis .
it 's only a small part of the area .
cloud cover -- i 'm going to show it to you -- is up .
if you look at rainfall , it was already up 20 percent at that time .
and they can start producing from the trees as many as they like .
in fact , i 'm leaving .
thank you . that was it , by the way .
and the second boy said , " i bring you myrrh . "
" must try harder . " being sent to bed by his dad , you know , to shakespeare , " go to bed , now , " to william shakespeare , " and put the pencil down .
we all have bodies , don 't we ? did i miss a meeting ?
so the hierarchy is rooted on two ideas .
secondly , intelligence is dynamic .
people weren 't aware they could have that .
we have to be careful now that we use this gift wisely and that we avert some of the scenarios that we 've talked about . and the only way we 'll do it is by seeing our creative capacities for the richness they are and seeing our children for the hope that they are . and our task is to educate their whole being , so they can face this future .
it actually has a level of dexterity in its penis much akin to what we have with our hands .
and quite frankly , that 's exactly what it is .
we 've seen a coercion strategy in which sexual structures are used in a forceful way to basically make a female have sex .
it 's kind of a well-kept secret .
so when you compare them to the bonobo , the bonobo is a little hairier .
canopied trees as tall as 40 meters , 130 feet , grow densely in the area .
you can get it out .
ss : she 's got the pedals down , but not the wheel .
kanzi 's rock is from gona , ethiopia and is identical to that used by our african ancestors two-and-a-half million years ago .
compare the chalk writing with the lexigram on the keyboard .
panbanisha is enjoying playing her harmonica , until nyota , now one year old , steals it .
ss : so we have a bi-species environment , we call it a " panhomoculture . "
the reason for that is that these characters are actually not real characters .
that stick figure is physically stimulated . you can see it here on the screen .
we did get it to work eventually , after tweaking a bit here and there .
so we started the company .
but what you 'll see is -- it 's going to receive a push now from the left .
we just did that for a laugh , just to see what happens .
so this character is going to be hit by a force , it 's going to realize it 's in the air , and it 's going to try and , well , stick out its arm in the direction where it 's landing .
now , i 'm showing this to you just to show you how organic it actually can feel , how realistic it can look .
for the first time , you 'll have actors that really feel very interactive , that have real bodies that really react .
so , you kick the guy and the guy 's supposed to counter-balance .
for a week , we slept under our beds because we were worried that bullets might fly through the window .
the first is it made me fall in love with africa .
you might get impeached for that .
now these leaders are by no means perfect , but the one thing they have done is that they have cleaned up much of the mess of generation two .
erick comes from the island of madagascar .
but we couldn 't satisfy it .
i 've been filming time-lapse flowers 24 hours a day , seven days a week , for over 35 years .
and chip taylor , our monarch butterfly expert , he replied , " nothing lasts forever .
and if you 're a benchwarmer , you might be a virgin or somebody who for whatever reason isn 't in the game , maybe because of your age or because of your ability or because of your skillset .
can you imagine saying to your coach , " uh , i 'm not really feeling it today , i think i 'll sit this game out . "
you talk about what you want .
and none of them are wrong . they 're different .
and who gets to answer those questions ?
and all of those products probably end their lives in a dump like this one in manila .
but take the example of heparin .
we don 't have a system to ensure that human rights , basic dignity , are ensured .
they don 't own those facilities .
now , getting there is not easy .
go to the website . look at the audit results .
" you want me to deliver human rights throughout my global supply chain .
that 's my simple proposition to you , my simple plea to every decision-maker in this room , everybody out there .
i don 't want to answer these now . i 'll come on to them at the end .
that was our hf radio antenna .
the lesson is : don 't even try . "
and i don 't know if words will ever quite do that moment justice .
it was a lack of ice -- open water .
you can 't see an awful lot . you can just see , there 's a yellow ribbon tied to one of my ski poles .
it 's a special feeling .
i was bawling my eyes out by the time the plane landed -- a pretty emotional moment .
this is probably why i didn 't get into trouble about the length of my airstrip .
they got to the pole late january 1912 to find a norwegian flag already there .
my english lost , i wanted to vomit .
it was the future i couldn 't accept .
i had never seen an airplane before .
it 's just like this one , completely worthless , in which it allegedly worked by " electrostatic magnetic ion attraction , " which translates to " pseudoscientific baloney " -- would be the nice word -- in which you string together a bunch of words that sound good , but it does absolutely nothing .
i call this process " patternicity " -- that is , the tendency to find meaningful patterns in both meaningful and meaningless noise .
so the default position is just : believe all patterns are real -- all rustles in the grass are dangerous predators and not just the wind .
just shout out anything you see .
our right hemisphere appears to be where a lot of this patternicity occurs .
if you 're too skeptical , you 'll miss the really interesting good ideas .
and you see the lamp here , i know .
yet again , your pattern detection devices are fooled .
well , the wind is inanimate ; the dangerous predator is an intentional agent .
some conspiracies really are true .
it 's just a minute and a half .
girl : no .
it 's the place where we can see and touch and hear and feel climate change in action .
initially , i was working on a national geographic assignment -- conventional , single frame , still photography .
we just had 33 cameras shoot about half an hour ago all across the northern hemisphere , watching what 's happened .
but 280 is the peak .
here 's what columbia 's done . this is in south central alaska .
this camera was shooting every hour .
you can see it deflating .
it 's flowing out to the atlantic ocean on the left .
the policy and the economics and the technology are serious enough issues , but we actually can deal with them .
and you can kind of think of this as a pyramid of this bubbling up of viruses from animals into human populations .
deep in a remote region of cameroon , two hunters stalk their prey .
i 'm going to be talking about this .
this is challenging work to do .
early on , in order to ship our specimens , we had to have dry ice . to get dry ice we had to go to the breweries -- beg , borrow , steal to get these folks to give it to us .
but really , this is just the beginning from our perspective .
it was never popular with many political leaders , especially those in the united states who somehow thought that new media would be able to do what missiles couldn 't .
well my theory is that it 's happening because censorship actually is less effective than you think it is in many of those places .
we tend to think that somehow this is going to harm these dictatorships , but in many cases it only strengthens them .
they may have become slower , but the activists could still access it and actually argue that having access to them is actually great for many authoritarian states .
well i say we have to stop thinking about the number of ipods per capita and start thinking about ways in which we can empower intellectuals , dissidents , ngos and then the members of civil society .
so you 'd just see her feet .
well it looked like a little shanty shed when i 'd finished .
the gentleman who commissioned me to do this was a gentleman called peter huf .
i found these little bits of glass .
then i used fibers out of my jumper , which i held and stretched .
audience : no .
even though they get on our nerves , i would never kill an insect because , " all creatures great and small " -- there is a hymn that says that .
so say if you cut a period stop in half , a full stop , that 's about the size of the whole thing .
it must be a machine . "
so most of my work , i don 't use glue .
it 's very painstaking work , but the best things come in small packages .
these fossils were deposited in a river system .
it 's a dinosaur like no other .
and of course , the government official said , " of course you have to have a handrail . "
so it means basically this architecture is a roof .
we can go skiing in -20 degrees in winter .
the building is only five meters tall with seven floors .
and these children have the highest athletic abilities among many kindergartens .
this is really interesting , i myself have a story in brazil that people think is an overnight success .
when you 're growing towards a peak , you need to work harder than ever and find yourself another peak .
once i saw an ad , and it was a lot of friends , they were going up a mountain , it was a very high mountain , and it was a lot of work .
thank you .
we didn 't have a way of preparing people .
ebola does not spread through the air .
and we need preparedness .
there are some big breakthroughs , like the adeno-associated virus , that could work very , very quickly .
in sunday school , they taught me don 't confront , don 't argue , even if you 're right , turn the other cheek .
ten months later , i quit my job . i said i could not stand it anymore .
we have delivered live pigs to kenya 's parliament as a symbol of our politicians ' greed .
can i say one more thing ?
so if china does become the world 's largest economy , think about this : it 'll be the first time since this guy was on the throne of england -- george iii , not a good friend of napoleon 's -- that in the world we will have as the largest economy a non-english speaking country , a non-western country , a non-liberal democratic country .
here 's the second reason .

to send money within africa , the cost is even higher : over 20 percent .
most of the governments in the world have allowed their post offices to have exclusive partnerships with money transfer companies .
i visited a camp for workers .
or four percent interest rate , and then say that the money would be used for building schools , roads , airports , train systems in the country of origin , a lot of migrants would be interested in parting with their money because it 's not only financial gains that give them an opportunity to stay engaged with their country 's development .

but , can you really blame us for not jumping at the opportunity of going to the middle of the city in the middle of a working day to attend , physically , a public hearing that has no impact whatsoever ?
two years ago , with a group of friends from argentina , we started thinking , " how can we get our representatives , our elected representatives , to represent us ? "
and i must be honest : i think , in hindsight , we were .
but in our experience , we actually stand a chance of making it work .
so this is the share of total income going to the top 10 percent .
so let me come to some of the explanations and speculations about the future .
and this was in a way very obvious to everybody for a simple reason , which is that growth was close to zero percent during most of the history of mankind .
so right now , the most capital-intensive sectors in the economy are the real estate sector , housing , the energy sector , but it could be in the future that we have a lot more robots in a number of sectors and that this would be a bigger share of the total capital stock that it is today .
in the current political context , how realistic are those ?
so we don 't want to return to that kind of extreme , pre-world war i inequality .
recently , i flew over a crowd of thousands of people in brazil playing music by george frideric handel .
vital human expressions .
it 's called prosopagnosia , and it results from damage to a particular part of the brain .
we wanted to know if there was a special part of the brain for recognizing faces , and there was already reason to think there might be such a thing based on this phenomenon of prosopagnosia that i described a moment ago , but nobody had ever seen that part of the brain in a normal person , so we set out to look for it .
no , we haven 't .
you almost looked like somebody i 'd seen before , but somebody different .
in contrast , that same region does not respond strongly when you hear perfectly familiar sounds that don 't have a clear pitch , like these .
but then he devised the critical test : he showed subjects images of food like this and compared them to images with very similar color and shape , but that weren 't food , like these .
with diffusion imaging , you can trace bundles of neurons that connect to different parts of the brain , and with this method shown here , you can trace the connections of individual neurons in the brain , potentially someday giving us a wiring diagram of the entire human brain .
what would happen when these cuban doctors left ?
big problems need big solutions , sparked by big ideas , imagination and audacity , but also solutions that work .
academically , elam is tough , but 80 percent of its students graduate .
people buried under 30 million tons of rubble .
not only have i seen it work , i 've done the work . "
i don 't understand why i 'm being passed over . "
and then they pretty much stopped .
one is because of the positions they 're guided into , and the other is because of informal mentoring and sponsorship .
it 's important for h.r. executives to make sure that the missing 33 percent is appropriately emphasized , and it 's important for women and men who are in management positions to examine the mindsets we hold about women and men , about careers and success , to make sure we are creating a level playing field for everybody .
it 's going to get into your drinking water , into your food , into your immediate surroundings .
and is this really the solution ?
we need to make it more robust , and we 're going to do more testing in malawi and south africa this coming year .
this is beijing then , not a single high rise building in beijing or shanghai .
there are gardens and open spaces for the community , almost every unit with its own private garden , and community space all around .
photo agencies in gaza refused to train me because of my gender .
but to show the full frame of unseen stories of gazans .
more data allows us to see new .
and what we can do is we can reuse this information for uses that we never even imagined when we first collected the data .
maybe , if we aggregated the data , maybe we could identify telltale signs that best predict that a car accident is going to take place in the next five seconds .
he plays the computer . he wins .
now , it 's a term called predictive policing , or algorithmic criminology , and the idea is that if we take a lot of data , for example where past crimes have been , we know where to send the patrols .
we have to be the master of this technology , not its servant .
when i was there last in the spring , there was an advisory for people of my age — over 65 — to stay indoors and not move much .
over the next two decades , we 'll see the demand for energy rise by 40 percent , and the growth in the economy and in the population is putting increasing pressure on our land , on our water and on our forests .
i 've already described the problems of beijing : pollution , congestion , waste and so on .
we 've seen more : in london , we 've introduced the congestion charge , actually quite quickly and effectively , and we 've seen great improvements in the bus system , and cleaned up the bus system .
look at land , land and particularly forests .
and there 's much more coming .
you might think it was not fair that i 've been lined up to speak after these first two talks to speak about science .
i 'll try to use an approach that 's slightly materialistic , but it also attempts to convey that , in nature , there is extraordinary philosophy and harmony .
but we have something that plays the same role , with much more elegance though : the trees , our good old friends that , like geysers , can transfer an enormous amount of water from the ground into the atmosphere .
related to this subject , we are going to talk about what i call the paradox of chance , which is curious .
here it is , pulsing .
when humid air , high humidity and radiation are combined with these organic compounds , which i call exogenous vitamin c , generous vitamin c in the form of gas , the plants release antioxidants which react with pollutants .
it 's not a common little river that flows into a canal .
i 'd like to tell you a short story .
and let 's make it look down here , rather than to the far reaches of the universe .
so , you can figure out why they called it the green inferno .
in nature , all that is organized in extraordinary structures has a function .
it was printed in 1983 by chuck hull , who invented 3d printing .
millions of in-the-ear hearing aids are already 3d printed today .
i think that it 's the opportunity to put tomorrow 's technology in the hands of youngsters that will create endless abundance of job opportunities , and with that , everybody can become an expert maker and an expert manufacturer .
but as we enter this era of big data , what we 're beginning to find is there 's a difference between more data being just better and more data being different , capable of changing the questions we want to ask , and this difference is not about how much data we collect , it 's whether those data open new windows into our universe , whether they change the way we view the sky .
our sky is in constant motion .
so studying the asteroids is like performing forensics , performing forensics on our solar system , but to do this , we need distance , and we get the distance from the motion , and we get the motion because of our access to time .
and it took three years to find just 42 supernovae , because a supernova only explodes once every hundred years within a galaxy .
in its first night of operation , it will find 10 times the number of supernovae used in the discovery of dark energy .
so how long did women 30 years old in the world go to school : seven years , five years or three years ?
that 's you .
they still are confined to terrible , terrible limitations , but schooling is there in the world today .
the percent in poverty has decreased .
do we have any ideas ?
unusual events are more interesting , no ?
and then we poll the public and see where they score worst .
you heard it . you thought it yourself .
so as soon as i see a question about things i 'm afraid of , which might be earthquakes , other religions , maybe i 'm afraid of terrorists or sharks , anything that makes me feel , assume you 're going to exaggerate the problem .
but this has changed , okay ?
my dream is to build the world 's first underground park in new york city .
now , this photo doesn 't really do it justice .
notice how crowded the neighborhood still feels and how there 's really a lack of green space .
i was so moved by these results that i wanted to make these forests with the same acumen with which we make cars or write software or do any mainstream business , so i founded a company which is an end-to-end service provider to create these native natural forests .
this methodology , i believe , has a potential .
but attitude , aging is also attitude and health .
it 's great to let go .
she says that there is nothing more sensual than a hot shower , that every drop of water is a blessing to the senses .
i have chosen to stay passionate , engaged with an open heart .
at 17 , a boy from my high school detailing all the sexually aggressive things he could do to me because i didn 't pay attention to him .
i was angry and i was frustrated , but most of all , i felt utterly , completely helpless .
in cubbon park , which is a big park in bangalore , i gathered with over 100 others when groups of young men came forward to wear skirts to prove that clothing does not invite rape .
she said she was stalked , groped , and masturbated at .
so after a lot of thought , i recorded a video blog in response , and i told michaela , well , there are different sides to india , and i also tried to explain on air with her , and for the first time , i reached out to this girl who i had never met , who was so far away , but yet i felt so close to .
both the maize and the vegetables are grown on most kenyan farms , which means that most families can feed themselves from their own farm .
so instead , we rely on technology and data .
for credit , a farmer needs to earn the trust of a bank , and if it succeeds , the bank will advance him money .
they said , " wow , that 's great , but that 'll be late .
we fret too much about minor hazards — improbable air crashes , carcinogens in food , low radiation doses , and so forth — but we and our political masters are in denial about catastrophic scenarios .
well luckily , reassurance could be offered .
and i 'd like to finish with a quote from a great scientist called peter medawar .
there are always remnants of the perished ones that are more durable than their fragile bodies and our selective and fading memory of them .
he was a bernese mountain dog , and my ex-husband and i adopted him , and about six months in , we realized that he was a mess .
it 's actually a pretty recent phenomenon that we feel that we have to talk to someone to understand their emotional distress .
other super common behaviors that you may see , particularly in captive animals , are pacing stereotypies or swaying stereotypies , and actually , humans do this too , and in us , we 'll sway , we 'll move from side to side .
and i said , " well , why ? tell me a little bit about it . "
this is extremely anthropomorphic , onto non-human animals or things .
others , like one bonobo who lives in milwaukee at the zoo there was on them until he started to save his paxil prescription and then distribute it among the other bonobos . more than psychopharmaceuticals , though , that veterinary medicine can teach something to human medicine , which is , if you take your dog , who is , say , compulsively chasing his tail , into the veterinary behaviorist , their first action isn 't to reach for the prescription pad ; it 's to ask you about your dog 's life .
the best thing that we could do for our loved ones is , perhaps , to anthropomorphize them .
and two years after this photo was taken , she passed away , and i attended her wake , and nothing could have prepared me for what i saw there , because next to her casket was this painting , and her husband told me it meant so much to her that i had acknowledged her hard work , i had validated what she did .
a thank you can change a life .
we were actually very lucky , and many of those goals happened like , you can see here in the rcif plaza .
a lot of persuasion , a lot of wonderful collaboration with other people , and bit by bit , it worked .
so in fact , something we realized , we can 't just use the web , we have to worry about what the underlying infrastructure of the whole thing , is it in fact of a quality that we need ?
you can go to webat25.org and find some links .
but one year , i gave up speaking .
so this year , instead of giving something up , i will live every day as if there were a microphone tucked under my tongue , a stage on the underside of my inhibition .
period . end of story .
there are some millennials , for instance , who think the whole business is just sordid .
take an inventory of all the forms of power that are at play in your city 's situation : money , of course , people , yes , ideas , information , misinformation , the threat of force , the force of norms .
this is emergent .
so share what you write , do you what you write , and then share what you do .
today i want to talk about changing the way we think about corrections .
take hundreds of volatile people and lock them up , and what you get is chaos .
i was patient with them , explaining our brute force approach to making prisons safer .
inmates and staff started interacting more often and openly and developing a rapport .
at the same time , we found ways to make our operation more efficient through the addition of solar power , rainwater catchment , organic gardening , recycling .
but then we started to realize that if any inmates needed programming , it was these particular inmates .
our strategy is not massive system change .
that we sold to microsoft for 6.4 billion dollars .
the problem is that inequality is at historic highs today and it 's getting worse every day .
middle-out economics rejects the neoclassical economic idea that economies are efficient , linear , mechanistic , that they tend towards equilibrium and fairness , and instead embraces the 21st-century idea that economies are complex , adaptive , ecosystemic , that they tend away from equilibrium and toward inequality , that they 're not efficient at all but are effective if well managed .
there 's nothing to be done , my plutocrat friends might say .
so too for technology workers and financial services workers , who earn multiples of the median wage and yet we employ more and more of them , so clearly you can raise the price of employment and get more of it .
the most insidious thing about trickle-down economics is not the claim that if the rich get richer , everyone is better off .
today , we have trickle-down economics .
show me the data !
undaunted , i try a different angle .
here 's a standard chart of a woman 's waking body temperature during the course of a cycle .
and in fact , we had a second temperature shift , confirmed with a pregnancy test that were indeed pregnant with our first child , very exciting .
you could take your blood pressure , you could take your weight — yeah , who 's excited about taking their weight every day ? early on in our marriage , donald had a stuffy nose and he had been taking a slew of medications to try to relieve his stuffy nose , to no avail .
but okay , what was donald doing just before ?
you don 't have to have a medical degree to be your body 's expert .
i know that other people in the world have far worse things to deal with , but for me , language and music are inextricably linked through this one thing .
if i 'm going to use the word " wednesday " in a sentence , and i 'm coming up to the word , and i can feel that i 'm going to stutter or something , i can change the word to " tomorrow , " or " the day after tuesday , " or something else .
and that 's why i 'm here today .
now , unfortunately , there 's no school that offers the course designing for humanity 101 .
facebook has had a tool for a long time that allowed people to report photos that may be in violation of our community standards , things like spam and abuse .
so i find this hypothetical photo of myself , and it 's not spam , it 's not abuse , but i really wish it weren 't on the site .
now , years ago , when i was working at youtube , we were looking for ways to encourage more people to rate videos , and it was interesting because when we looked into the data , we found that almost everyone was exclusively using the highest five-star rating , a handful of people were using the lowest one-star , and virtually no one was using two , three or four stars .
designing for low-end cell phones is not glamorous design work , but if you want to design for the whole world , you have to design for where people are , and not where you are .
okay .
have you ever had a conversation with yourself and then suddenly realized you 're a real asshole to yourself ?
i 'm an artist who 's worked for many years with biology , with scientific processes , so living material is not uncommon for me .
quite clever .
world over , teams of researchers are decoding its biological principles to understand its computational rules and applying that learning to the fields of electronics , programming and robotics .
everybody takes home a new pet and is invited to post their results on the slime mould collective .
we didn 't just give them oats .
in these early installations , i would take plastic sheets , plastic bags , and things i would find in the hardware store or around the house .
i love science and biology .
but every so often the music gets turned down , everyone stops talking , and stares at exactly the same thing .
and i said , " excuse me ? " and then i looked it up and they do drill into people 's brains .
let 's go back to drilling through a wall .
this is about 2,000 frames a second , and i 'd like you to notice the tip that 's right there on the bottom , about to puncture through tissue .
he said , " do you have any questions ? " and i said , " just one , doc .
but back then , i noticed an intersection between puzzles and illusion .
okay .
gwen , after you .
big scribbles .
why don 't you open it up and remove the one piece of paper from inside and hand it to me , and we will see if it matches your choices .
who 's read " don quixote ? " but wait , but wait , wait , wait , wait , there 's more .
we 've all made order out of chaos .
so remember before the internet ? i call this b.i. okay ?
thank you .
so manufacturing , the cost of innovation , the cost of prototyping , distribution , manufacturing , hardware , is getting so low that innovation is being pushed to the edges and students and startups are being able to build it .
one of my favorite principles is the power of pull , which is the idea of pulling resources from the network as you need them and controlling everything .

and my favorite example of this is a question that came from the audience in a republican debate prior to the last election .
and what started his career is an insight that the way most people were thinking about the holocaust was wrong .
we see it in political clashes within groups with different ideologies .
so if you are a liberal parent and you want to encourage your children to believe in the merits of nontraditional families , you might give them a book like this . [ " heather has two mommies " ] if you are conservative and have a different attitude , you might give them a book like this .
so adam smith starts by asking you to imagine the death of thousands of people , and imagine that the thousands of people are in a country you are not familiar with .
a constitution is something which was set up in the past that applies now in the present , and what it says is , no matter how much we might to reelect a popular president for a third term , no matter how much white americans might choose to feel that they want to reinstate the institution of slavery , we can 't .
now , as exciting as that sounds , when i first started doing cyber — — when i first started doing cyber , i wasn 't sure that sifting through ones and zeros because in my mind , cyber was keeping viruses off of my grandma 's computer , and maybe , maybe on my most glorious day , those are important things , but after 30 minutes of work as a defense contractor , i soon found out that my idea of cyber was a little bit off .
now , it used to be the only way we had to stop this terrorist was with a hail of bullets and a car chase , but that 's not necessarily true anymore .
when i have to do that , what i have to do of this binary information , try to decipher each piece , and see if it might be so after a while , i thought i had found the piece i was looking for .
well i thought , when you 're looking at information at this level , it 's easy to not see the forest through the trees .
this is what your contacts list would look like it 's really hard to analyze this at this level , that i would be trying to find , to a visual representation , translate those relationships , this is what we get .
this is what the code on your phone looks like , but this is what the code on your computer looks like .
i follow these strands of similarity like a trail of bread crumbs to find exactly what i 'm looking for .
it 's the most powerful sound in the world , probably .
it 's not spreading sunshine and lightness in the world .
i 'm not talking about the stuff that falls from the sky and hits you on the head .
i 'd like to have a little rummage in there with you now and just pull a few tools out that you might like to take away and play with , which will increase the power of your speaking .
people who speak all on one note are really quite hard to listen to if they don 't have any prosody at all .
it might be proposing marriage , asking for a raise , a wedding speech .
now let me just put this in context to close .
and i said , " well , you know what ?
so if you have to , write your passwords down , but don 't reuse them .
so a dumb attacker will try every password in order .
so this was pretty fun .
so you can get a pass phrase like " plan builds sure power " or " end determines red drug . "
we got some interesting results , and those of you tepper students in the back will be very interested in this .
" iloveyou " appears many times in many different languages .
but things went dramatically wrong when my parents separated and eventually divorced .
i looked at a couple of letters before i looked at the letter that had my son 's squiggly handwriting on it .
the final thing was writing .
and so i tap back , " fu . " and then he texts back , and he asks me why was i cussing him out .
so what i 'm asking today is that you envision a world where men and women aren 't held hostage to their pasts , where misdeeds and mistakes don 't define you for the rest of your life .
the jingling of my tags drove me mad .
we shouldn 't think that all hard choices are big .
it 's a mistake to think that in hard choices , one alternative really is better than the other , but we 're too stupid to know which , and since we don 't know which , we might as well take the least risky option .
that 's not the case with options in hard choices .
the stuff of the one world can be quantified by real numbers .
we can put our very selves behind an option .
so the lesson of hard choices : reflect on what you can put your agency behind , on what you can be for , and through hard choices , become that person .
before i go any further , let me clarify my role in all of this .
they have to gamble , because they want to appear cutting edge and catch the words that are going to make it , such as lol , but they don 't want to appear faddish and include the words that aren 't going to make it , and i think a word that they 're watching right now is yolo , you only live once .
are you bothered by language fads and language change , or do you find it fun , interesting , something worthy of study as part of a living language ?
american heritage has that as the first definition .
about once a year , i get a ballot that asks me about whether new uses , new pronunciations , new meanings , are acceptable .
i hope you can enjoy being part of the creativity that is continually remaking our language and keeping it robust .
i got stuck and i made it through .
and that 's why i teach my students a more realistic schema .
it 's dead , and everybody feels frustrated .
i 'll try to make my lab as creative as possible , and if everybody else does the same , science will eventually become more and more better and better .
so everybody starts laughing , starts breathing , notices that there 's other scientists around them with shared issues , and we start talking about the emotional and subjective things that go on in research .
including members of congress .
it 's time we strike a new note .
she portrayed acid burn in the ' 95 film " hackers . "
here 's what you should do to fix it .
their moment of transformation was in early 2008 when the church of scientology attempted to remove certain leaked videos from appearing on certain websites .
this worked .
" in this room right here , " he said , " is the talent our nation needs . "
this was largely due to an incorrect poll that said that blacks had voted for the measure by something like 70 percent .
and i call this strategy the " i 'm tired of your foot on my neck " strategy .
the name speaks for itself .

y 'all want to do that ?
we are your mothers and brothers and sisters and sons .
they can run upside down very rapidly on rods , branches and wires , and if you perturb one of those branches , they can perform gymnastic maneuvers like no robot we have yet .
you see these plates , and you see the compliant membrane .
rather than the fixed behaviors that non-mammalian animals have , it could invent new behaviors .
fifty years ago , i wrote a paper describing how i thought the brain worked , and i described it as a series of modules .
each is more abstract than the next one , so the next one might say " capital a. "
it got this query correct : " a long , tiresome speech delivered by a frothy pie topping , " and it quickly responded , " what is a meringue harangue ? "
and remember what happens the last time we expanded our neocortex ?
i had other dreams , not necessarily practical ones , but at the age of eight , i was bequeathed a guitar .
he 's the foreman of the shipyard .
she acknowledges me . she waves , and she smiles .
that moment changed my life .
that 's not what we 're looking for .
and in some ways , think of it as a decoder ring , a sort of resilience decoder ring that we 're going to try to build .
maybe we could take two , three percent of the project on , and see if it was there .
as a little girl , i always imagined i would one day run away .
who here knows that in many cities across the united states it is now illegal to sit on the sidewalk , to wrap oneself in a blanket , to sleep in your own car , to offer food to a stranger ?
for us , in retrospect , it feels like an obvious fit , because bears are so cute and cuddly , and who wouldn 't want to give one to their kids to play with , but the truth is that in 1902 , bears weren 't cute and cuddly .
in a commercial for purina . americans consider lobsters more important than pigeons but also much , much stupider .
this one came from a kid named fritz , and he 's actually got a solution to climate change .

"
we monitor pygmy rabbits with drones .
we have to answer that question , because if we don 't , it 'll be impossible to bring soldiers back to a place in society where they belong , and i think it 'll also be impossible to stop war , if we don 't understand how that mechanism works .
there was no way to bathe .
let 's think about what happens in your brain when you 're in combat .
at restrepo , every guy up there was almost killed , including me , including my good friend tim hetherington , who was later killed in libya .
he came back to the states . he got out of the army .
in effect , you 're saying , " i love these other people more than i love myself . "
compared to that , war , psychologically , in some ways , is easy , compared to that kind of alienation .
i had to disagree with her wholeheartedly when i first showed up there , because literally in the first four days , i had already run away five times from this school .
i remember when we first , right after 9 / 11 , three weeks after 9 / 11 , i was on a plane heading overseas , but i wasn 't heading overseas with the military , i was heading overseas because i got a scholarship to go overseas .

and the only questions i got from people was , " did you shoot anybody ? "
and now she uses her voice as a congresswoman from illinois to fight and advocate for a collection of issues to include veterans issues .
i survived that childhood through a mix of avoidance and endurance .
all of us with stigmatized identities face this question daily : how much to accommodate society by constraining ourselves , and how much to break the limits of what constitutes a valid life ?
in 1988 , i went to moscow to interview artists of the soviet underground , and i expected their work to be dissident and political .
people extol a difference only because it 's theirs .
in 2007 , six years after we met , my partner and i decided to get married .
i 'm glad we all get cake .
the hour for those past thirty ... "
it was totally contrived just for that room , just for that moment .
ronnie : not at four o 'clock in the morning .

what benoist schaal and his team developed was a simple test to investigate what the effect of this secretion might be , in effect , a simple bioassay .
so do go forward and do search for more .
and that 's a hint as to how we discovered this recipe , because we discovered it through an autopsy process .
and we happened to be the regional regulators for it .
in other words , both forms of fraud became absolutely endemic and normal , and this is what drove the bubble .
it 's the greatest success against elite white collar criminals ever , and it was because of this understanding of control fraud and the accounting control fraud mechanism .
so we have to first get rid of the systemically dangerous institutions .
ken robinson : good morning . how are you ?
kirby ferguson and jt : the remix : it is new music created from old music .
in a nutshell , that 's what i was trying to do with these things , but more importantly , that 's what the past 30 years of music has been .

now , google 's pretty secretive about their operations , so no one really knows how much data google has , and in fact , no one really knows how many data centers google has , except people at google itself .
and this is a lot of fun .
so i go and get it , open it up , and it 's punch cards . google-branded punch cards .
it was science fiction made true , robotic engineering in a pre-electronic age , machines far in advance of anything that victorian technology could create , a machine we would later know as the robot .
your world is ours . you — mt : as i was saying , besides the faces and bodies we give our robots , we cannot read their intentions , and that makes us nervous .
technology can do the same .
so it 's 2006 .
i was seven . i did not understand .
there 's no question about it .
so i think it 's time for us to be comfortable with the uncomfortable conversation about race : black , white , asian , hispanic , male , female , all of us , if we truly believe in equal rights and equal opportunity in america , about this issue .

so that 's my feeling about that .
um , well , i , i want to start by saying that this is a very difficult experience for a chinese-american .
" what 's the most popular diet these days ? "
i have me a home . you do too .
what does that mean ?
this is a picture of sea ice taken flying over the arctic .
all of those things are emergent properties .
we can look at other examples .
the weather is a little bit different to what actually happened .
the models are skillful , but what we do with the information from those models is totally up to you .
once we 've discovered somebody has low vision , the next big challenge is to work out why , and to be able to do that , we need to have access to the inside of the eye .
those blue pins that drop represent elders , or local leaders , that are connected to those people who can ensure that we can find them and arrange treatment .
i want to take a look at what 's really behind this march of athletic progress .
rather than blocks , jesse owens had a gardening trowel that he had to use to dig holes in the cinders to start from .
the record is always trending downward , but it 's punctuated by these steep cliffs .
in fact , if you plot on a height versus mass graph one data point for each of two dozen sports in the first half of the 20th century , it looks like this .
not only are nba players ridiculously tall , they are ludicrously long .
and they happen , on average , to have a certain unique physiology : legs that are very long and very thin at their extremity , and this is because they have their ancestry at very low latitude in a very hot and dry climate , and an evolutionary adaptation to that is limbs that are very long and very thin at the extremity for cooling purposes .
they have to run like this .
but autism is not a single condition .
it was actually retracted from the journal lancet , in which it was published , and that author , a physician , had his medical license taken away from him .
and when you look at those concordance ratios , one of the striking things that you will see is that in identical twins , that concordance rate is 77 percent .
in doing so , i apologize , i 'm going to use an outdated analogy of encyclopedias rather than wikipedia , but i 'm going to do so to try and help make the point that as we did this inventory , we needed to be able to look at massive amounts of information .
in this particular child , you can see , it 's not making good eye contact .

so to explore this idea , i built an army of small robots , and each of these robots has what are called omni wheels .
there 's no technology visible at all .
so biologically , there are plenty of species that display banding or patterns , warning patterns , to either be cryptical in the water or warn against being attacked , not the least of which is the pilot fish which spends a big slab of its life around the business end of a shark .
and here 's an example of one of the first drawings .
so here we 've got a four-meter tiger shark engaging the black control rig , which it had encountered about a minute and a half before .
thank you .
the curves are kind of subtle .
this is from the mid- ' 60s , the change from metal type to photo , hot to cold .
the distinction between a constraint and a compromise is obviously very subtle , but it 's very central to my attitude to work .
the numbers at the bottom of the slide , by the way , they represent the amount of data needed to store each of the fonts .
what had started as a technical exercise became an aesthetic exercise , really .
so did my typeface .
so i 'm a pragmatist , not an idealist , out of necessity .
the universe is teeming with planets .
one more time , ten times further away .
so there 's that big screen , and there 's no planets , because unfortunately it doesn 't actually work very well , because the light waves of the light and waves diffracts around that screen the same way it did in the telescope .
we 've been working on this for the last five or six years .
thank you .
and indeed i 've treated a lot of people who were born without gonads .
i was intrigued in going to a conference in holland , where they are experts in this , and saw the most remarkable thing .
by my showing them the kids before and after , people who never got treated and people who wished to be treated , and pictures of the dutch , they came to me and said , " you 've got to do something for these kids . "
and she ended up 5 ' 11 " but more than that , she has normal breast size , because by blocking testosterone , every one of our patients has normal breast size if they get to us at the appropriate age , not too late .
if they see me , they 'll understand why i 'm no threat in the lady 's room , but i can be threatened in the men 's room . "
and it is amazing the variety that one finds on those shelves .
for three years , and children are not the problem .
rather than them working for us , we began to work for them , because within only a matter of decades it became clear : if we wanted our kids to succeed , school was not enough .
and you know what ? i 'm doing okay .
they spend more time with their kids than their fathers ever spent with them .
a child 's happiness is a very unfair burden to place on a parent .
it was the hippocratic oath , and i didn 't even know i was saying it .
he wants to build , create , create companies , create innovation .
in order to find yourself , you have to lose yourself .
pat mitchell : that day , january 8 , 2011 , began like all others .
that to say , when you look at the picture behind us , to come back from that kind of injury and come back strong and stronger than ever is a really tough thing to do .
gg : i 'm optimistic . it will be a long , hard haul , but i 'm optimistic .
gg : no , no , no .
we had one of those commuter marriages .
she was the biggest supporter of my career , and i knew it was the right thing to do .
pm : your relationship is deeper .
what are you doing that 's different than other efforts to balance rights for gun ownership and responsibilities ?
because this is the ted stage , gabby , i know you worked very hard to think of the ideas that you wanted to leave with this audience .
the reason , i would come to find out , was that their prosthetic sockets were painful because they did not fit well .
curiosity and wonder , because it drives us to explore , because we 're surrounded by things we can 't see .
and what we learn can lead us to new kinds of robotic flyers that can expand our vision of important and remote places .
tiny chemical machines of the future can one day , perhaps , repair dna .
they may not even have the degrees to be able to have anything to call an education .
there are teachers who , despite all their challenges , who have those skills , get into those schools and are able to engage an audience , and the administrator walks by and says , " wow , he 's so good , i wish all my teachers could be that good . "
cities are fundamentally about people , and where people go and where people meet are at the core of what makes a city work .
so here you see a familiar sight .
so we came up with a radical , almost insane idea .
so that meant using one of our greatest assets : our transit system .
here you see what was two miles of abandoned , degraded waterfront in the neighborhoods of greenpoint and williamsburg in brooklyn , impossible to get to and impossible to use .
and i love when people come there and look up and they say , " wow , there 's brooklyn , and it 's so close . "
and when i saw it the first time , honestly , when i went up on that old viaduct , i fell in love the way you fall in love with a person , honestly .
if there is any one lesson that i have learned in my life as a city planner , it is that public spaces have power .
you 're familiar with his poetry .
it was just before i was going to give my first ted talk .
it was about six weeks before i gave my ted talk , and i was so grateful to chris that he asked me to give this ted talk , not because i had the chance to talk to you , although that was great , but because it pulled me out of an extraordinary depression .
now politicians and pundits tell you , there 's nothing we can do about this issue , americans don 't care about it , but the reason for that is that 91 percent of americans think there 's nothing that can be done about this issue .
and then finally number three , the hardest .
and it 's also become a much more interactive place , where people are interacting with others , they 're commenting , they 're sharing , they 're not just reading .
we can do all of this really well .
it 's a hard thing to sit down and explain to an average user , and even if you do , what can the average user do about it ?
it 's possible , but i don 't think it 's something that we 're going to see change quickly .
melinda gates : with those big glasses , huh ? this is in africa , our very first trip , the first time either of us had ever been to africa , in the fall of 1993 .
how on earth do you decide what to focus on ?
bill , this is your graph . what 's this about ?
these causes have been a bit invisible .
but we don 't every minute together , that 's for sure .
she 'll sit down with the employees a lot .
it took three more years to get it than we expected , and then there was no way it was going to get out there .
their children , their six children , the two in the middle were twins , 13 , a boy , and a girl named grace .
you 've easily got enough money to make them all billionaires .
i mean , the beauty of philanthropy is this mind-blowing diversity .
mg : but you change systems .
given the scale that twitter is at , a one-in-a-million chance happens 500 times a day .
so okay , determining whether or not something is abusive without context , definitely hard .
and that 's not just an issue for me , or for twitter , it 's an issue for you .
there 's more in that picture than just a cat .
it 's small , and it typically lives alone , but it can gather in these large red swarms that span for meters , and these form because of a parasite .
the tapeworm and the gordian worm are not alone .
this caterpillar is a head-banging zombie bodyguard defending the offspring of the creature that killed it .
and once there , she lays an egg on it , egg hatches , devoured alive , bursts out of body , yadda yadda yadda , you know the drill .
it 's a classic tale of eat , prey , love .
but given the widespread nature of such manipulations , it would be completely implausible for humans to be the only species that weren 't similarly affected .
i followed the path of most kids who are genetically programmed to make their parents crazy .
and there was something about this place , i didn 't know why , that just felt special .
for the first time , i realized people were smart 2,000 years ago . this had never crossed my mind .
and this led me to embrace and want to be in both worlds .
talk about one giant leap : it 's hard to imagine a more profound moment in human history than when we first left our world to set foot on another .
today , these roads that interconnect our world are dominated by cars and trucks that have remained largely unchanged for 100 years .
machine vision , special sensors , and high-performance computing can do a lot of this , but it turns out a lot is not good enough when your family is on board .
we had edward snowden here a couple days ago , and this is response time .
first off , there 's their supervisor , and up through the supervisory chain within their organization .
rl : so there are , when our legitimate foreign intelligence targets of the type that i described before , use the global telecommunications system as their communications methodology , and they do , because it 's a great system , it 's the most complex system ever devised by man , and it is a wonder , and lots of folks in the room there are responsible for the creation and enhancement of that , and it 's just a wonderful thing .
rl : i do understand that , and i actually share the view of the utility of the internet , and i would argue it 's bigger than the internet .
and so it 's being picked up by people as a marketing advantage , and it 's being marketed that way by several countries , including some of our allied countries , where they are saying , " hey , you can 't trust the u.s. , but you can trust our telecom company , because we 're safe . "
do they have any privacy rights ?
an old boss of mine , tom fargo , admiral fargo , used to describe it as arcs of instability .
okay , so a couple of things here , because this is really the core of this , almost .
but that actually indicates a lack of understanding of how terrorist investigations actually work .
one is , you said weaken encryption . i didn 't .
this is something that the attorney general of the united states and the president also actually have both talked about this , and i defer to the attorney general , because this is his lane .
so that 's the idea worth spreading .
but why do i have to go to school ?
well , that uses anonymous companies too .
now , at this point you might be imagining one of those lovely tropical island tax havens but here 's the thing , shockingly , my own hometown , london , and indeed the u.k. , is one of the best places in the world to set up an anonymous company .
you can simply keep adding layers , companies owned by companies .
why should tax evaders , corrupt government officials , arms traders and more , be able to hide their identities from us , the public ?
now , a simple starting point is the address behind me for a facebook page that you can join now to support the campaign and spread the word .
or another way to say it is , what 's the most dangerous thing that you 've ever done ?
it 's shaking you so hard you can 't focus on the instruments in front of you .
it 's an entirely different perspective , you 're not looking up at the universe , you and the earth are going through the universe together .
and if you 're in canada , because of the cold winters here in b.c. , there 's about 720 , 730 different types of spiders and there 's one -- one -- that is venomous , and its venom isn 't even fatal , it 's just kind of like a nasty sting .
and not just underwater , but also in virtual reality labs with the helmet and the gloves so you feel like it 's realistic .
these two parts here actually melt , we jettison them and they burn up in the atmosphere .
i met joe 13 years ago on the lifer wing at wormwood scrubs high-security prison in london .
the prison warden , looking equally indifferent , said , " any trouble , just press the red buzzer , and we 'll be around as soon as we can . "
it is thought to be key to the experience of empathy .
so can brains change ?
of course , imprisonment is a necessary part of the criminal justice system and of protecting society .
in order to answer complex questions like that , we need people of different backgrounds -- lab-based scientists and clinicians , social workers and policy makers , philanthropists and human rights activists — to work together .
the underground railroad was a brilliant hack .
now the site itself was easy enough to build , but the team was faced with the challenge of how they populate all of the content .
but instead of taking to the streets , they issued a challenge .
so what i 'd like to do is have you raise your hand if you 've ever heard a heterosexual couple having sex .
the idea is that , as part of human nature , from the beginning of our species ' time , men have sort of leased women 's reproductive potential by providing them with certain goods and services .
i 'm not saying that they didn 't love the people they were having sex with .
the one thing i 'll call your attention to right away is the little musical note above the female chimp and bonobo and human .
women have hundreds of partners .
thank you . christopher ryan : thank you .
and by sustainability , i mean the really juicy things , like environmental and social issues and corporate governance .
well , the really cool thing is that most ceos are .
the answer that may surprise you is yes .
calpers is the pension fund for public employees in california , and with assets of 244 billion [ dollars ] , they are the second largest in the u.s.
the global stock market is worth 55 trillion dollars .
thank you .
since the paisley snail , and especially over the past decade or so , a great deal of thinking has been developed around the notion of a duty of care as it relates to a number of aspects of civil society .
as i see it , filmmakers , journalists , even bloggers are all required to face up to the social expectations that come with combining the intrinsic power of their medium with their well-honed professional skills .
fifty years ago this week , president john f. kennedy made two epoch-making speeches , the first on disarmament and the second on civil rights .
in the beginning , the system is disorganized .
and i decided that , in fact , i didn 't really want to create complicated stuff .
we knew that primates and elephants and dolphins could do that , but compared to bats , they have huge brains .
there is one dominant pair , and many subordinates , some acting as sentinels , some acting as babysitters , some teaching pups , and so on .
when the dominant female gives way to a subordinate , it 's not out of courtesy .
i 'd like to reimagine education .
and the person you see at the end of the stage is not madonna .
7,200 is also a big number .
and so since then , our life has changed .
and the only way we discovered this was they wrote a blog and we happened to stumble upon that blog .
the second idea is self-pacing .
in fact , one of our learners who took the circuits course early last year , he then went on to take a software course from berkeley at the end of the year , and this is what the learner had to say on our discussion board when he just started that course about the green check mark : & amp ; quot ; oh god ; have i missed you . & amp ; quot ; when 's the last time you 've seen students posting comments like this about homework ?
and then i sat back , fascinated .
thank you . thank you .
the hard approach , basically is that you start from strategy , requirements , structures , processes , systems , kpis , scorecards , committees , headquarters , hubs , clusters , you name it .
what percentage of these people is variable compensation ?
no wonder they disengage .
and we go for a second tv or we escalate the decision above for arbitration .
you can increase the shadow of the future .
complicatedness : this is your battle , business leaders .
now sexuality is an incredibly powerful lens with which to study any society , because what happens in our intimate lives is reflected by forces on a bigger stage : in politics and economics , in religion and tradition , in gender and generations .
and around the fortress is this vast field of taboo against premarital sex , against condoms , against abortion , against homosexuality , you name it .
but the man , he is still at the prehistoric stage . "
but in fact , they come from a 10th-century arabic book called " the encyclopedia of pleasure , " which covers sex from aphrodisiacs to zoophilia , and everything in between .
but i am optimistic that , in the long run , times are changing , and they and their ideas will gain ground .
could that hole in reality open up and swallow me ?
but i was scared , and the idea of taking the existential elevator to see my granddad sounded a lot better than being swallowed by the void while i slept .
this is a bias that has shaped the course of human history .
but our desire to believe this story is so deeply embedded that we are reinventing it again for the scientific age , for example , with the idea of cryonics .
so the question is , are we doomed to lead the one life we have in a way that is shaped by fear and denial , or can we overcome this bias ?
thank you .
now each year , as new snow lands on the glacier , it melts in the summer sun , and it forms little rivers of water on the flow along the ice , and they start to melt and bore their way down through the glacier , forming big networks of caves , sometimes going all the way down to the underlying bedrock .
so when you 're done surveying , you take all this data and you punch it into a computer and you find someone that can draw really well , and you have them draft up a map that looks something like this , and it 'll show you both a bird 's-eye view of the passage as well as a profile view of the passage , kind of like an ant farm view .
as these caves form and melt their way up into the ice , they make these artifacts rain down from the ceiling and fall onto the cave floor , where we end up finding them .
now for as long as i can remember , my job has been to take people out into nature , and so i think it 's a lovely twist of fate today to have the opportunity to bring some of my experiences out in nature in to this gathering .
he would never have a lot of money , but he was to be one of the richest men i would ever meet .
solly remained on the bank .
i make an instant decision that i 'll never look at that again .
now although the root word is about people , i thought that maybe ubuntu was only about people .
and on the third attempt , an amazing thing happened .
you know , he used to go to a rugby match and we would win .
i would propose two kinds which both have much to do with cities .
just as fish need to swim or birds need to fly or deer need to run , we need to walk .
and just as busways are , protected bikeways also are a powerful symbol of democracy , because they show that a citizen on a $ 30 bicycle is equally important to one in a $ 30,000 car .
children will walk out of homes into safe spaces .
in this way , their cities could grow in the right places with the right spaces , with the parks , with the greenways , with the busways .
all of a sudden , you get a very clear understanding of the very spooky conditions under which male lions do their hunting .
so our imagery is 3d , it 's chemical , it 's biological , and this tells us not only the species that are living in the canopy , but it tells us a lot of information about the rest of the species that occupy the rainforest .
we can fly to this area in northern peru and see super high carbon stocks in red , and the amazon river and floodplain cutting right through it .
this area happens to be on the border of peru and brazil , totally unexplored , almost totally unknown scientifically .
and when we take this together and scale up to the regional level , we get a completely new geography of biodiversity unknown prior to this work .
i 'm hoping to actually put the technology into orbit so we can manage the entire planet with technologies like this .
we could even have four thumbs together , and the way you win is you 're the first person to pin someone else 's thumb .
this is called the death star configuration .
did you win ? you got it ? you got it ? excellent !
when was the last time you were at ted and you got to connect physically with every single person in the room ?
yes . awesome . okay .
now as it turns out , i 'm somebody who thinks a lot about data , as you 'll soon find .
now , i like the idea of online dating , because it 's predicated on an algorithm , and that 's really just a simple way of saying i 've got a problem , i 'm going to use some data , run it through a system and get to a solution .
the algorithm matched us up because we share a love of gadgets , we share a love of math and data and ' 80s music , and so i agreed to go out with him .
these algorithms were doing exactly what they were designed to do , which was to take our user-generated information , in my case , my résumé , and match it up with other people 's information .
so what i did was , i went through and i prioritized that list .
she likes to make people laugh " alot . "
also , optimistic language matters a lot .
because remember , in my scoring system , they have to reach a minimum threshold of 700 points , and none of them have done that .

this was a tradition in ancient warfare called single combat .
and the shepherd draws closer and closer , and the giant sees that he 's carrying a staff .
when david rolls it around like this , he 's turning the sling around probably at six or seven revolutions per second , and that means that when the rock is released , it 's going forward really fast , probably 35 meters per second .
goliath is a sitting duck . he doesn 't have a chance .
well , it turns out that there 's been a great deal of speculation within the medical community over the years about whether there is something fundamentally wrong with goliath , an attempt to make sense of all of those apparent anomalies .
when he says , " come to me that i might feed your flesh to the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the field , " the phrase " come to me " is a hint also of his vulnerability .
so the effect that this stroke could have on mario 's body could be the fact that he couldn 't be able to control the left side of his body .
so immediately , as francesca said , we changed our life .
but we want to share what was the key learning , the key learning that mario drove to us , and it is to consider what you have as a gift and not only what you miss , and to consider what you miss just as an opportunity .
several year later , i managed to successfully fail all of my exams and didn 't really leave school with much to show for at all , and my parents , maybe as a reward , bought me what turned out to be and i came back home about four years later .
and i was told that i wouldn 't be able to do this , that 's the thing that makes you do it .
so for example , we 've created a newspaper , a regular newspaper .
okay . thanks .
five years ago , for instance , i found myself waking each morning in misty seattle to what i knew was an impossible question : one desert night , half the world and almost half of history away ?
he was overwhelmed not with conviction , but by doubt .
like fundamentalists of all religious stripes , they have no questions , only answers .
and i , for one , refuse to live that way .
a few hundred billion dollars of losses in the financial sector of losses in world gdp in the global stock market .
remember , black swan is this rare bird that all swans should be white , so it has captured the idea of unpredictability , unknowability , that the extreme events are fundamentally unknowable .
this is rooted in 30 years of history of bubbles , starting in 1980 , with the global bubble followed by many other bubbles .
so how can we be so collectively wrong by misreading or ignoring the science of the fact that when an instability has developed , and the system is ripe , any perturbation makes it essentially impossible to control ?
we don 't release the report . it 's kept secret .

you may not recognize me because i used to part my hair differently there .
picture yourselves around the table in brussels .
and our fears led to a blind faith in the orthodoxy of austerity .
so let 's try something else .
i 'm talking about , how do we secure the space , the demos , the platform of values , so that we can tap into all of your potential ?
it was not a good decision , clearly , but how do you feel after that , not as the prime minister , but as george ?
quads are extremely agile , but this agility comes at a cost .
you can notice that this quad is making fine adjustments to keep the pole balanced .
in this instance , carrying a glass of water is easy .
how do we make a machine do what an athlete does seemingly without effort ?
we now have a natural way of interacting with the raw athleticism of these quads with my gestures .
similarly , we use the analogy of sports and athleticism to create new algorithms for machines to push them to their limits .
how did i do this ?
but that 's kind of a big problem .
but my problem was , i didn 't have the money to pay for them . i couldn 't afford them .
and it was an amazing collaboration to work with this great artist whom i admire .
they were large . they were hairy .
so if we were to go deep now within the bones and the teeth that actually survived the fossilization process , the dna which was once intact , tightly wrapped around histone proteins , is now under attack by the bacteria that lived symbiotically with the mammoth for years during its lifetime .
where are you going to house a mammoth ?
in fact , i 'm going to argue that these are men 's issues , first and foremost .
this comes from the work of the feminist linguist julia penelope .
what a stupid thing to do . why was she drinking with that group of guys in that hotel room ?
because this isn 't about individual perpetrators .
but one of the powerful roles that men can play in this work is that we can say some things that sometimes women can 't say , or , better yet , we can be heard saying some things that women often can 't be heard saying .
there 's a whole spectrum .
now , among the many great things that martin luther king said in his short life was , " in the end , what will hurt the most is not the words of our enemies but the silence of our friends . "
if we can make this point that i 'm making to powerful men and women in our society at all levels of institutional authority and power , it 's going to change , it 's going to change the paradigm of people 's thinking .
but we also owe it to our sons .
the uncomfortable fact is that actually almost everything that we call architecture today is actually the business of designing for about the richest one percent of the world 's population , and it always has been .
architects are actually really , really good at this kind of resourceful , strategic thinking .
right ? when suddenly you had a 3d printer that was open-source , the parts for which could be made on another 3d printer .
we 're shifting our heads here , so the house is not a finished product .
we 're aware that wikihouse is a very , very small answer , but it 's a small answer to a really , really big question , which is that globally , right now , the fastest-growing cities are not skyscraper cities .
and my relationship to especially human-made objects which someone else said they work like this , well , i can say they work a different way , a little bit .
he doesn 't know , but he can show you . "
what 's awesome is what happens when you give the piano circuit to people .
and then we came up with this idea to not just use electronics , but let 's just smash computers with everyday objects and see how that goes over .
aluminum foil . everybody has a cat .
but it 's also very serious because all this accessibility stuff started coming up , where people can 't use computers , necessarily .
that 's an open buggy . it doesn 't have heating .
it maxes out in the 1930s , ' 40s and ' 50s , and then it starts slowing down , and here 's a cautionary note .
the first headwind is demographics .
if so , that 's going to require that our inventions are as important as the ones that happened over the last 150 years .
what about the internal combustion engine , which was invented in 1879 ?
it 's amazing . the mainframe computer was invented in 1942 .
so as i said , neurosurgery comes from a long tradition .
once you choose the right station , whether it be jazz or opera , in our case whether it be movement or mood , we can put the dial there , and then we can use a second button to adjust the volume , to turn it up or turn it down .
we want you to stop doing that . "
on the basis of this result , this is now a procedure that 's done throughout the world , and there have been hundreds of children that have been helped with this kind of surgery .
i 've shown you that we can use deep brain stimulation to treat the motor system in cases of parkinson 's disease and dystonia .
so this is what we did . we implanted electrodes in the fornix of patients with alzheimer 's disease , we turned it on , and we looked at what happens to glucose use in the brain .
and i think that we will see that we will be able to chase more of these evil spirits out from the brain as time goes on , and the consequence of that , of course , will be that we will be able to help many more patients .
so we 've got some video here of the tesla being assembled , which , if we could play that first video -- so what is innovative about this process in this vehicle ?
i think that 's really a profound difference , and people only experience that when they have a test drive .
so it 's common -- don 't expect to be out of here in 10 minutes .
em : no , we actually are . you can buy a solar system or you can lease a solar system .
with that capital , solarcity purchases and installs the panel on the roof and then charges the homeowner or business owner a monthly lease payment , which is less than the utility bill .
obviously , " he started with a large one , " is the punchline .
em : since our primary competitors are national governments , the enforceability of patents is questionable . that 's really , really interesting .
em : yeah , exactly . spacex , or some combination of companies and governments , needs to make progress in the direction of making life multi-planetary , of establishing a base on another planet , on mars -- being the only realistic option -- and then building that base up until we 're a true multi-planet species .
i mean , almost no one can do that .
look at that . just take a bow . that was fantastic .
mm : and that linking of the digital content to something that 's physical is what we call an aura , and i 'll be using that term a little bit as we go through the talk .
teacher : now move it either side . see what happens .
if you have a good wi-fi connection or 3g , this process is very , very quick .
and so that 's a masterpiece , which is a fake of a masterpiece , and bonded into the canvas is a chip which identifies that as a real fake , if you see what i mean .
so if you drop your card in the street , it means a criminal can pick it up and read it .
i mean , they generally are , when you look in the paper , right ?
what she should have said is , " my lawyer will be calling you first thing in the morning .
so i thought , well , look .
but if i have to prove who i am , i 'll never send that message .
come on , you guys must have seen doctor who 's psychic paper .
so when you want to draw money out , you put the mobile phone on the atm , and touch your finger , your fingerprint goes through to the phone , the phone says yes , that 's whoever , and the atm then gives you some money .
if you 've ever been up to the big city , and used an oyster card at all , does that ring any bells to anybody ?
you were sitting on your couch and you decided that you absolutely had to have this red t-shirt .
turns out e-commerce was something that was very hard and very costly .
in this particular case , we challenged ourselves with the idea : what if we had to build a distribution center in china , where it 's a very , very low-cost market ?
you stand up , i 'll squat down .
so they do red , green and blue , not just a part of the order .
so whether you 're doing two pick stations , 20 pick stations , or 200 pick stations , the path planning algorithms and all of the inventory algorithms just work .
so what i wanted to leave you with today is the notion that when you let things start to think and walk and talk on their own , interesting processes and productivities can emerge .
you answer a lot of questions , and this is supposed to reveal something about your core personality .
we have knowledge .
you are the sum of your parts .
now if everything else in the universe is like this , why are we different ?
these are three psychologists , thomas metzinger , bruce hood , susan blackmore , a lot of these people do talk the language of illusion , the self is an illusion , it 's a fiction .
but if you think of yourself as being , in a way , not a thing as such , but a kind of a process , something that is changing , then i think that 's quite liberating .
what i 'm going to do is , i 'm going to explain to you an extreme green concept that was developed at nasa 's glenn research center in cleveland , ohio .
do not use arable land .
so on large scale what do they use ?
the 20 percent that 's missing is nitrogen and phosphorous .
it 's called seashore mallow . kosteletzkya virginica — say that five times fast if you can .
and last , garlic with salicornia , which is what i like .
we have the ability to do that , and i think it 's going to work .
i first learned about it through a lawsuit i read about in my doctor 's office -- which was between the physician 's committee for responsible medicine and seven different fast food restaurants .
and the soy sauce results were inconclusive because of the large data range , but it seems like soy sauce actually increased the potential carcinogens .
and then came the summer after my freshman year , when my grandfather passed away due to cancer .
and we wanted to figure this out , because if we could figure that out , then we might be able to prevent that resistance from ever happening .
naomi shah : hi everyone . i 'm naomi shah , and today i 'll be talking to you about my research involving indoor air quality and asthmatic patients .
and i have a volunteer subject in the audience today , julie .
because these environmental solutions that julie can make in her home , her workplace and her school are impacting everyone that lives around her .
at the age of 19 , the day after i graduated high school , i moved to a place where it snowed and i became a massage therapist .
or as short as i wanted , depending on who i was dating .
from there , i had the opportunity to go to south africa , where i helped to put shoes on thousands of children 's feet so they could attend school .
i believe in randomness , and one of the reasons i believe that is because me becoming a diplomat was random .
and as those numbers suggest , i was inducted into an elite and fascinating and exhilarating world .
we went through several wars during my time in new york .
i had been steeped in the intelligence on iraq and its wmd , and my testimony to the inquiry said three things : that the government exaggerated the intelligence , which was very clear in all the years i 'd read it .
a second thing happened in kosovo , which kind of -- i need a quick gulp of water , forgive me .
there was this whole fancy diplomatic system , this negotiation process about the future of kosovo , and the kosovars weren 't part of it .
and kosovo became independent .
there are , i don 't know , some lessons from all of this , personal and political -- and in a way , they 're the same thing .
and independent diplomat is a kind of example of this in a sort of loose way .
and of course , nothing happened -- nobody did anything .
it 's also good news , because the planetary risks we 're facing are so large , that business as usual is not an option .
the second pressure on the planet is , of course the climate agenda -- the big issue -- where the policy interpretation of science is that it would be enough to stabilize greenhouse gases at 450 ppm to avoid average temperatures exceeding two degrees , to avoid the risk that we may be destabilizing the west antarctic ice sheet , holding six meters -- level rising , the risk of destabilizing the greenland ice sheet , holding another seven meters -- sea level rising .
no scientist could predict that in 2007 , suddenly , what could be crossing a threshold .
but it shows that we are interconnected , among many systems on the planet , with the three big systems , climate change , stratospheric ozone depletion and ocean acidification being the three big systems , where the scientific evidence of large-scale thresholds in the paleo-record of the history of the planet .
the drama is , of course , is that 200 countries on this planet have to simultaneously start moving in the same direction .
it has to basically do this on current land .
in fact , what we have to do over the next 40 years is much more dramatic and more exciting than what we did when we moved into the situation we 're in today .
it 's been deployed in washington d.c. to track snow cleanup .
and it 's those two things together -- ancient human motivation and the modern tools to allow that motivation to be joined up in large-scale efforts -- that are the new design resource .
and that source is design for generosity .
by adding a fine , what they did was communicate to the parents that their entire debt to the teachers had been discharged with the payment of 10 shekels , and that there was no residue of guilt or social concern that the parents owed the teachers .
i have a hard time envisioning a future in which someone is saying , " where , oh where , can i find a picture of a cute cat ? "
youtube cares deeply about the rights of content owners , but in order to give them choices about what they can do with copies , mashups and more , we need to first identify when copyrighted material is uploaded to our site .
well , most rights owners , instead of blocking , will allow the copy to be published .
and all it took to change things around was to allow for choice through rights identification .
i think they were given to tedsters in a box , a box set of dvds , which they put on their shelves , where they are now .
very many people go through their whole lives having no real sense of what their talents may be , or if they have any to speak of .
you have to create the circumstances where they show themselves .
" as our case is new , so we must think anew and act anew .
kids now live in a world which is digitized , and the time , for them , is everywhere .
and i was up in san francisco a while ago doing a book signing .
when i arrived in l.a.
and we have sold ourselves into a fast food model of education , and it 's impoverishing our spirit and our energies as much as fast food is depleting our physical bodies .
we have to move to a model that is based more on principles of agriculture .
and he says , " i 've got something else , but it may not be for you . "
punta espinosa is where i lived for over a year , and we call it uninhabited because there are no people there .
i thought i was going to study the social behavior of galapagos penguins , but you already know penguins are rare .
that brings all the nutrients : when this is cold in the galapagos , it 's rich , and there 's plenty of food for everyone .
we know this because of long-term science , because we have long-term studies there .
these little blue dots are the fledglings -- we do this survey every march -- which means that they 're only in the environment from january until march , so maybe three months at the most that they could get covered in oil .
the same thing 's true for penguins as well .
and you 'll see soon that my graduate student ...
you can see this penguin , he goes over , he looks at those wires , does not like that wire .
about three and a half years ago i made a discovery .
well , as a result , the way we think , the way we act , the way we communicate is from the outside in .
totally different right ? you 're ready to buy a computer from me .
the goal is to do business with people who believe what you believe .
but if you don 't know why you do what you do , and people respond to why you do what you do , then how will you ever get people to vote for you , or buy something from you , or , more importantly , be loyal and want to be a part of what it is that you do .
the difference was , orville and wilbur were driven by a cause , by a purpose , by a belief .
the next 13 and a half percent of our population are our early adopters .
the reason that person bought the iphone in the first six hours , stood in line for six hours , was because of what they believed about the world , and how they wanted everybody to see them : they were first .
you 're scaring us . "
it 's what they believed about america that got them to travel in a bus for eight hours to stand in the sun in washington in the middle of august .
in the eyes of many people , after the animals are seized , they say , " yay , justice has been served .
on the middle , this guy nested a couple of weeks after the release .
now , we also do some pretty amazing things with these phones .
and looking at that pattern . and what does that decline in social health mean , as a kind of a vital sign of the future ?
you know , back in 2000 , we were all so obsessed with paying attention to the aging of our computers , and whether or not they were going to survive the tick of the clock from 1999 to 2000 , that we missed a moment that only demographers were paying attention to .
so , one of the reasons it 's so challenging to prepare for this y2k problem is , i want to argue , we have what i would call mainframe poisoning .
the second that comes up is " hospital . " and the third is " illness " or " sickness . " right ?
i want to give you a couple of examples . this is mimi from one of our studies -- in her 90s , had to move out of her home because her family was worried about falls .
it has accelerometry . you can plug in a three-lead ecg .
you can go to orcatech.org -- it has nothing to do with whales , it 's the oregon center for aging and technology -- to see more about that .
thanks very much .
technology is moving ahead , and these large cargo scanner x-rays that work with the digital system are getting better and better and better .
but i quite love the way it 's posed .
so , i have to use a 1980s drum scanner , which was designed in the days when everyone shot photographs on film .
and getting a hold of that was extremely difficult and laborious .
the fact that it 's a child 's toy that we all recognize , but also it looks like it 's a robot , and it comes from a sci-fi genus .
and the x-ray shows how beautiful nature can be .
so , what am i doing in the future ?
is that an idea that you believe in , and how would you define that ?
gb : well i think we can persuade people that what is necessary for britain 's long-term interests , what is necessary for america 's long-term interests , is proper engagement with the rest of the world , and taking the action that is necessary .
one end of the beach there is a house containing a family of five nigerians .
so , i think you 're dealing with something that people instinctively see as part of that moral sense .
and you have politicians who have -- you 're elected . in a way , you can 't say that .
yes . and then of course the theory is still that those talks get rent apart by different countries fighting over their own individual interests .
and the story is told that bill clinton went to god and he asked when there will be successful climate change and a low carbon economy .
so it allows it to roll .
and here is a similar sculpture .
it 's susceptible to motion by the air currents .
this has a diamond-bottomed lake .
so it can see its environment , and then it can mimic its environment and disappear .
it would also be able to be an open code , so people could interact with it .
they 're ingenious , perhaps , but not analytical , " and when these concepts underly our teaching and what we think about the world , then we have a problem , because we by accepting this dichotomy , whether it 's tongue-in-cheek , when we attempt to accommodate it in our world , and we try to build our foundation for the world , we 're messing up the future , because , who wants to be uncreative ?
each one of them are different manifestations , incarnations , of creativity , avatars of human creativity , and that 's what we have to reconcile in our minds , how these things fit together .
it 's the universe , as experienced by everyone , and the arts manifest our desire , our attempt to share or influence others through experiences that are peculiar to us as individuals .
our successes and our failures influence what we do with all of those , and to me , design and engineering , craftsmanship and skilled labor , are all the things that work on this to have our outcome , which is our human quality of life .
we have to pay attention to it . i just want to tell you really quickly what i 'm doing .
we 're going to share lots of things with people , but nothing 's going to happen until we risk putting those ideas into action .
the blast is so strong it can even break your limbs , even if you 're not hit .
one of the people that i recently met with was an air force three-star general , and he said basically , where we 're headed very soon is tens of thousands of robots operating in our conflicts , and these numbers matter , because we 're not just talking about tens of thousands of today 's robots , but tens of thousands of these prototypes and tomorrow 's robots , because of course , one of the things that 's operating in technology is moore 's law , that you can pack in more and more computing power into those robots , and so flash forward around 25 years , if moore 's law holds true , those robots will be close to a billion times more powerful in their computing than today .
this cross between robotics and things like terrorism is going to be fascinating and even disturbing , and we 've already seen it start .
but remember , this is taking place in our strange , weird world , and so inevitably the ability to download these video clips to , you know , your ipod or your zune gives you the ability to turn it into entertainment .
described of his experience fighting in the iraq war while never leaving nevada .
they don 't commit crimes of rage and revenge .
thank you .
it 's a free program you download for your mac or pc , and you make free phone calls anywhere in the world the downside is that you have to wear a headset like a nerd .
i 'm like , can you imagine being the t-mobile pr lady ? you know ?
dp : you 're on wi-fi . how does it sound ?
ok . would you call me please right now ? [ phone number given . ] and don 't you all call me at three a.m. asking me to fix your printer .
and i want these people to hear this greeting , " hi boss , i 'm out making us both some money . leave a message . "
and it 's already written down -- so , like , if you 're driving , you don 't have to do one of these things , " uh huh , uh huh , uh huh . "
to select number one , you can press one or say " number one . "
i tried this this morning just to make sure it 's still alive .
nobody has pagers anymore .
i don 't really want people listening in to my calls . "
i 'm not kidding you . the message said , " was walking along the street " and " sky was blue " and " emergency " !
phone : did you complete that thing about a month ago ? that photocopier training ?
but it did change a few things . the first thing it changed was that all those carriers saw that they sold 10 million of these things in a year .
you know how you erase it ?
anyway , just amazing , amazing things .
a million times more rad than my phone .
thank you . thank you very much .
so we really can make changes .
1945 , it 's still most places .
and when you use indoor spraying with ddt and those nets you can cut deaths by over 50 percent .
we need mathematicians to come in and simulate this , to do monte carlo things to understand how these tools combine and work together .
not only has that been weak. it 's getting weaker .
but the more we looked at it , the more we realized that having great teachers was the very key thing .
they 've gone back and they 've gotten their master 's of education .
they have 66 schools -- mostly middle schools , some high schools -- and what goes on is great teaching .
so imagine running a factory where you 've got these workers , some of them just making crap and the management is told , " hey , you can only come down here once a year , but you need to let us know , because we might actually fool you , and try and do a good job in that one brief moment . "
and i thought it was so fantastic .
and i think that if you 're not , there 's probably something inherently wrong with the structure or the situation you 're in , if you 're a designer .
now , when i apply russell baker 's definition of solemnity or seriousness to design , it doesn 't necessarily make any particular point about quality .
i 'm hired to be solemn , but i find more and more that i 'm solemn when i don 't have to be .
i mixed up victorian designs with pop , and i mixed up art nouveau with something else .
and that is a wonderful position to be in to create some serious play .
i 'm on their board , and i still am involved with it .
they ran around corners , they went up sides of buildings , and they melded into the architecture .
by the time i did bloomberg 's headquarters my work had begun to become accepted .
i thought i was going to go crazy at the end of this year .
we began doing these big silkscreen prints , and they started selling , too .
but to really think about the implications of what this makes possible , we found that it helps to think about how it could be applied in the world .
now , we showed the concept to a few people before this , and they asked us , when 's it coming out ?
some of them automatically unroll like this one .
no , not yet .
but today it 's most widely used in office buildings -- in the sprinkler system -- as a fire-suppression fluid .
in addition , if you were to fold in one of the corners , then you could program the book to actually email you the text on the page for your notes .
so , a patient can come in and actually blow into their device .
and the story of the intermittent absorption refrigerator .
put it into a container and it will refrigerate for 24 hours .
do you think there could ?
or design out of chaos , without the aid of mind .
but the principle of universal darwinism is that any information that is varied and selected will produce design .
the whole science of memetics is much maligned , much misunderstood , much feared .
some of them will be copied even though they 're not .
what is this all about ?
so , you get an arms race between the genes which are trying to get the humans to have small economical brains and not waste their time copying all this stuff , and the memes themselves , like the sounds that people made and copied -- in other words , what turned out to be language -- competing to get the brains to get bigger and bigger .
and we 're getting there .
and on that basis , i 've suggested a different kind of equation .
how many mothers do we have here ?
why ? because the temes are selfish replicators and they don 't care about us , or our planet , or anything else .
they could carry on without us .
he said , " i think the most important thing to happen in 2006 was that living and thinking green hit main street .
and in parallel at that time , there was a very kind of exclusive design club .
so the problems of sustainability cannot be separated from the nature of the cities , of which the buildings are a part .
how does it affect the design of buildings ?
and what they were saying on this occasion was that our competitors had to build new buildings for the new technology .
so if you cross the border -- just across the border -- a small factory in germany , and here you can see the guy with his computer screen , and those points in space are communicated .
and if you looked very closely , you 'd see that people were drawing with pencils , and they were pushing , you know , big rulers and triangles .
and again , we can measure the reduction in terms of energy consumption .
and our translation of that , using a lot of the thinking built up over the 40 years , is to say , what if that , instead of being just a pipe , what if it is a lifeline ?
and i was voicing the thought that -- it just crossed my mind that new year 's eve , a sort of symbolic turning point as we move from 2006 to 2007 -- that maybe , you know , the future was the most powerful , innovative sort of nation .
this is the front of the brain , the back of brain with the spinal cord hanging down , and this is how it would be positioned inside of my head .
and our left hemisphere thinks in language .
just like someone took a remote control and pushed the mute button . total silence .
and in that moment my right arm went totally paralyzed by my side . then i realized , " oh my gosh ! i 'm having a stroke ! i 'm having a stroke ! "
and so i say to him -- clear in my mind , i say to him : " this is jill ! i need help ! "
right here , right now , i can step into the consciousness of my right hemisphere , where we are .
also in the bible , one sees that the death penalty was the accepted punishment for crimes such as homosexuality , adultery , blasphemy , idolatry , talking back to your parents -- -- and picking up sticks on the sabbath .
things that we read about in the paper with gory footage burn into memory more than reports of a lot more people dying in their beds of old age . there are dynamics in the opinion and advocacy markets : no one ever attracted observers , advocates and donors by saying things just seem to be getting better and better .
wright argues that technology has increased the number of positive-sum games that humans tend to be embroiled in , by allowing the trade of goods , services and ideas over longer distances and among larger groups of people .
the very chutzpah of somebody thinking that you could explain consciousness is just out of the question .
i want to shake your confidence that you know your own innermost minds -- that you are , yourselves , authoritative about your own consciousness .
and there 's a passage in it which i would love to share with you .
the philosopher says , " i 'm going to explain to you how that 's done .
even when you know that they 're all going to change color , it 's very hard to notice . you have to really concentrate to pick up any of the changes at all .
and i thought as i got closer i would be able to see all the detail of most people , see their clothes , and so forth .
yes .
everybody can see the two ways of seeing the cube ? ok .
this is change-blindness .
i want you to see a few that are particularly striking .

and the other is becoming paraplegic .
human beings have something that we might think of as a " psychological immune system . "
[ he was ultimately released for good behavior halfway through his sentence . ] and what did he have to say about his experience ?
and in our society , we have a strong belief that synthetic happiness is of an inferior kind .
would you like to see it again ? happiness !
" sorry , doc , i just don 't have a clue . "
dilbert already knows , of course .
they bring us the camera ; we make up a contact sheet ; they figure out which are the two best pictures ; and we now spend six hours teaching them about darkrooms .
and people who are deliberating -- " should i return it ?
we should have preferences that lead us into one future over another .
two years later we started doing a project on developing mobile health clinics in sub-saharan africa , responding to the hiv / aids pandemic .
all problems are local . all solutions are local .
and a whole variety of ideas that not only dealt with architectural building , but also the issues of governance and the idea of creating communities through complex networks .
this one i love . the idea is it 's not just a clinic -- it 's a community center .
well , my name is sisi , because i work at the african center .
a class , three classrooms and rainwater collection is 5,000 dollars .
that was their home , and these are the photographs they took .
if you 're ever , ever in india , go use this toilet .
you have a diverse community of participants -- and we 're not just talking about inventors and designers , but we 're talking about the funding model .
and i need to know that . it 's called the leap-back .
i think the man was maybe 25 years too early , so let 's do it .
