I was 11 years old , and I remember , in the morning , a little bit of joy about my friends .
My father was using his blue little laptop .
He 's listening , and it 's very rare , because most of the news 's news isn 't .
" UNK ! " UNK UNK .
I don 't know what that means , but I can look at my father .
" You can go to the real school , " he said . "
I will never forget that morning .
A real school school .
When I was six years old , there was a war in Afghanistan , and it was illegal for girls .
So after that , five years old , I was a little boy for my sister to go out of a secret school sister who had never been allowed to .
It 's the only way we have to live .
And we 're going to be in a different way , and we don 't want to ask us where to go .
We put it in food , and it 's going to take us just to buy things .
In a room , we have 100 people in the room .
The winter is UNK , but it 's very hot .
We all know that it 's dangerous to be living at risk , and the teacher and the family is very clear .
Sometimes , school will be a little bit later , because there 's a lot of UNK .
And we 're always worried about what 's going on in the Taliban .
Are we going to track ?
Do they know where we live ?
We 're afraid , but we still don 't want to go to school .
I was lucky enough to grow up with girls of girls and girls .
My grandfather was a great man in his 20s .
He was in the middle of the UNK , and he had different girls , and he kept his daughter , my mom , and he was forced to meet his father from his father .
But I 've been living for the parents for a teacher .
That 's her .
She was eight years ago , and then he turned me into a school of school , girls and women .
My father -- that 's the fact he was the first person in his family .
So , there 's no doubt , there 's no doubt that his kids should be taught about education , including his daughter , even though there 's a risk of UNK .
For him , there 's no risk of education .
I remember that when I remember my life in the Taliban , I thought , " I 'd be afraid of being afraid of my life , and it doesn 't seem to look at the future . "
I think about it , but my father is saying , " Listen , my daughter , you 're going to lose anything in your life .
Your money can be UNK , and you 're probably going to die in the war .
And the only thing you can do is to protect the story , and if we don 't want to pay your funding to pay your math , we don 't have to be married .
Even if you don 't think about it ? "
So I 'm 22 years old .
The last country I grew up in the last decade was destroyed .
I 'm at the age of the year , and there are more than six percent of the population of people who are not six percent , if I don 't have my family , and I will be a lot of people .
And today I 've been a professional UNK student .
One of the UNK at the time in America , in the U.S.
He 's not just because my college students , because there 's also one , because I 'm the first time , and I am the front of the woman who 's going to be in the streets of UNK Street .
My home is trust me .
My dream is great , but they 're much better than my expectations .
So , that 's why I became a global global global economy , which is a global education .
That 's why I 've been working with UNK UNK , which is probably one of the best girls in Afghanistan , because there 's very dangerous to that .
So , I 'm excited , and I look at the students in my school that I 've been able to go up with my school .
I 've been seeing them , especially by their father , just like my father 's home , even if you look at their faces .
So , for example , that 's not true , and I can 't tell you the last year , and he 's the father of my students .
Instead of months ago , he was working with his daughter in New York , and they were UNK UNK .
He goes up , and it 's okay , it 's a voice warning , and he 's going to go to school , and it 's going to be a little bit later .
" If you think , " He says , " He said , " I 'm not going to tell you about the future of my daughter . "
For Afghanistan , I 've realized that this is a place in the West , and it 's a long time -- he 's going to be able to understand the value of her daughter , which is the success of the woman 's success , is his own success .
It 's not that they 're not important for us .
In fact , there 's one of the first things that we have in girls , and they often talk about the most important transportation , but also in Afghanistan like Afghanistan , we have to have a male support .
In the Taliban , there 's only hundreds of people -- there 's just no hundreds of people -- please don 't forget , because sometimes it 's illegal .
But today , Afghanistan is over 300 million girls .
Afghanistan has a lot different than the United States .
I 've found that Americans can look at us , vulnerable .
I 'm worried about how long it is to be able to grow up in the U.S. military .
But when I went back to Afghanistan , and I was asked them to help their parents , I saw the hope of the future , and it 's also seeing it in the future .
For me , there 's a lot of hope for hope and infinite possibilities , and every day there is a place for me to wake up .
For me , they had a lot of dreams .
Thank you .
What I 've done is that there 's not a whole lot of people in my life -- deep up to the age of seven years in Africa .
It 's very young , and I 've been very young , but I 've been fascinated -- well , Kenya , UNK , UNK , UNK , and so on .
I 've been working on a government of NGOs , and we 've lost every project since Africa .
And I was very excited about it .
So , 12 years old , I think it 's a great benefit of people , and we 're in Africa as well for Africa .
And , of course , what 's going on ?
For the first project , I wrote to the first book , called " UNK UNK , " " UNK , " and it 's a great honor of people that we have to teach .
So , what we 've done is we 've come up with UNK , and we 've got UNK UNK , and we 're teaching UNK , which is that we 're teaching , " UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK .
Of course , there 's nothing to do with people , so we pay them to work , and they 're not going to be here .
There 's a lot of UNK , which is , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , and we 're very surprised .
But we don 't ask them , and they 're just like , " UNK us . "
" There 's a lot of money going on in hunger . "
And , of course , there are great things that are happening in Africa .
We 're beautiful , and it 's very , very large , and it 's very large , and it 's very large , and it 's very large , and it 's going to grow up here , and it 's going to grow up here .
It 's really hard to trust -- we talk to people like , " Look , there 's a lot of easy . "
When you 're at the bottom of the red , it 's nice to see , and there 's a lot of UNK that comes across the Atlantic River than two percent of the rivers .
We talk to them , " Oh , here we 're going to be dead . "
UNK to say , " Yes , it 's a reason we 're not in here . "
" Why don 't you all tell you , " " You never ask . "
I thought there 's only a lot of people who are living in Africa , but when I know what 's going on in the U.S. , the French , and when you look at the rest of the world , then I 'm very proud of what I think we 're very proud about .
Because , we are waiting for the river .
So you 've got to look at these kinds of junk -- you need to look at a lot of the Africans who are responsible for these kinds of systems .
You can read this book , " UNK , " " UNK , " " UNK , " " UNK . "
The book is published in 2009 .
We 've gone up in the last 50 years since the last 25 billion dollars in the last 50 years .
I 'm not going to be able to tell you a little bit about the money .
You read about it .
Look at the eyes of an African woman , and we have a lot of damage .
Well , we 're a religious , and we 're talking about UNK , and we 're talking about two : There 's UNK UNK .
The word " UNK , " " UNK . "
But there 's no different difference .
" The UNK , " which means my kids , " I love my children . " I love your kids . "
UNK means that I 'm going to go through another cultural background , which is to look at my own personal experience .
That 's why Africa is called " UNK , " and it 's the UNK .
So , in short books , it 's the most important thing , which is , " UNK , " because people don 't want to help . "
That should be the case of aid .
The first thing that aid aid is is UNK .
Now , in the morning , it 's going to take a look at the front page , say , " We can 't -- you can 't imagine a city isn 't a city with a city ? "
So , seven years ago , I had a choice of aid , and I had no idea of people , and I didn 't help people , and I didn 't want to get people , and I was responsible for people because of people living in people , and it 's about people who are better than people .
So what we need to do -- is to shut up .
And we 're not going to be able to be able to be in a community , and we 're not going to be able to be able to be able to put it in a different way , and you 're sitting in the audience .
We don 't have to go into the office .
We 're at the restaurant and the hotel .
We don 't have the building infrastructure .
And what we 've done is to ask them to talk to them , and find their interest and ideas .
The most important thing about it .
You can ask your perspective .
But if you 're not interested , what 's going on ?
UNK is the most important thing I 've ever mentioned .
The good thing about it is to build up on my own basis , and it 's the most important .
And then we helped them collect knowledge of knowledge and information , because it 's a little bit different , a little bit different .
There 's a little bit of people who don 't know about knowledge , but we can offer it .
So a lot of years ago , I had a thought of about how to listen to their ideas , rather than just to our ideas , but it 's not going to be in the community .
I 'm going to tell you a secret .
The community will be a problem .
entrepreneurs don 't tell you , because they 're not going to tell you what they 're going to do , and they 'll be able to find out how to do it .
So , there 's a UNK zone .
You don 't even have the smartest places in the community , because they don 't have to engage with your public .
The idea is that we 've got one of the things that we 've got to do with ourselves , and we need to build a social infrastructure that we don 't have yet .
We had to create a new industry .
So this is a professional doctor , and you 're waiting for your kitchen , or in your kitchen , or UNK , and you 're going to be able to bring your creative material into the industry .
I 've been trying to experiment with UNK UNK in UNK .
So , I was in Los Angeles , trying to get back to the dog 's UNK , and then I was just going to be just going to be able to go into the air .
So , in the first time in UNK , I 've been asked to do that , and I 've taught him to come up here in the room , and you can tell me , " You 're the guy who sold the fish , and she 's the guy who is selling it for you , and you can help us help us ? "
The UNK factory , which is a company called UNK UNK , which is called UNK UNK , which is , " Hey , you help people help them , to help us help us ? "
So , after a year , I had two projects , and the government came up and asked me , " What are you going to do ?
How do you go -- " I said , " I 've done one really bad thing .
That 's all up there , listen to them . "
-- so , the government says , " That 's what it 's like . "
We 've been working on 300 communities in the world .
We 've done hundreds of millions of companies .
The new generation of entrepreneurship is not the way we built the car .
Peter UNK , the greatest UNK of UNK , last year , years ago , back in UNK .
Peter UNK is a philosopher professor , and Peter UNK once said , " Well , it 's actually not easy to create a business society and a business economy . "
It 's a UNK for creativity .
Now , we have to look at UNK UNK , and you can 't understand how many of you think about how much money they 're going to have to do with their own money .
We need to learn how to get these guys .
We need to give them UNK , and we hate them , and we need to help them help , and then they 're going to go up the door , and they 're going to go up here .
In one 100 billion communities , we have about 200 customers .
Can you imagine a 40 billion of the community ?
Now , how many of you guys have to go through ?
It 's a UNK of creative passion , and you can 't play with them .
So , what I 'd like to say is , creativity is the trend that is society .
And when we are at the end of the first time revolution , we don 't have UNK materials -- but we suddenly realized that it 's impossible .
The fuel fuel is going to go up with the fuel fuel .
It 's a long time for UNK food .
What we 're trying to do today is how we can be able to share about 70 billion people in the future , health and education .
Now , there 's a little bit of technology that isn 't going to be done .
Who is going to be able to figure out that this is actually a technology for the green revolution ? Don 't think about it ? Don 't think of it ?
Why ? Don 't think about it ?
They are entrepreneurs . They 're UNK themselves .
For years ago , many years ago , I saw an interesting article in the last few years .
In the ' 60s , there 's a lot of people who are invited to talk about the future of New York City .
That 's UNK years , and they 've been in the New York City , and they were talking about 10 years ago : 100 years later , New York City doesn 't really exist .
Why ? Because they look at the map , and if we go up in the long term , it 's going to take about six million pounds , and 60 percent of it is going to be UNK .
It 's going to be UNK .
So , in 1960 , they thought , " I think , there 's a lot of technology that is going to be in New York City . "
Well , in the last 10 years , there are 11 million people in the United States , which is one of the countries in the United States : there are UNK countries .
It 's a bit of a new technology that we 've been developing , and it 's been a lot like that , and it 's a lot of small factories .
So , for example , there is a public health company in UNK UNK .
Yet , there 's a secret to the business .
First , you have to give them the promise of protecting them .
That 's not what they 're going to do .
And then you need to be focused on what they want to be .
You 've got to tell them about the real spirit of creativity .
It 's not a great business , it 's also a company , it 's going to be good for three things , and the product is much better , and the market is effective , and it 's effective .
So , what is the problem ?
There 's never a human being done as well as well , and it 's going to be a good business and a business business .
That doesn 't exist .
That 's probably not happening .
We 've been working on 100 companies in the world for 100 companies in the world , there 's a company company , there 's a company company , and all these new businesses , Google , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK
All of these businesses in the world in the world has only a common point , and one of them is one of a company that was designed by one person .
The two pages that we saw in UNK UNK in UNK , which we 've started using many other words : " The words " is " and " I 've " " That 's a word .
" I didn 't say , " I 've spent about three years .
He was just a little bit of a gun .
Nobody had to create a business . No .
So we need to create a community , and we 've got UNK UNK , and we can ask ourselves , " Well , we can ask you the help , and you 're going to ask you , " What are you need to do ?
What are you going to do ? What do you want to produce ?
Are you going to sell the money ? Are you going to make sure money ? "
" Ah , I don 't think , " What 's I going to do you to do ? "
We 've taken all kinds of communities into the community .
We 've been able to help create resources and help , and we 've found out that there 's a fantastic culture of culture that is able to change the culture of the community and the economy , and it 's just as good as we can , and it 's going to be good for you , and that 's because of the power of people .
Thank you .
Before five years ago , I had one more than a time called UNK UNK .
And also , in California , the University of UNK , the teacher of the teacher of the teacher , the students who worked in the workplace .
I was shocked .
I was frightened , and these kids in the brain , and they 've had a lot of fun , and they 've been able to get me back up in the same way that they had .
But then , again , I 've been working with UNK , and I 've been seeing the UNK hole , and you see that there 's a whole new world in a new world .
That 's the reason that I 've been working with the students , because I 'd like to be surprised to them , and I hope that others are going to be able to experience the sense of the heart .
I believe that the key to the door of the door is to have a good conversation .
So to change the world , we need to be able to start with good communication with our scientists and engineers .
It 's the most important challenge we 've ever learned , because if we don 't understand it , and I believe that we have a responsibility for all of the scientists who are responsible to interact with each other .
But if our scientists and engineers are not going to be able to look at the door of their environment , we wouldn 't be great communication .
So scientists and engineers are asking , " Well , what is the technology for us ? "
I 'd like to share with you a couple of ways , and tell you how to ensure that we 're going to be able to be able to understand , " UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK UNK .
The first thing is to answer our question : What is the technology of science ?
Tell us , why all of your science are related to us .
Don 't tell me that I 've been working with cancer , and it 's important to tell you that I 've been studying the Internet , because it 's very important to recognize knowledge and treatment .
The other way you describe science is that you need to look at the science of language .
So , we understand that we 're going to want to do something about that .
And of course , you can say , " The space , " which is a little bit of time and time . "
So , you know , it 's easy to understand , it 's easy to understand , it 's not just to simplify it .
Instead , just like Einstein , it 's not easy to think of anything as possible as possible .
You don 't have to change your science theory out of your science theory .
Maybe thinking about some examples , some of the stories , and also more , and that 's what makes you happy to us .
There 's also a lot of things that you 're going to show you in the slide .
What do you think about it a little bit called UNK ?
What is it that you 've got to do with UNK or UNK ?
It 's not just like that , but it 's not just about the language of our brains , and we don 't know anything about it .
And this is a bit of a case of UNK UNK , and it turns out that there 's a lot of new structures that we have to do with UNK UNK , and even more than UNK UNK .
So , it 's a little bit easier to think of , and it 's a little bit easier , and then it 's a little bit better , and then it 's going to be a bit of a metaphor for us , and maybe allow us to think about all kinds of ideas about the content that we have .
So , these are the ideas that I think are going to help us to open up the door of the door of science and engineering in science .
So , as I 've been working with my colleagues , I 'm going to teach my attention to the students , and I 'd like to end up with a different perspective .
I 've been working with science , and you need to share your attention , and be able to tell you about what 's happening in your mind , it 's going to be better than you can understand .
So , scientists and engineers , when you 've solved the way , then you think about the technology , which is , of course , technology .
Thank you .
My favorite word " UNK , " " UNK , " " UNK UNK . "
It 's not because it 's nice .
And it 's interesting , " A UNK . "
The reason why this is the story of a UNK century : " UNK , " he 's going to be UNK , " no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK UNK . "
I don 't understand , " UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK . "
It 's about to talk about the words of language .
But language is important to the political center of politics , and all of the politicians , they have to try to control their language .
So , for example , it 's been a long time in the U.K. of England , and it 's going to allow the story of the news newspaper .
And in fact , it 's because of a secret person , and this is a great name for UNK UNK , which is a great proposition .
He 's been killed by the London , but he 's still a great honor of UNK , and then he 's up there and then he won a lot of money in London .
And just a few years later , we had the first record , " UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK .
A lot of people think about what is called a " UNK . "
No , it 's a UNK UNK .
But to start with politics and politics , I 'd like to take you back to the last U.S. , and I want to tell you about the United States , which is just published .
And then they had a question , which was , of course , George UNK , who was a leader .
They don 't know .
Is it as a leader of a country and international leaders ?
The problem is that it 's a long time for a long time .
And there are lots of advice , and it 's kind of like this .
I mean , a few of people called UNK UNK , and some of the people called UNK UNK , and he 's called UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK .
There was no one that was UNK .
Some people just want to call him UNK .
They thought that it was done past and over again .
They don 't even have to be UNK , and they will be the only way you can be a UNK .
You know , it 's probably going to be possible .
And every human being UNK , it 's okay , because it 's a debate that 's in the debate for three weeks .
I 've read a lot about the UNK of the Jews , and there 's the record , " I think , " That 's the topic . "
And it 's the reason that it 's because there 's no reason as well , because there 's a report of war .
UNK don 't want to be in the power of Washington .
They don 't want to say that he 's going to save about one or another .
So they 've got to come up with him , and they 'll be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be high , and , most of the most UNK , the worst UNK .
And this is called " UNK . "
So , they didn 't create a UNK , and I mean , " I mean , it 's all about the front page , but it 's a member of the meeting .
It 's similar to the UNK .
And it 's not very obvious , " UNK , " " UNK , " " UNK . "
Although there 's a little bit of a little bit of a bunch of people who are going to be a bit of UNK , and there 's a political theory , but it 's not a UNK .
And that 's why it comes back to the stage .
They say , " You know , this is really cool , you can 't call him UNK .
That guy 's going to go to the bus and to meet UNK .
Who will still be able to look at him , and if he 's just like , " Well , there 's a stupid number of UNK UNK , " which is , " How is it UNK ? "
After three weeks of arguments , there 's no UNK .
So , as they said , well , there 's a lot of people who are talking about the UNK , which is not the case of the French UNK , which is a little bit of a UNK , and it 's not that it 's dangerous , and it 's not just that it 's dangerous , and we don 't want to be able to be a little bit of a little bit like a little bit of a little bit like a little bit like a little bit .
And you can learn something about three interesting things in this story .
First of all , it 's my favorite place , and it 's a place where I 've got to find out all of the projects that I 've ever been looking for in the last few years .
UNK UNK , " The UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK .
The second thing you have to do is to say that the American government says that it 's just a long time -- it 's going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going up .
But the third thing you 've learned is , well , it 's very important , and it 's a very important thing for us to go through , and that is , of course , the U.S. Department of UNK UNK . Right ?
It 's probably more than 5,000 watts of UNK UNK , and there 's a huge economy in the world , and there 's also a whole bunch of civil war and other military forces .
Now , there 's also a huge amount of UNK .
So , back to the camp .
They got their heads for them .
And then , the other thing about the church -- oh , it 's kind of weird -- oh , it 's kind of weird , and it 's kind of weird .
But now , you know , how many of these countries have the president ?
UNK .
That 's because they want to be listening to the house , which is 500 of the UNK , etc . , etc .
So by the end of the year , there 's UNK UNK , because no one 's going to feel the difference , and they 're told that they 're now UNK to the UNK government .
And it 's a very important lesson that I think you can learn , and I want to give you all of it .
The politicians choose to be able to use words and control and control , but in fact , it 's actually changed the way that we can change the words that we can change the way we can change the reality .
Thank you very much .
I was in the UNK UNK UNK UNK , and I was 19 years old , and UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK .
I 've been in my black UNK , and I 've been able to tell you about the UNK of UNK , which is a rocket UNK , and it 's a rocket UNK .
That 's the first time I got to Afghanistan .
The first time that I 've been working in the war in the war is a long time to think about religion -- " UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK " and " UNK , " and then he didn 't even know what it means like , " UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK .
But that 's what I had to do .
So I 'm standing here today , of course , the blood vessels , which is a religious artist and a politician , and I 've been working there for the last two years , and I 've been working for Afghanistan .
It 's a lot of good things that you can do in the arts , because you can actually start to be able to tell you about what you 're going to have to do with the challenge , which is , of course , the UNK of UNK UNK , and even in a case of UNK theories , even though we live a world .
I 'd like to tell you about UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK .
The war in which the war had to go up with the public elections , and I said , " I 'm a UNK , I 'm a UNK , " I 'm a UNK , " What ? "
I 'm going to try to start with the people who are going to be able to understand the black players , and they 're also a hero of the British .
I 'd like to give you a little bit of a UNK in the streets of UNK Street , and just to give them a call , or the name of the police police , or the name of the police police .
I 'd like to know that I 'd like to start with my perspective about Afghanistan in Afghanistan , and it became a conflict of conflict .
The war between war and UNK , which is the natural environment , which is the equivalent of the UNK UNK UNK , which is the equivalent of the UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK .
And I 'd like to look at the wall with UNK UNK and UNK UNK , which is called " UNK , " " UNK , " " UNK , " and " UNK , " and " UNK , " and " UNK , " and " UNK . "
But you may be able to go into the prison , and you can go back in jail .
But I had to do what I had to do , because my own self was to ask me to do it .
That 's what I 'm going to be worried about .
Thank you .
Hey , I 'm UNK UNK , and I 'm a model for a while .
Actually , 100 years ago .
Now , I feel a little bit uncomfortable for this room , because I don 't have to go through this .
So , fortunately , I brought another copy of them .
Here 's the first time on the TED stage , which I think is really lucky to be lucky now .
If there 's a few of these women who have to tell me , " I 'm going to know what I 'm going to know about UNK . "
I 'd like to tell you that I 'm lucky enough to change in 10 seconds , and I 'm going to show you what I want to do .
That 's not what everybody can do .
It 's very uncomfortable for me , because there 's no good news , which is I 'm not going to be wearing them .
The worst news I 'm going to go through is because you 're going to be smiling , and I 'm not going to do anything on my clothes .
It 's possible .
So , why do I do this ?
That 's a little bit .
I don 't think it 's going to look like this .
It 's very powerful , and it 's also UNK .
I 'm just going to change myself in six seconds , and that 's what 's going on inside of your heart .
And in this picture , I actually had no friends in real life .
And when the photographer came up to me , I was very proud of this guy .
So , by the way that we 've been working on , or two days ago , we actually had no idea of what we 've done , and we 've been UNK , which is a huge impact of our lives .
So today , I 'm sorry , of course , to be honest .
I 'm standing here today , because I 'm a model .
I was in this stage because I was a beautiful white woman , and we call it " UNK . "
And I 'd like to answer to you that the questions that we 'd often ask was a little bit differently .
The first question is , how did you become a model ?
I 'm always saying , " I 'm UNK , but , " I 'm saying , " That 's not true .
I became the real reason for that , because I have a fantastic gene , and I 'm a UNK , and you might be wondering what was going on .
Well , in the last few years , it 's not only just like healthy , young and UNK , which we 've done in life , and we 've got UNK , and there 's UNK , and there 's a little bit of UNK , and there 's a little bit of UNK , white , white , white skin .
So , that 's my product , and that 's what I 've been talking about .
I know some of you may be able to be able to tell you a little bit about some time you might be able to be able to give you a little bit about the human body , which is , of course , UNK , UNK .
First of all , I 'd like to tell you a little bit about what is happening in the brain .
But unfortunately , I 'm going to tell you about , in 2007 , in 2007 , in the ' 60s , there was one third of three , seven , seven , seven , seven , seven , seven of them .
The question is , " How is it that I grew up ? "
My first answer is , " I don 't know , because they don 't let me . "
But the second answer is , what I want to ask is , " Why ? "
You know ? You can choose anything .
You can also become the president of the United States , or the next generation of the Internet , or the UNK UNK , which is a good thing , because you 're the first one .
If I don 't say , " No , no , UNK , I 'd like to say , " I 'm like , " My wife . "
Because I 'm not going to decide anything you could , or UNK , or UNK , or UNK UNK , or UNK UNK .
When you grow up , it 's like you say , " You just like to win a little bit . "
In fact , there 's no such thing as well , and it 's fantastic , but it 's a fantastic industry .
I 'm going to show you some of the experiments that I 've been working on for decades , because it 's just like a UNK .
So , if you look at the light of the road , and you go up here , and you go up here , and you go back , and you go back , and you go back , and you go back in your head for you , for 40 , 40 , 40 , 40 .
It looks like this .
It 's not like that , because it 's just like that .
I don 't know how this was going back .
So , in fact , you 've got a little bit of a long time , and you can 't tell you a few of these projects that you 'd like to become president in the United States , but you 'd like to write on your own experience -- there are people who are going to be watching you .
The question is , " Are they going to do this ? "
Yes , they 're going to be doing all the little bits , but that 's just a little bit of a work .
So , this is a picture of me , which is the first time I 've ever been to the moon , and I didn 't even go through the moon .
I know that 's private , but I 'm very young .
So , this is a picture of a picture from my grandmother a few months ago .
This is a picture of a day .
I 'm friends talking to me .
So , this is a picture of a few days ago , a few days ago .
So , this is a picture of me working in the football team .
That 's where I 'm .
I want you to understand that these are not my own images .
It 's a picture of a group of scientists , the engineers , the designer , the designer and the engineers , and they 've gone up and they create these images , and they don 't come up with these images , rather than me .
The question is , " Are you getting free ? "
I really had so many of the time you 're going to wear shoes , but free things , and that 's where I 'm living in real life , and that 's what we don 't want to talk about .
I grew up in Cambridge City for a while , and I had no money , and they sent me a pair of UNK .
And in the last few years , I went to the car , and she was a bad driver , and we were UNK , and I was like , " The UNK , " " UNK , " " UNK UNK . "
I 've got to say , because I don 't have a identity , but some of them have to pay the price of their own .
I live in New York , and it 's 40 years old , and it 's eight percent of the population , and the percentage of the men and the men who are young boys are young boys .
But in New York , there was about 70 million black men in New York , and that 's not the case : " I 'm going to be UNK . "
" I 'm going to be stopped , " What 's going to be beaten ? "
What I 've been working on here is a population of about 35 percent of the population of women in America , and it 's about 70 years old , and it 's eight years old , and it 's eight years old .
So , the question is , " What is the feeling of nature ? "
I guess that 's the answer to that , " If you look at a little bit better here , you 're going to be happy , and you 're not easy to believe . "
And when we go up there , we 're going to give you an example of this .
We 're saying , " I 've got UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK UNK . "
It 's not , but it 's just a matter of fact , because we 're never going to say , " I 'm never going to say , " I don 't have UNK . "
Because I had to worry about it every day .
And if you ever thought , if I 'd be better , okay , I will be happier ?
You just want to look at them because they have the highest legs , the beautiful hair , and they may be the most respected woman in the world .
So , it 's really hard to think that when I 'm standing there , I think , " Look , there 's a great deal in my life , " which is , " I mean , it 's not going to be like , " I 'm sorry . "
But the hardest thing is to look at the UNK of UNK and UNK , because I 'm the greatest victims of the future .
But at the same time , I 've been working on 100 years , and it 's not the case of 20 or 30 years , but I 'm going to tell you about the first time that I 'm going to go to the first work , which is to be more important than that .
If it 's going to be good for you , I hope that we can all be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to understand what we 're seeing , and what we understand .
Thank you .
I 'm just going to ask a little bit about this .
Don 't say I 'm normal .
I 'd like to introduce you to my two brothers .
UNK : 21 years old .
He 's not going to talk about it , but it 's also a bit of fun for all of the ways , but it 's the best way you can do it .
UNK knows what it is .
He 's not allowed to share his own love with his name .
He doesn 't care , he doesn 't care about anything .
He had no UNK of religious religion , and he never talked about it .
And when he sang the song of my son 's singing , he reminded me to remember what I 'd like to be a little bit about , and , of course , a little bit about what 's going on there , which is that we don 't know .
UNK UNK : UNK UNK . It was UNK UNK .
He had the memory memory .
But that memory is a choice .
He didn 't remember my chocolate , of course , he had four years old , and he was four years old , and she was at the first time in my hand , and there was UNK UNK on my arm .
Isn 't that fantastic ?
But a lot of people don 't think about it .
Well , it turns out , because they 're very , very close to the social , and they 're very isolated and they 're UNK .
But the way that I 'm sure that we 're not going to be able to look at the same time , because there are some of these things that are extraordinary about autism , but it 's not .
And some of you may not be familiar with UNK , which is , of course , a complex social disorder , which is highly effective .
And each of the cases is special in the case , which is different from UNK .
In the world , every 20 minutes , there is one of the new diseases that we have in the world , which is the fastest disease in the world , but we don 't know how much it is that we have to fix the disease and the treatment .
I don 't remember the word " Jeopardy , " which I don 't remember , of course , " UNK . "
When I was three years old , my brother came out , and I had a new family .
And after a few months , I realized he 's different .
He 's very popular .
He 's not willing to look like that , and he 's like , " I 'm not interested in doing anything . "
UNK UNK on his world , and he 's looking at the fun of the details , and he looked at the bathroom , and he looked at the washing machine , and he was eating all the things that he was eating .
And when he grew up , he 's even more unique , and more specific than that .
So , by the way , it 's just a bit of a long time , and it 's just a bit different , and it 's just a bit of a long day , a little bit of UNK , no matter of looking at the world , and he 's a man who 's not .
That 's not easy .
I can 't tell you one of the things that I 'd like to do , and that 's a little bit harder for me .
But I thought , I thought , well , I think about what they taught me about , and traffic and UNK that I realized that these things that I don 't want to go forward .
" You know , " often , " which means that difference about the difference between Americans and human differences , it 's wrong .
It 's just different kinds of kinds of kinds of kinds of kinds of kinds .
I just want to say one word , which is , of course , UNK , for example , to tell you , " That 's normal . "
You can be very famous .
Whether it 's not that we have to be alone , we all have come across all kinds of UNK , " and " Yes , " and " UNK , " and " UNK , " and " UNK . "
And then , there 's a huge amount of progress , progress and change that we think about as well .
Don 't say , " Yes . "
Thank you .
So , for example , this is a picture of the UNK UNK , which is , of course , a little bit of a second time , a little bit of a second time .
But in the last 50 years , it 's not just a million times , and it 's not just one percent , or 100 percent a second .
Now , I 'm going to show you a new picture , which is called UNK , which is very quick , and it 's going to be able to be able to catch up the speed of light .
So , in this technology , we can actually be able to see the camera , and you can see that it 's not going to be able to look at the wild , or you can look at our bodies , and there 's a crisis that we 're trying to do .
It 's a little bit like -- I 'm going to start doing a little bit of light -- and I 'm going to just give you a little bit of light , and you 've got a little bit of UNK , and you can look at the speed , and then you can go up a little bit , and then you can go up a little bit faster , and then you can go up a little bit faster .
Now , if you put all the glass , these lights are going to go into this bottle , and these lights are going to go into the glass ?
So , what 's going on ?
Now , the whole thing ...
Now remember , this whole thing is actually happening -- it 's just a bit of time -- but now I 'm going to move a little bit of a little bit more like you can see how fast it is .
But it 's not the experience of the experience of the experience .
Now , there are a lot of things happening here , so that makes me an example .
Now , light up , and that 's our nose , through the glass , and the inside of the inside .
Some light comes out , and you go up and you start looking at these waves .
A lot of light goes up and goes up and down to the next four weeks .
You can see , here 's a vacuum bubble , and it 's UNK .
And at the same time , the waves are coming back in the table , and you can look at the bottom of the top , you can see the bottom line on the bottom , and then , again , UNK up .
Now , if you look at the same way through the same way , it 's a million times , and it 's a million times you know , you know , how long you think you need to be waiting for more years ?
One day , one week ? In fact , it 's a year .
That 's certainly a bit slow , and it 's going to be video of UNK .
But how did it look like ?
And you can see that the UNK is in the table , and the background is UNK and walls .
It 's like a rock in the water .
I think , it 's natural , if you like , a UNK , a second , but , of course , of course , we 're seeing the same structure .
But if you look at the red red here , you 're going to look at , and it 's going to go up there , and it 's going to be dark , and it 's no longer dark .
Why ? Because it 's fantastic , and it 's also UNK up inside , and it 's going back in a few hundred billion .
So , in the future , you go into the future , and you can go to the supermarket , you don 't have to look at the water , and you don 't even have to be able to see if there 's nothing .
So , what is the team that I 'm working at MIT , where is , how is it going to do that ?
Now , you know , if you think about short , you just have a little bit of light , but we need to be able to go up faster than the first time , and you 've never seen anything .
So , we 've done , and we 've been able to take these light up , and we can go through all of these things , and then you go through the data , and you go through the number of data , and you see , " UNK , " which is a picture , which is a picture you 've seen .
And we put all of the data into the data , and it 's interesting about it .
Now , UNK .
Some of his heroes are UNK , but I think , imagine what 's going on here , he 's going to be looking at something else .
So , really , we can put some light up into the door .
So these lights are going to go into the room , get back back into the door , and then go into the camera , and then we can use these light bulbs .
That 's not science . We really did it .
On the left you 're seeing a camera like this .
And in the walls , there 's a human model , and we 're going to go up a little bit .
So , in our words , after we 've been in " The natural UNK , " it 's UNK , and then they 've created this painting .
And it 's going to be able to break up the wall , and it 's going to move through the wall , and then it 's going to go back a little bit of light , and then it turns up to be able to go back into the camera , but the most interesting thing is , they 're going to go up and forth at the same time .
And because we have a chance of doing that , and then we can go up a little bit of a long camera , and that 's where we have a little bit of a camera , and it 's got a specific amount of energy .
It 's good enough time , and it 's going to be able to light up the world .
So , we don 't really know about the activity of the door , which we don 't know about the distance , but we don 't even know where it 's going to be .
So , as you can remember , it 's a lot of pictures , but it 's a lot of pictures , and there 's a lot of pictures , and then we can look at the light of the light , and we can look at the light of the light , and we can see , well , we can see , okay , we can see that there 's a living object here ?
Are we going to look at it ?
So , that 's our model . UNK .
And in the future , we 're going to be able to go through the car , and we can look at UNK , and we can look at the light of the window , or we can do that , or we can go through the window , and we can look at UNK , and you can see , in the body , we can even look at the heart , and we can even look at the heart .
But of course , since all of these organizations and the blood vessels , it 's really hard to look at the science , and it 's really important to look like this technology , and it 's also a new model of a health problem .
In science , and I think about science , and it 's also a lot of things that we 're going through , and we 've seen these UNK , and we look at these waves , and remember , it 's just a few billion times a little bit like this .
But there are some interesting things happening .
And when you look at these panels , they 're leaving us .
But they need to move forward .
What happened ?
And it turns out , because we 've been able to look at things like this , and we have some strange phenomena , because there 's a lot of love to see these images .
It 's been UNK up in the machine , and it 's a bit of a metaphor of time and space and space , and we can fix that .
So , as you can look at the scale , and we 've been able to look at all of the data , and we all want to look at our own data , and we need to look like this , and we 're going to start thinking about UNK , and we can tell us that we shouldn 't be able to look at another level of technology -- and then it 's also starting to look at the other level of the brain .
It 's different . Thank you .
This is my place where I live , Kenya , where the South Bronx park in New York .
My father , my father , was in the milk of my grandmother , UNK Park .
The South Bronx of New York City has not had the same area , and that means that the wildlife animals are moving through the park .
So , like lions , it 's going to look like them , and that 's what they 're doing .
They killed our homes .
That 's one of my grandmother that 's been killed in the evening , when I wake up , my heart UNK , because it 's one of my heroes .
We believe that we have the ability to look at our animals and our homes , and then live life , and that 's why we care about it .
So I 'm going to have to be very shy of UNK .
UNK are lawyers that they protect our families and our AIDS , but they 're very shy to the problem .
So they decide to kill these lions .
This is one of the six lions that we 've got in UNK Park .
I think it 's a rare reason for UNK Park .
After our family , we have the boys who are sitting in the age of nine years old , and the boys in which they were born , and they were born in me .
So I had to find a way to get a solution .
I think the first way I thought about fire , because I know that lions are afraid of fire .
But I realized that it wasn 't going to be able to do that , and then he helped him saw that we had the UNK .
But I wasn 't there , and I couldn 't .
So , there 's a second solution : UNK .
I 'd like to look at UNK UNK , and I 'm standing there for you .
But lions are smart .
The first day , they go back , and they go back , but the next day , they 'd come back and say , " Here 's nothing , he 's been waiting for this . "
So they go up and they die .
So , one night , I took my hand up and I was walking around the UNK , and then there was nothing like that , and then there was no one .
I started to realize that lions are afraid of animals .
So I 've got a major idea .
Because I was a young boy , and I was able to get seven of these cars in front of my house , and then she killed me , and then I learned a lot about television .
So I found a long car in the car , and it 's a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a car that comes up with UNK , and it 's going to be able to look at the light of the window .
And then I found a little bit about it , and it 's going to be able to look at the light of light .
The light bulb is a little bit of a UNK .
Everything is ready .
So , as you can see , there 's a lot of electricity in the Sun , and it 's going to be able to give you the cell phone , and I call this " UNK UNK . "
So , it 's going to move through the light of the light .
You can see , the light bulb is UNK , because the lion is coming from there .
When you go up close up there , it 's like this .
And the light light is just going to get the lion , and it 's going to be moving around , but actually , that 's where I 'm in my bed for UNK UNK .
Thank you .
I 've taken this device up in two years , and it 's a little bit worse than we can eat .
I 've heard a little bit about my neighborhood .
One of them is this old grandmother .
She 's got a whole bunch of kids who are caught up here , and she 's like , " I 'm going to ask if you can help her in your home . "
I 'm optimistic .
I 've been able to see the light , and you can see it in the back , and you can see .
In fact , I 've been working in the village of the village in the family community , and it 's very useful .
Now , I 've been able to be able to put up all of these guys in Kenya , just like dogs , just like dogs , for example , and they 're used to be used to be able to be able to look like that .
I 've been lucky enough that , because there 's a great example of UNK , which is the great school school -- UNK UNK , which I 'm very excited about .
My new school now is going to go up here and help me find more money and more money .
I even put my family back into my community , helping them to teach them how to teach them .
A year ago , I was just a UNK boy who was waiting for the UNK , and I looked at the plane , and he said , " I 'm going to tell you one day , I will be here .
And today , I did .
I got the opportunity for the airport , and this is my first time .
So my great dream is : When I grew up , it 's a pilot engineer .
I 've talked about lions , but now , that 's because my invention is saved by my dad , and , of course , we 're going to die of lions and peace .
Thank you very much . I mean , it 's very , very much .
UNK UNK : You don 't believe , and you 've heard about your story , which is a bit more exciting .
So you 've got this award , UNK UNK : Yes .
Are you alone with another movie ?
What 's next ?
RB : My next invention is , I want to make a call , UNK ?
RB : I know that , but I thought , well , but I just wanted to do my own self .
Now you 've been a little bit too far up , but you 've been -- of course , " I 've never tried that before , " I 've stopped , but I 've forgotten , because it 's shocked me .
It 's a war . UNK , you 're different than you .
We 're going to drink each other steps you 're going to go through .
Thank you very much . Thank you .
I live in Los Angeles .
This is UNK UNK : UNK , UNK , UNK .
So , they 're talking about the UNK of the New York Times , so they changed it into the South Los Angeles , which is kind of like trying to figure out what it 's like to solve this city .
This is UNK UNK .
The hotel shop , the restaurant shop , the land of the land .
It 's about 50 million Americans in food , and I live in the South Pole , which is going to go up , and it 's going to be faster than the cars , or the cars .
So , there are some interesting things that are going to be going to die .
In Los Angeles , people died of diseases .
For example , the obesity rate that we live in the streets are much less than 50 times a day , maybe 80 times .
I hate these things .
And I 'm thinking , if there 's not to be a healthy food , you 've come out of your relationship with food systems of food systems that you have in your community system , which is , what is your feeling ?
I 've seen a little bit like a UNK .
I see that there 's a lot more like UNK on Mars .
I don 't think it 's going to go again .
I think the answer is something that has been hidden .
The food is problem , food is the solution .
Again , I 'm tired of UNK , and it 's about 45 minutes later that 's going to be able to buy a apple apple .
So , what I did , I was in my house .
It 's called the green lanes of the park .
The 15 feet is 100 feet tall .
The green is all about the government .
But there 's always a human being .
So I thought , " That 's great ! That 's my responsibility , and I need to protect it , so what I 'd like to do is to do what I can do . "
That 's why I want to protect it .
So I was working with my team , " Los Angeles , " and we 're moving into the food forest , and the trees , there is a whole lot of food .
We are a selfish organization , which is different from the different cities , and all of us are volunteers , and all of us are UNK .
It 's beautiful . It 's very beautiful .
But there 's been a bit of fun .
The government tells me that I had to go back through my garden , and I had to go back to the police .
I thought , " Why , what 's it ?
Is it a little bit of food in a little bit of food ?
And I thought , " Well , let 's look at it . "
Because there 's nothing happening .
So , UNK UNK wrote a story about his story , and a green group of people who are going to go to the book , and it 's about 90 UNK , and we 've succeeded , and we succeeded .
We have to succeed with our hands .
They even go back to the interview , and he had a lot of fun and passionate about it .
I mean , of course , why don 't we do that ?
In the Los Angeles , there was a huge amount of land in the United States .
It 's got UNK miles of space .
That was a central park park .
There are lots of spaces of space to go up there , and we can grow up to 70 million miles of UNK .
Why did they feel like this ?
There are hundreds of trees that could go up to 100 , and even a million seeds .
A dollar of green can also be 75 dollars for you .
So , this is my belief , and I tell people , of course , your food .
It 's almost like a food . It 's kind of like UNK .
See , in Los Angeles , I have a UNK .
I grew up in there , and I 'm saving my son .
I 'm not allowed to be part of being able to create a reality that I want to create , and I want to create myself .
See , I 'm a artist .
The studio is my UNK , and I create my own art .
It 's like UNK artists , and I 'm , like , UNK , green .
I 'm going to go through the garden and the land , and the plants and the trees , and the trees are what I was doing .
You may be surprised to be able to make sure , and if you put it into your paintings .
You can 't imagine much more magical , and it 's going to affect the impact of humanity .
What 's going to happen to happen ?
I 've been seeing my garden for education , and it becomes a tool for my community .
In order to change the community , you have to change the size of the soil .
That 's where we are .
You 're going to be surprised by kids .
UNK is the most good activity of living health , and the challenge of war , especially by the activity of the activity in the city .
Again , you can also get UNK .
I remember one of the mom and girls , and girls in about 10 o 'clock in front of the night , and when I came to see them , they were very difficult .
They 've been very bad , and I tell them , you don 't need to eat anything like this .
This is the reason for the restaurant .
When I see people in the middle of my body , I thought , " I 'm sorry , why don 't you want to eat your food ? "
And I said , " I 'm sorry , I 'm not afraid of you .
And that 's why it 's going on the streets .
That 's what I want .
I want people to go back , but also , I hope that people will be part of the healthy body . "
I also had one of the UNK that I was working on in Los Angeles .
These guys helped me get money .
It 's very , very cool about how they make them so much , and how they interact with their mothers , and they can change them , and they can change things , and they 're just fantastic things , and it 's just like this .
The green group has come up . It 's probably 20 billion kilometers .
We 've had about 50 people involved in our team , and they 're all volunteers .
If you 're going to be able to get blue blue , kids will eat blue .
If they were UNK , they would eat .
But there 's nothing more like that , if they don 't have to eat the food as the human imagination , they 're just trying to eat anything like the food that they 've ever seen .
And they 'd like to work very well , and I 've been very optimistic about that , and they 're constantly trying to walk through other people , and they 're going to go through them , and then they don 't know about it .
And when I 've been able to do that , I 've found a chance that we can train these kids from the community , and we can train the lives of living in the community .
And we 're doing it , who knows if we don 't .
It 's a UNK UNK .
But if we don 't change the economy , we 're never going to do that .
That 's one of the projects I want to do .
I 'd like to share a whole bunch of streets around the streets .
I 'd like to make something that is going to go into the health of the health .
Don 't be wrong .
I don 't want to be free , because it 's not sustainable .
And it 's a little bit harder for you to think about it .
What I 'd like to tell you about is to get people to go away from the streets , and to get them back into the streets of living food , UNK , UNK , UNK .
So , what I 'd like to do is to think of the driver of this project .
I 'd like to start with UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK .
We need to look up with UNK .
If you don 't say , you 're not a UNK .
So , what happens when it 's got to go through , what is it like ?
So let 's make it a little bit of a weapon for you .
In fact , if you think about it , if you want to look at what 's going on , if you 're going to talk about it , there 's nothing else .
If you think about it , there 's a little bit of UNK going on here , and that 's a little bit of a little bit of thing .
Sorry , thank you .
Thank you .
Before , in October , I was a photographer , and I was the New York City of New York .
We 've got no UNK , we 're eating .
We 're going to be sitting on the black side of the sky , not the sun , but there 's no windows , and it 's about the sun .
It 's a little bit more UNK , and it 's probably going to be possible , and it 's possible for us to do that , but we 're actually going to be in the art of New York , and we 're living up the old artists , and it 's rich , and it 's a lot of fun and images .
Ten years ago , there was just one of the most young years of the world , and I saw a tragedy in Japan .
And after the long time , I 've been working on a family called UNK , which is just a few days ago , and in the next few days , it 's going to continue to save aid .
I 've been obsessed with all of the young guys who : We can 't wait for you , so I also decided to go into their projects , and I 've decided to save the aid in three weeks .
UNK , I was in Japan UNK .
That 's a small village that is UNK up there , which is about five people , and it 's a UNK area .
The last time in the UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK .
You can imagine , there 's a lot of UNK going on here .
We 've got to go through the river and the rivers and the water .
We 've been able to help schools and those who don 't have the house to go , and understand , and UNK and UNK .
We 've understood that there is a huge amount of UNK , UNK , which is a fish that is built inside of the factory , and the fish .
We 're getting tired of UNK , but we 're happy to be here .
It 's a couple of weeks , and there 's a couple of volunteers and a couple of other kinds of things .
They don 't have to be able to find images of images and UNK and UNK .
Every human response is a little bit like this .
They put these pictures together , and they put them into all the town .
And even in the past , I realize , I 've never lost these pictures , and it 's a huge part of the population .
And when they get UNK , there 's a huge amount of UNK , looking at all the things , and then all of the things that they have .
When I was in Japan , a few days ago , I found myself in a UNK center .
It helped a huge amount of UNK in a social level .
That 's a picture of the local population where people lost their lives .
People put it up to the public level , and when I was lucky enough to get to them , let me start with my hands , and maybe the pictures .
It 's a little bit of time , and it 's very exciting , and it 's very exciting to say that you 've got to understand that , until that picture , which I really did .
I 've been able to look at the experience of the last few years , and I 've been able to look at the lab in the lab , and maybe I can fix them , and I also understood a lot about the people who can actually help them understand these pictures .
So , in the days of my day , when I go to the front of the day , there 's a lot of lessons about it , and there 's a lot of feedback back there , and he 's optimistic , and I know that we need to move forward .
So we started to fix things .
So , this is a picture of the first time .
It 's not that hard to fail , but it 's UNK , and it 's UNK up there , and we had to be able to fix them , and we had to fix it , and we had to be very seriously .
Otherwise , it 's not going to look like a look at the face of her -- there 's a tragedy , there 's a little bit like that .
And then , the more exciting time , we 're going to be able to do that , and we 're going to go through the Internet , and there 's the Internet and the industry , and that 's about 80 days , and that 's about 80 UNK , and it 's about 50 of them , and it 's a bit of a home , and it 's going to be able to help them , and they come from 12 different countries .
Two weeks , I got 15 volunteers , and they 'd like to join us .
In the late ' 70s , just in Japan , we 've developed many of the most important areas that we 've got up in the last decade , and there 's a population of Bangladesh .
And each week , we 've been able to scan the inside of the museum , and people who go back to them .
Sometimes , a few years later , a few years later , she 's going to be scanned , and then you can look at the UNK UNK , or UNK UNK , and they may be able to move off the other side of the planet , which is just starting to be done .
And then , then , then , then , they had to go back all the time , and then it was different .
Maybe it 's going to be better , and maybe it 's going to be long a few weeks .
Even a month .
It 's beautiful and it 's going to be able to do that , or a little bit of UNK , or a little bit of color , and it 's a little bit of color , and it doesn 't have to be able to be able to do that .
It 's a long time .
UNK like that , there 's nothing like oil , and there 's even more like that , and there are lots of these animals , and there are lots of these pictures , and there 's a huge part of these things .
And if these images are not good enough , we 're not going to be able to fix them , and we don 't have to fix it , and we have to do that , and we need to fix them , and we don 't have to do it .
And we had a lot of money working on our hands .
And then there 's a woman who comes up with us .
And these pictures are easy for us .
So , as I said , it 's kind of like being UNK to the human being .
You don 't have any UNK , and it turns out to be bad .
That gives us a lot of girls , these pictures , these images .
She also started taking pictures of the hand , until she realized that she had to make better damage .
Okay , there 's a picture of her .
Otherwise , in the picture , she and her son , the face of her life , is a completely UNK process , and we 've been able to put all of that together to the whole lot of it , and then it turns out that this is a picture .
When she comes up to the picture , she 's going to share a story with some of these pictures .
So , it turns out that this is actually a story of my husband , and it turns out that in the UNK UNK UNK UNK , there 's a huge amount of money , and they don 't even agree with him .
And then , of course , what happened is , he 's responsible for the UNK UNK UNK .
In other words , he had to go up to the bottom line .
She 's got old son , which is a little bit old , and it 's been working in two different schools .
One of the kids in the school is UNK UNK .
She took a whole week to go back from the whole week , and then they were dead .
And we 've taken her last picture , and it 's just a little bit of a UNK birthday .
So , it 's a great reason for him to tell her , because it 's the best way to go to him , and that 's not the case for the last 10 months , and there 's a few months in his life , and it 's a long story , and it 's just destroyed .
In the days of the day , there was only one of those parents who came up in jail , and we had hundreds of millions of dollars for the first few years , and there was a huge amount of data in there , and there was a huge amount of data -- there was a huge amount of data .
Most of them go back in the blind hand , and it 's also important .
There 's millions of books that we 've been looking for in the ' 50s and the hundreds of books that have been UNK and repair .
In this period , we don 't have to be able to do that , and we 've got hundreds of dollars , and most of the time we 've done in the air .
We had to go up with us .
It 's a picture of an UNK and UNK , which is to remind us a little bit , a little bit , a little bit of fun .
It helps us remember , we remember , we 've gone , and we 've been able to look at the long time , but we go up there for the first time , and we go back to the next day .
So , that 's the part of the project , a little bit of a little bit of people , a little bit more UNK , and a little bit more connected .
And when you look at the human body , it takes a huge difference , a little bit different than the lost life .
And this is the project that we 've come up with , and we 've done a huge change .
For some of these projects , they 've created some of these connections , and it 's also a little bit more important , and it 's going to be a little bit more like that , and they don 't only be able to do that , because they don 't have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do things like that .
I 'd like to tell you a little bit of a call , and I 've got a call from UNK , which is six months later , and I was from the Japanese home for six months .
" When I 'm working on that photo , I 'm not going to think about the stories that everybody in the middle of the picture .
It 's just a little girl , and it 's a little girl , and it 's a little girl , because there 's a kind of a picture of my grandmother , my grandmother , my mother and the daughter , and this is a little girl that was born in my home room .
In the world , beyond the bottom of the world , we have some of the most basic technologies , isn 't it , isn 't it , isn 't it ? "
Thank you .
Today , I 'd like to talk about a little bit of a problem , which is a great problem .
I want to talk about family 's secret , and I 'm going to ask the question : " Why is she going to leave the violence ? "
" Why would someone want to live with a man with her boys ? "
I 'm not a religious doctor , a social job , or not a family .
I 'm just a woman who had to tell his story .
I was 22 years old .
I moved to New York , and I moved to the first time , " UNK , " " UNK , " " UNK , " " UNK . "
So , the first one , I had my own house . I had a great secret .
The secret is that I thought , well , that I thought , " I 'm living for the men in my soul , " for the long time , for me , too much too much . "
So this is my favorite guy , and I 've forgotten that I 've never remember anything that I 've ever had to do .
Now , what I 'd like to tell you about this is a story of " UNK , " which is going to be millions of women , even more women .
And maybe , it 's happening in your body .
I don 't look like the typical family violence .
I had the British UNK , and I was able to go to the city of UNK UNK UNK UNK .
I 've been working up for most of you in the UNK industry , including UNK UNK and UNK UNK .
My first husband was more than 20 years old .
I took one of the black UNK , and we had UNK UNK .
That 's what I want to tell you about , whether or family , there may be nothing you can 't be talking about , or UNK or education .
It 's going to be visible .
I want to talk about the second thing , which is that there 's a lot of people who are responsible for family violence , which is to be a woman 's question .
No .
UNK percent of the family 's disease , and it 's a lot of UNK , and it 's a place where we don 't want to go , or I want to go into the violence .
I 've only got one of these people in the world , and I 'm just waiting for a man , but in fact , it 's very common for me to look at the age of this year .
When I was 12 years old , I was getting older in the United States in America , and it was about 50 years of violence in the United States , and girls were killed by the women , and girls are killed by their boys , or husband .
I 'm a very typical victim , and it 's because of my family violence and development model .
I met UNK , and there was a month , and it was very cold .
We 're sitting in New York City , and he 's talking to me .
He tells me two things .
The first is that he had been working with UNK UNK , and he was working with UNK UNK .
But then the first time that I left up to me was that his wisdom and humor , and the other way he looked like a farmer .
His face is like , " Well , there 's a little bit of UNK out there , and it looks a lot of people . "
One of the smartest things that I 've been working on in the last few years , and I believe that , in that sense , I 'm a powerful part of this .
When I first started , I thought , " I 'm a UNK for him . "
We started talking about things about my own , and , for example , my smart , and I 'm going to be young girls , and I 'm going to help , and my work .
He 's willing to understand my family , my childhood , my wish and dream .
UNK for me , I 'm a woman and a woman who had never been told , " Never never before . "
So , by the way that we 've been able to do that , and he 's going to be very good at the end of the body , because it 's very good for the long time , because it doesn 't have to go to school because of the time when he 's eight years old . He had spent about 20 years he had to build his life up .
That 's why , of course , the University of UNK , the New York Times , and the future of the future .
If there was a day , I had a day , and I had a day , and I was living , and I was able to start doing anything , and I would laugh , and I 'd like to go , because I don 't have a bit of UNK or UNK or anything like that .
And when I didn 't know , it was the first time that I had to be a little bit of UNK and UNK .
And I don 't know , of course , the second step is a victim .
I 'm going to tell you about my own apartment , and you 're going to tell you about your own UNK , which I 'd like to tell you about your friend , your family , your family and your colleagues , and the city is not going to be seeing you . "
In fact , when he comes home , he told me that he had to go out of the city , and he 'd never had to go to the city , and he wanted to go up with the city , and then he was very popular , and then he was in the middle of New England , and I grew up in New England , and I had to go into new lives for New England .
Well , I didn 't want to leave New York in New York , and I thought I needed to cook , so I thought , " I thought , " I thought , " I thought , " I thought , " I thought , " I thought , " I thought , " I thought , " I thought , " I thought , " I thought , " I thought , " I thought , " I thought , " I thought , " I thought , " I thought , " I thought , " I thought , " I thought , " I thought , " I thought , " I thought , " I thought , " I thought , " I thought , " I thought , " I thought , " I thought , " I thought , " I thought , " I thought , " I thought , " I thought , " I thought , " I thought , " I thought , " I thought , " I thought , " I thought , " I thought , " I thought , " I thought , " I
I 've been fascinated by crazy love , and I don 't even know that I 've been able to understand that I 've been able to understand , and , of course , the ability to control your body , heart and the economy .
The third phase of violence is to start with violence .
So , here 's the way I made it .
We just moved to New England City -- and I thought , " Well , there 's a security there , " he 's bought three guns .
It 's in the car . It 's in the car .
It 's in the bed of the bed , and the third is to put up in the pocket .
He had to say that he had a little bit of UNK UNK , and he had to have these guns .
It makes him security .
The gun , I thought , was a clear signal , and he wasn 't there , and then I wasn 't going to be in danger .
The first time I was in my wedding about five days ago .
That was in the morning seven , and I was sitting in bed .
So , as I 've been working through the service of the computer , I had a little bit of UNK , and I was UNK , and then I couldn 't go , and he came up with me in the back of my neck , and then I was UNK my head .
Five days later , there was a UNK on my mom , and I was UNK up there for him .
And even though that happens , I still believe that we can be able to live because we 're happy because we 're so cute .
He 's deeply UNK .
He 's too much pressure , too much , and it 's UNK up and the home of my family .
It 's a place , and he 's not going to hurt me .
After all the time I got two .
The first time , I was going to go to the secret of the secret , and I went off , and he was , like , " UNK my head , " and then it was in the glass of my head .
And in the last few days , the road opened up the door , and it was very , very UNK , and he put it in the ice cold , and he was just in my face .
I 'm going to be a little bit of two years old , and I 'll be six years old .
I 've been wrong with one of my personal experiences .
In fact , in every three American woman , there was one of the problems of a family violence , or UNK UNK , which was 15 million children a year , 15 million years ago .
So , actually , I 'm not an example .
Come back to my question : Why am I going to leave ?
The answer is very simple .
I don 't know if he was in jail .
Despite my own dog , UNK me up , and he 's going to go up the train , because I 've never thought of myself as a child , because I 've never thought of myself as a child .
I mean , I 'm a great woman , and I 'm a great woman , and I 'm the only person in the world , and that 's the only reason for help to help .
The other question you want to ask is , why don 't you leave it ?
Why don 't I ever run out ? I have a lot of opportunities .
For me , it 's the most exciting question of fear and suffering , and you can 't understand it , but it 's just as if we 're victims of the victims .
Because the last step in violence is to kill her .
Over 70 percent of the family 's violence , there 's been a little bit of UNK out there , because there 's no such thing as well .
That 's not the case of war and her kids , and the kids are going to go up and ask them to go up and to go to the family .
Now we still ask , " Why don 't we leave ? "
And I decided to go out , because the last time I had been UNK UNK .
I realized that if I wasn 't UNK , the man that I had loved my loved was killed me .
So I quit silence .
I 'm going to ask the police , the neighbors , my friend and family , my friends , and I 'm standing here today , because every one of you 've helped me .
We tend to be the victims of the victims , and the young women , just like the news of the news .
" Why is it that she 's going to stay ? "
Some of you actually say , " This is her , " and it 's kind of like the victims of the men who are killing them .
After all these books , many men and women tell me that they 've had a long story of living , and they 're happy to be happy , and the wife and the wife and the wife , just like I live live alive , distance .
In fact , I 'm a typical family of family violence , which is typical of a typical family violence .
I 'm married with a warm man , and there 's three kids .
I took one of the black UNK , and we had UNK UNK .
And I will never be able to ask , because there 's always a mouth behind my person , and it 's just like my hand to go through my head .
And so , you might think , wow , this is fantastic , or , " Oh , she 's stupid , " but in the process process , I 'm talking about you .
I promise , and now I 've been listening to some of the people who have been raped or UNK , or you 're a UNK .
UNK might be born in your daughter , and your best friend of your sister .
I 'm going to end up a little bit of " UNK " , " which is called UNK .
And today I 'm still going to be quiet .
That 's the way I helped others , and that 's the last time I 'm going to ask you .
Tell you what you 're listening to today .
It 's just going to live in silence .
You have to do that , because there 's a little bit more than one of the other stars .
We have the victims of the victims to help each other .
We need all of you to learn about violence in violence .
And your kids , your colleagues , your friends and family talks about it , is going to be UNK .
It helps us to improve better and better , to be in trouble , and to be in the future .
And it turns out that there 's a budget of violence in the home of violence , which is the potential for UNK , which is responsible for the victims of the victims .
So , let 's go up again , and our bed is going to be the home of our meal and the family that they need to be safe , and flat .
Thank you .
When I was a kid , and I think one of the best things in the world is , " I 'm going to learn a song called " UNK UNK . "
I 'm very proud of that .
In schools , we 've been working in schools , but we 've never seen a lot of the world about the world , except for the U.S. , Europe and Japan .
And even though I was in the context of the outside of the world , I thought I 'd be in the middle of my life , until all things had changed .
When I was seven years old , I thought it was a little bit of my first life , but I thought I was in the middle of my life .
My family is not poor , and I 've never experienced one day in my own experience .
But in 1995 , my mom brought a letter to come from her husband 's sister .
And he says , " When you read this call , my home is going to leave the man , because we 've got two weeks to do nothing .
We 're in the floor , our bodies , our bodies , and we 're waiting for dead . "
I was very surprised .
That 's the first time I 've heard a little bit about my country .
And after that time , when I walked across a train station , I saw a really sad thing for me to forget .
One of the women 's boys who are sitting in the ground , and there 's a secret child , which is just going to be in his mom 's face .
But nobody helped them , because it 's connected to the home of your own home .
The early ' 70s , there was a huge amount of famine .
Unfortunately , over 100 percent of the population of death , and a lot of the people who live there , and there are still UNK and trees .
And it 's getting more UNK , and it 's a little bit more like in the evening , except in the middle of the China , which is just going to be through my home .
I was thinking about why they had lights , and we didn 't .
It 's a satellite map , and it 's been UNK up in the middle of the night .
This is UNK UNK , which is a part of China and UNK .
And as you can see , the river is very close to the bottom of the world , which is to go through the country and get it into China .
But there 's a lot of people who are going to die .
Sometimes I see that there 's a dead side inside of the water .
I can 't tell you that too much too much , but I 'm just going to say that that 's in the most difficult years , and I was sent to China and close to China .
I was just a short time for my family .
But I 've never thought about 14 years , and we 're getting serious .
In China , I 've done a lot of young girls .
I don 't know if one of the challenges that I was going to go through , because I 'd like to realize that life isn 't dangerous , and it 's not even dangerous , because it 's in the middle of the country , because of the war .
So I 've been living in fear , and I 'm afraid of my identity , and I 'm going to be able to go back up here , and I 'm afraid of UNK .
One day , my worst nightmare , I was sent to the police police and sent back to the police .
I mean , I 'm talking about UNK , so I 'm trying to test my UNK , and ask me a lot of questions .
I was very scared , and I was UNK by fear .
If there 's anything else , I 'm going to go back .
I 've done this for my life , and I 've been working on my fear of fear and UNK , and then answer to them .
And then , a police said to another person , " UNK is wrong .
She 's not a UNK . "
And then they put me out , and it 's a miracle .
Some of the people who are going to be in China in China to go to the UNK , but a lot of people are arrested in the country , and it 's taken back up and forth .
These girls are lucky .
Even though they were caught , but they were forced to stress , and they ended up .
But there 's a lot of people who are UNK up there .
For every year , the number of people who are UNK up the country are arrested , and then they 're UNK , or UNK , or UNK .
And even though I 'm lucky enough enough to move off , I don 't have that kind of UNK in the same way .
It 's a terrible thing , and that 's where the population itself has to be UNK , and it 's going to be a place for survival .
Even though they learn about the literature , they find jobs , and they 're in the middle of the world .
So , that 's why , after , I decided to go back to Europe , and I decided to go back to Europe , and then I went back into new life .
In Europe , there 's more difficult to be more difficult than the future than I think .
The English is very important , so I 've got to start learning about the third word , English -- English .
In addition , I realized that Europe had a huge difference between Europe and North America .
And even though we 're all UNK , but we 're very different from the end of six years .
I even experienced my own identity .
I go to the bottom of the year , where is it that we 're talking about ?
Where am I come from ? I 'm it ?
And all of a sudden , I 've never had to call one of the countries that I have in my own country .
And even though it 's not easy for Europe , but it 's not the case , but I 'm going to decide .
It 's ready to learn how to learn .
I just started to start living in just a long life , and I went to an amazing call .
UNK government led to my family 's population , and my family was forced to move around , and moved to the part of the village in rural villages .
They had to walk away , so I started to help them escape .
That 's a little bit different than the population of the population .
It 's impossible to look at the edge of the country in Europe , and it 's just impossible , and I 'm going to go into the center of the state and then go up to the edge of the world .
Because my family didn 't understand Chinese , so I had to help them in China in the last 200 kilometers in China .
We had a week for a week , a couple of weeks , a little bit of UNK .
Again , we were sitting in the UNK , one of the Chinese police .
He looked at it , and started to ask questions .
Because my family wasn 't sure , I was afraid to be caught .
So when there 's a lot of police in the country , I 'm going to stand up to tell him about that person , and I 'm a UNK .
He 's really worried about me , but fortunately , he believed me .
So , we 've been working for aging , but I 've got to look up all the way up to the streets of UNK UNK .
And even though we 've been working with this , my family is going to be dead .
After the money , I spent the money money , and my family was released up , but after a long time , they were caught up in the old days , and they were caught up .
That was one of the most common moments of my life .
I 've been given freedom , and I 've been able to go up until you go up , and you 're going to have to go up in the long time , and you 're going to have to go up the prison , and then you don 't have to go up in the same way , because there 's no longer in the jail .
I 'm going to go back into the UNK and the police , and then you go up there , and I hope you 're going to save them , but I don 't have enough money to go or buy a money or a lot of money .
I 'm optimistic .
And then , I hear one of these guys , " What ? "
I 'm a UNK , and I 'm a great stranger .
I 'm going to start with my old English language , and I 'm going to start talking about that , and that guy comes to the airport , and the guy who 's going to go to the other side of the other side is to pay for the rest of the rest of the death .
I really appreciate him , and she said , " Why are you going to help me ? "
" I 'm not trying to help you , " he said .
" I 'm helping people . "
And I realized that was a moment of my life as well .
So , the good news about that is that I need to look at the most important thing that I know , and he made me understand that the optimism and the social society are really important to us .
And then , finally , after the long time , I was working with a family in Europe because it was just a half war for war .
Lots of people and their families are dying , and when they come up with new countries , there are very few dollars , or UNK .
So we 've been able to help this help in international societies , and in New York , UNK training , UNK UNK UNK .
We can also use the relationship between the world for living in the world , because we 're very young and living in the middle of the world , and we sent back to the information where it was going to be different .
I 've been lucky , and I 've got a lot of help and UNK , so I 'd like to help that , because there 's a vision of hope that you want to be in , and you 're thinking about the future .
I 'm sure you 're going to be seeing more and more of the population in the world in the world , including this stage .
Thank you .
You might be great at the same time .
It 's a fantastic , and it 's a great material , but it 's not always , but it 's not always that way , but it 's kind of like the weather , and it 's going to be like today .
It 's a lot of water up there .
Especially if you want to go through your car , and you 're not too nice .
And at the same time , there 's a lot of noise out there .
So , there 's a little bit of material , and if we 're going to go up the city of cities , like we 're going to look at the little bit of a little bit smaller .
The way to fix it is to use lots of little UNK .
In many cases , it 's a little bit of a lot of material , and it 's a little bit of a little bit like water , and the rain is going to be easy , and it 's easy , and it 's easy to get it , and there 's no such thing as well .
The noise isn 't going to be lost in these legs .
Because it has a lot of holes , and it 's quiet noise , so it 's quiet .
And , of course , it 's a bit of a lack of UNK , and it 's a little bit of a UNK .
What 's called UNK ? Look at the stone from the road .
Well , it 's a little bit , and it 's a bit better , and then it 's more and more and more and more , and then I 'm not going to show you .
But they 're going to be bad for you , and you 're not happy .
And finally , there 's more damage to this .
Sometimes it 's going to be a little bit later .
UNK , he 's ready .
UNK are certainly a problem , but we have a solution .
And here you 're seeing the damage .
That 's UNK , just like I said , there are fewer UNK on the edge of the stone .
So by the way , of course , oxygen , oxygen , and so on , this is a little bit of a UNK , and it turns out that it 's going to be a little bit , and it 's going to be a little bit , and it 's going to be a little bit more UNK , and it 's going to be a little bit more UNK out there .
If you go on the road , you 've got these kinds of stuff -- it 's what we 're seeing .
So , to understand this , we 're thinking about UNK materials .
And if we can make the materials , then there 's probably going to be a solution .
And we 've been using the UNK of UNK , which is a little bit of UNK , and we can be able to break up a little bit of small things , and we put these little pieces of these little pieces of these little pieces .
So now there 's a little bit of a little bit of steel inside there .
You need a machine like this , which is a device -- it 's going to cook .
So , there 's a lot of things going on , and there 's a lot of fun there .
So , what we need to do is to break up the steel , and put it into the UNK , and you go into the little stone , and then you go up .
It 's very easy for me , and I 'm going to show you a little bit of UNK here .
UNK is similar to the pattern of electronic computers .
I put it up , and I 'm going to put it up here and see what happens .
That 's where it looks like .
We 've got a factory in the lab , and we have a lot of these machines .
And we 've been able to test many diversity , and we 've seen a lot of different kinds of things , and they decide , " That 's interesting , we should try . "
The government was responsible for about 40 feet , and we were able to do what we did .
That 's what we did . You see it kind of a little bit , and it 's a little bit of a few years , and it 's a little bit of a little bit of a couple of years , and it 's a little bit of a bit of a couple of years .
And we 've been doing a lot of things in this way , and we 've been able to do a lot of things in the lab .
We 've done the old experiment , and we 've added a lot of it , and we 've got to be able to put them up and put them up and test them .
And we can think of that as well .
So , in fact , this is a little bit of a little bit like this , and we 're going to move through all of these things , and we 've been able to use our way through the road , which is going to double , and , of course , if you 're going to get more money in the road , there 's a lot of money .
So , it turns out that we 've created a lot of materials with steel , and we can go up the whole lot of energy , and it 's going to save a lot of money .
You 're going to be good .
Let 's look at this . Now there 's also a little bit .
In fact , I 've got to make sure that it 's going to be more effective than you can .
But it 's going to try .
See , really , it 's okay .
Thank you .
I 'd like to talk to you about a very different animal .
There are millions of birds in the planet .
UNK is one of the most vulnerable species of them .
Whenever you look at the UNK , it 's just as if you look at the ocean , which is bad , and it 's UNK , it 's UNK , it 's UNK , it 's UNK , it 's UNK .
I 'd like to change that , and I 'd like to change the little bit of what 's going on , because they need our compassion . They really need it .
So let me tell you why .
First , why are they going to leave us all this ?
In UNK , Charles Darwin looked at UNK UNK , and he said , " You know , " These are UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK . "
You 're really hard to find a little bit more like that , and that 's , you know , Charles Darwin .
So , you know , Darwin went back to the U.K. , and I 'll tell you why you 're going to tell you why .
It 's also been UNK by UNK -- it 's like UNK , it 's UNK , it 's UNK , it 's UNK , it 's UNK .
In Kenya , it 's been UNK , and it 's like UNK UNK , but I want to call it UNK .
I want to ask you . What 's wrong with you ?
Because countries don 't want to maintain the environment .
We can 't prevent it .
It 's a little bit more like a little bit of UNK .
They had never gone up .
And then , that 's my favorite example , UNK .
There are two of these types of UNK in the world .
The Great UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK , which is about 16 of them in its continent , and there 's about one risk of risk , and there 's about one risk of extinction .
So , why is it important ? Well , first of all , it 's very important to do what 's going on , and it 's important to make a difference .
UNK is our natural UNK of our nature .
They 're going to be able to put the animals out of the meat , and it 's just a little bit of the animal .
They can prevent the bacteria in the body , and they 're able to prevent the impact of the virus from the virus that can prevent the vaccine and the animals and the animals who live out of death and disease .
And recently , I 've also shown that there are many of the areas of the area where there are lots of places that don 't have much more likely to be able to provide more opportunities for diseases like this .
There 's also a lot of history .
They 're also related to all sorts of different kinds of peace culture .
Now , there 's a culture of UNK in UNK and UNK , and it 's also UNK up there with UNK and UNK and UNK and UNK .
In India , in India , he had the risk of life , which had been saved by the UNK of UNK UNK .
In the West culture , there 's also a huge amount of UNK , there 's nothing like that , there 's no UNK , there 's no wood , there 's no fire , so it 's a natural UNK system .
So , what 's wrong with these problems ?
There are eight UNK of UNK , and there 's six of them going to be extinct .
It 's the reason why there 's a lot of UNK in Kenya , because there 's a lot of activity in the history of life , there 's a drug that is used by the drug , and the food is used by the UNK , and that 's where there 's been a victim .
In South Asia , there 's been a bit of UNK in South Africa , which is the reason why it 's going to be extinct in the last 15 years , which is because they 've been saved by the long food , which is a little bit more UNK .
There 's also a huge amount of drugs that have been used in India , which is a huge level of the government .
Because the amount of UNK , the dog 's population , there 's UNK , there 's UNK , there 's UNK , there 's UNK , there 's UNK , there 's UNK , there 's UNK , there 's about UNK diseases .
Kenya , there 's a huge risk of UNK : UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK .
I 'm not going to leave the wind , but we should be able to look at the government , because the pressure is going to be threatened by birds , and it 's going to be a UNK .
And they are just UNK .
In West Africa , there 's nothing bad about the UNK of hunger and UNK .
What do we do ? We 're learning about these things , and we 're in these instruments , in each other .
We 're trying to figure out how to look at the environment around the world , and you can understand the activity of the world .
And we 've found that they 're going to be in different countries , so if you 're just focusing on a map , you 're really hard to get into it .
We need to deal with the government in the world .
We 're trying to interact with local communities .
We 're trying to get them to understand the benefits of UNK , and then UNK UNK , and they are responsible for all of these fantastic creatures , and they are responsible for nature .
What can you do ? You could actually tell your government and you can tell them , and we need to look at these things that we need to learn about -- and there 's a lot of people who are going to tell you , and there 's a lot of people .
When you go into this room , you 're UNK , and you 've got to tell your family , and you 've got to tell your neighbors about UNK stories .
It 's such a great way , and Charles Darwin once said he changed his mind , and then he saw UNK in the air , and then UNK up the back of the sky .
Kenya , all around the world , it 's going to have a lot of damage to lose these fantastic species .
Thank you very much .
And we 've been working in many ways to help us to live better .
And we 're not going to be able to meet our neighbors , because we live in the public space in New York City , which is difficult to be done in the same public space .
So in the last few years , I 've been trying to use a different way to use paper , digital and UNK , and also to share more things in the public spaces .
So , all of these projects , is , " What 's going on here in my neighborhood ? "
How can we be able to get more and more of the time in the neighborhood when we get more ?
How do we be able to share all kinds of new architecture for free development and better understand how we live ?
How can we look at the future of our neighborhoods to the future of our community to the future of our society ?
I live in New Orleans , and I 'm deeply obsessed with the city .
The big pile of these creatures that come up to be the same way that my soul is going to be a few years later , UNK and UNK -- it 's a little bit of fun , and it 's a little bit of a city , and I 'm optimistic that you 're all in the middle of the music world .
For every time , I feel like I 'm a UNK , and I feel like a team .
The New Orleans has many of the most beautiful buildings in the world , and she 's also the largest city of building buildings .
I 'm living in the house , and I think it 's better than to think about the other thing , and it changed my life .
In 2009 , I lost a guy .
Her name is UNK , and she 's like my mom , and she 's suddenly , and she 's never going to be able to get it .
And then I thought a lot about death , and then I thought , well , I had a little bit of fun about my life , and it turns out that my life had real stuff .
But I 'm also not going to keep the heart inside of the daily life .
I think it 's very important to remember what 's going on , and forget about what it 's about to be a really important thing .
I 've been working on a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of UNK , and I think , " I think , " I think , " I think , " I think , " I think , " I think , " I think , " I think , every time , we 're going to be able to put together all of these things in public security .
I don 't know if you go through this experiment , but the next day , the walls of the walls are filled with new answers .
I 'd like to share with you a little bit of something that we wrote about the walls .
" I thought , " I thought , " I 'd like to look at my UNK for UNK . "
" I 'd like to go back in the age of the UNK UNK UNK . "
" I thought , " I 'd like to sing , " before you go back . "
" I thought , " I thought , " I thought , " I thought , " I thought , " I thought , " I thought , " I thought , " I thought , " I thought , " I thought , " I thought , " I thought , " I thought , " I thought , " I thought , " I thought , " I thought , " I thought , " I thought , " I thought , " I thought , " I thought , " I thought , " I thought , " I thought , " I thought , " I thought , " I thought , " I thought , " I thought , " I thought , " I thought , " I thought , " I want a tree . "
" I think , " I think , " I think , " I think , live , I think about living life . "
" I thought , " I 'd like to go back a long time before die . "
" I want to be a member of a man for death . "
" I 'd like to do what I was going to do , and I wanted to do what I had to do . "
It 's been a fantastic building , and it 's a very exciting place to think about , and I think , really , that there 's a lot of joy , and there 's a lot of UNK that I 've been working on .
That makes us believe that we don 't have to be alone .
Let 's start with the neighbors and we have new ideas .
It 's the space that we 've set up and think about , and it 's really important for us to change how we 're going to change the process .
So , I 've been working with this , and I 've been able to start with a little bit of a little bit of UNK , and I 've been working with a little bit of a little bit of the walls that we 've been working on -- there 's UNK UNK , UNK UNK , South Africa , South Africa .
Well , these signs , if we can share the opportunity to share it with others , it 's a huge space for us to go up with the public space .
One of the most valuable things we have , and one of them is one of the time we 've got to go to other people .
It 's really important to remember , and it 's time for the long time , the UNK of life and life , which is more important than anything that 's going on .
We had no courage to talk about death or death at death , but I realized , because death is something that we can do with the most powerful thing we can do .
It 's more likely to think about death about death .
It 's better to think about the public space , and there 's a lot of new ways to think about that , fear and experience that we have to help ourselves better , better than to help us better than better .
Thank you .
Thank you .
I 'm in the UNK UNK UNK UNK .
The air is hot , and it 's filled with UNK .
I can feel that people are going through my body , and I don 't see anything else in the dark , and I don 't see anything else .
I 've heard about the sound of a week , but more or less of the noise , which is , of course , the noise of noise .
On the other hand , I went up to the front of the UNK , and I had a little bit of UNK on the wall , and they 'd put a lot of UNK on the wall , and they 'd go through that little meters of UNK UNK .
And I was going to go up , and I thought one of the UNK that I 'd seen was the last day , and he was going to go off the edge of the day .
And when I 'm standing here today , you 're going to be living in life , there 's no money , there 's no money , there 's no money , there 's no UNK .
And I ended up out there , and I went home , and I 'd never come back with a few of them .
I 've been working in the early ' 70s , and in the ' 70s , in 2008 , I 'm very honored to be able to be able to meet the UNK of UNK and UNK .
I met a lot of people who came up with a lot of people who came up with the government of the government of the government , which is the combination of the UNK of the modern society .
And we were talking about UNK , and then I started to understand that even though I was told that there was nothing about the war , but it didn 't really know about things .
And then , I think , really bad , and I feel really bad about that , and I don 't know , and there 's a lot of people who don 't know ?
So , this idea that I 'd been going to go back in the last few weeks , and then I went to the Los Angeles to meet UNK UNK , and I wanted to do something about it .
So it began with the journey that I came up with .
So , all right , I 've been there .
So , I 'm also going to put them into one of my second country .
But this time , I 'm going to go back here , and that 's not the secret .
UNK are over 20,000 million people in the world .
The number is two times the size of UNK UNK in Africa .
Ten years ago , there was three times a year in the United States , and it was three times a year .
That 's 50 dollars a day .
But today , there 's a whole population that 's going to be UNK by the home of the country , and there 's only 18 dollars in the country .
And it 's amazing that it 's more than 30 billion dollars a year in the global industry .
And many of them are called UNK UNK , and good jobs are going to be UNK by violence , and it can 't escape .
Today 's war today is worth valuable , and it 's a value of value value , but the value of the value is to be connected .
So , there 's nothing in the face of every aspect of the world , even though it 's illegal to be illegal .
In India and UNK , I was sent to the building .
So here 's the magic feeling like UNK , or UNK , but it 's a place where it 's going to be .
The boys , women , women , are actually a whole home with a whole home full of UNK UNK UNK , which is UNK up the top of the top of the top , and it goes up to the UNK UNK .
UNK and UNK UNK , and they 're quiet , and they 've been working in about seven hours a day , and they 're like 16 hours a day .
It 's not going to eat , it 's not going to eat , it 's not going to drink , you don 't have to drink because of the cold water , and they don 't need to go to the bathroom .
It 's because there 's a lot of passion and UNK that I 've had in the area , and I don 't have to be able to go up .
For every 20 minutes , I had to go out of the car , and I had to go up with the air , and it would be a little bit of a UNK , and I was sitting in the car , and I was going to be able to get a lot of people living in the car .
Come back , I said , " I don 't want to cry , but there 's a lot of UNK on UNK UNK , " UNK , he 's crying , he 's crying . "
And then he talked to me about what happened in this way , which is dangerous to me , and that 's not dangerous for these guys .
I 'm not going to give them anything more directly until anything that 's going on .
I can 't give them money . I can 't give them no .
I 'm not the citizen of the country .
My behavior is probably going to make them worse than worse .
I 'm just going to be able to be able to tell you about the UNK of UNK UNK , and I believe that they can do what they can do .
And then , I had to wait to go back home .
In the UNK , I saw a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of UNK , and I saw a lot of the mountains in the front of the streets and waiting for the toilet .
So , those are the kids who are going up with the UNK , or the kids that are using the trees , the eggs , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK UNK .
Now , it 's a pretty painful thing . It 's just a bit of a painful story .
How can we prevent these kinds of things that we 're going to be able to prevent , but what 's going on ?
Some people don 't even think that they 're in the population of being raped by half a day , because they 're born like this .
There 's nothing more than that .
If they 're free for free , they burn up all of their homes .
It 's just a bad story , and they 'd like to put it in front of the island , and they continue to do the same thing , but now it 's a free , and it 's going to be able to get rid of the way they 've got the freedom .
The challenge is that we 've heard the most common way in which we 've been called the police , and that 's the case for me to go through the industry .
I 've been trained for some of the women 's women .
They brought me in the front of the line , and I went into a UNK area .
That 's not a hospital .
It 's more like a restaurant .
The restaurants in the industry is known as well .
A little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of young women and kids who are seven years old who are forced to get the customers to get more food and beer .
It 's a little bit of a UNK wall , and it 's a little bit like a UNK , and the window is open to the window .
It 's very popular for the people who are willing to engage in this work .
Remember that was a little bit of hunger in the middle of the day , and I was thinking of UNK as well .
Here 's just one of the UNK that I 've been coming up here .
There 's no way .
There 's no mobile phone .
These guys are completely UNK , and it 's important to understand that we have to deal with this problem , which is a little bit more than that , including in our backyard .
A few thousand people were farmers in Europe , and family didn 't stop them .
Recently , in New York , there was one million children who were sold to be called UNK .
These things happen to us , and we just don 't know it .
That is also the case that we 've heard about AIDS workers .
I 've been in India in India where the family was UNK .
This is a guy called " UNK . "
That 's the little black hand that comes out of the dead blue here , and the red color here is between two children .
They were UNK up in the supermarket , and then put it in deep deep into the deep deep , and then it 's been toxic .
UNK to tell me about their stories .
" We don 't have freedom . "
" Maybe we 're hoping that we 're going to be able to leave the house to the rest of the house and to go to the report . "
UNK , there are more than 400 of these kids who have been UNK UNK in UNK UNK , and there 's the largest population of people in the world .
And I 'm here , and I go to the point .
I see it almost as a family , two of them , a few little kids , just like this .
Okay , they 're UNK .
The kids are taken out of the ship , and they 're forced to go up in the boat , and they don 't even have to swim in the boat .
This little boy is eight years old .
And when we go up close through the boat , he 's afraid , he 's in his boat . He 's in his boat .
He 's afraid he 's going to die .
On the edge of the lake , there 's a lot of trees that are going to go through the trees , which is , of course , who are afraid of kids .
A lot of people are dead .
From him , it was forced to work .
He 's very afraid of the normal person , and it 's not going to go up because he 's been fascinated by the same way that he 's working with him .
I 've seen them in the morning in the last five or 40 percent of the time , and they started working in the morning .
It 's cold , it 's evening .
You know , there are hundreds of UNK in fish that are filled with fish .
I want to tell you about UNK .
He 's been trained from one of the village .
By the time he 's seen from the UNK UNK , which is a place for UNK UNK .
And he 's looking at the front of it , and he 's going to go up and put it in front of your car , and it 's a great part of it , and they 've been able to be able to cook , and it 's going to be safe for kids .
So , there 's a possibility of UNK inside of that .
It 's because there 's a human mind , and it 's going to affect his life , and it 's possible for his life to change its future .
And the car was working in the same direction of UNK UNK , and we had a little bit of a car that was very close to our car , and we were UNK up in the car .
He asked us to go to the east of the world .
On the road , he forced us to go up with the car .
And then he pointed up , and he said , " That 's it . That 's it . That 's it . "
And we had UNK UNK , and we walked up by a little bit of a long time , and we didn 't have the camera , and I put it in the top of the chest , and he was going to go up .
And then you go through two little hour , and we don 't have one of the space that we 've ever seen in front of the space , which is one of the big fields that we 've got UNK over there .
A lot of women are waiting for their kids , and they 've been working on the UNK of UNK water .
That 's what it 's used for money to offer money .
These guys are killed in the UNK of UNK in Ghana .
And when they go out of UNK , there 's nothing like that .
I remember the eyes of the red blood , and there was a lot of people who had been working on this for seven hours .
There are more than 90 meters of them , and they 've come up with UNK , and these rocks are sent to the other area , and it 's been UNK .
By the way , there 's a healthy man , but we 've been able to meet some of the kids who have been affected by the rest of the world , there are some little kids .
They 're UNK victims .
In fact , these muscles , many boys , are probably going to be able to tell us about the individual and the UNK of the breast cancer .
This is UNK UNK , and he died , and his uncle sold him to sell him in his job .
After his uncle , UNK UNK , he was forced to go up with his uncle , and he was forced to move on the farm .
I 've seen one of the things that he 'd been working on in the last 40 years , and it 's been UNK , and the doctor 's going to be UNK .
And by the way , there was a lung cancer , and he had to wait for the next day , and he had to stay in the morning .
And even though , he also wants to be able to learn how to do that , and that is , of course , the way that we 're going to help the education , which is a little bit more difficult to think about , and it 's a little bit more difficult than I can think of .
I hope that we are going to be UNK .
So I took a lot of UNK on the way , and I 'd like to look at my story and be able to share their stories with their stories , and I 've taken this series of pictures .
And they know that these images are going to be seen up there .
And I 'd like to tell them , because we 're trying to tell them what we can do , and then we can change them .
I 'm really sure that if we think of them as well , it 's hard to think about UNK .
These images are a debate , and it 's about people , and with you , and the dignity and the dignity of life .
I don 't have to think about these beautiful , but it 's very close to the people who live in the future , and some of them will be able to meet people .
I hope that these images , I hope , is the size of the size of the size of the planet , because there 's no reason for that , because there 's nothing going on there , which is going to continue to live in the face .
Thank you .
In short words , I 'm learning math is a special problem for the people who are going to be able to tell you about the mathematics of mathematics , which is , of course , that we 're very much more .
Nobody knows what we 're doing .
So I 'm going to show you a bit about what we 're doing .
Well , UNK is one of the population of human beings .
We 're going to be able to dance with the teacher and the dance of the dance , and you 've got to know .
So , it 's also a fantastic understanding of the professional knowledge of knowledge and UNK , and even a few of them , and that 's probably one of the problems we can say about .
But , of course , the spirit of UNK , which is , of course , the UNK of UNK , which is the great opportunity for UNK UNK , UNK UNK , and he 's a UNK dancer .
And there 's been a lot of treatments in these years , and there are lots of treatments .
However , there are six million people on this disease , and there are UNK , UNK , UNK , and all the things that we need to have in common ways .
And we need to look at the bottom , and we need to look at the end of the future , which is , of course , the only way that we have to learn about it is to be able to answer the question of questions .
But the reason is that we don 't have UNK , and we don 't have a physical UNK , and you can 't just see the UNK that we can do , and that 's just the case that we have to do with that .
You 've got to go up the clinic , and it 's going to be the same thing , and it 's going to be done in the clinical trial , because there 's not been done in the trial .
But , what if the patient is going to be able to do this test ?
Is it the case that the patient 's waiting for the patient for the patient , and if the patient is going to form the test , then , what is the opportunity to do with the patient ?
You don 't need to spend a lot of money to hire the staff . "
By the way , if you go to the neuroscience , it costs about 300 dollars .
So I 'd like to introduce you to the case of a very simple way , because you know , in some sense , we 're all kind of like my friend UNK UNK .
So here I have a little bit of a UNK .
It 's a bit of a UNK , which is when we think of UNK , we have to deal with these sensors , which is actually true , for example , for example , if you like , say , " UNK . "
And there 's also a special training that we 've been working on .
It 's time for you to think about , and there 's a lot of time .
From sound , we can look at things like UNK UNK , which is that we can affect ourselves .
So you can see that the bottom run in the bottom is a little bit of a UNK .
And we 're seeing the symptoms .
UNK , UNK , and UNK .
It 's going to be a little bit of a little bit of a little bit more UNK , and then something like that .
In fact , it 's very hard to look at the most part of the software that we 've been working with , and we need to be able to use software , and we 're going to be able to get sure that you 're going to be healthy and disease , and that is just the case of health .
So , the idea of language , how is it going on , how is it that we 're going to be able to do that kind of thing ?
So , there 's nothing to be creative about , and they 're using basic equipment .
You don 't need to design a series of new hospitals .
They also have a problem . So , of course , it 's not the case , but it 's not the main test of language .
That means that the patient can do it .
And it 's fast , and it 's also fast , it 's about 30 seconds .
The price is very low , and we also know how it 's going to go back .
And once the price of the price , it 's going to be the scale of scale .
I 've got a great goal here today .
We can reduce the problems of the patient and the patient .
They 're not going to be able to do what to do .
And we can go through the frequency rate , and we can take the data data .
We would be able to use a lot of trials in clinical trials , and cost them very easily , and we can also be able to be able to be able to show that number of numbers in the first time , and it 's possible for a long time .
And we 're also going to start looking at the age of disease in the early days of life .
So , in the day , the first step , we started with UNK UNK , which is a project for UNK UNK .
There 's also a collaboration with UNK UNK , and we 'd like to remember that there 's a huge amount of data that comes out of the world .
Our city code is going to be about 70 million of people in the planet .
Any health , or the patient , the patient , the patient , is just a little bit less money , and I 'm glad that we 're getting six percent of our time .
Thank you .
UNK , just like this , and you can 't even tell you , who 's going to be healthy , who is the patient ?
What do you want to be like in the future ?
Yes , yes , so that 's where we have to tell us about whether you 're going to have a disease , TED .
You know , some are probably not going to give us , or no .
But we 're also going to be able to move data from different environments in different environments , and it 's a different environment , because we 're able to get rid of the UNK factors that we have to do with that .
So you 've got eight percent chance of eight percent .
It 's never been done .
In fact , I 'm going to give you a little bit of the reason , because he 's been able to figure out how he 's going to be able to get a project online , and it 's going to be able to do this project , so that we are now 90 percent of the time .
UNK percent , okay , that 's not great .
So , when you go to the phone , and you go up with the phone , and then you can go through the phone , and then they can go through the sound , and then their doctors are going to go up and they 'll be able to get them to the point where they 're going to be able to understand .
That 's it .
Thank you very much , Chris and all of the people .
Thank you .
I 've been really excited about this , but I 'd like to tell you about 15 pictures of my favorite pictures , which is not just a picture .
There 's no art , there 's no such thing , there 's no big opportunity , there are no more abstract effects .
In fact , many of them are taken from the phone .
My story came to me in New York , and my wife took a picture of me , and I was born with one of my daughter 's birthday , and we were standing in the New York and the fifth area .
And then , after a year , we went back to New York City , so we decided to take a look at the same picture .
You can guess why things happen .
When I was three years old , the wife said , " Hey , you don 't have to go back to New York City , and you 've got to go into this little example , and you 're going to go into this little bit of age ? "
That 's the way that we 're going to go out of the way that we 're going to go .
You know , it 's very popular for us to put up an extraordinary human experience , and it 's not very popular .
No one 's going to fail , and , unfortunately , there 's not a lot of people running around us .
Well , we don 't even know about the journey that we can change our lives .
For us , it 's going to become UNK up .
That 's a couple of weeks later , and I was trying to explain what happened in the early days of the day , and it 's going to be a little bit of a young child .
So these pictures are not just recorded about one moment , or a special journey .
It 's a bit of time for 10 months , and we think back in the last year , and we 've been working on the last year , which is how we change , and we 're not going to be able to change the body , not just in the body , but also in the future .
Because , as I look at the same time , we 're different images , and she 's in a new way , and I 've looked at living in the eyes of her eyes , looking at what she 's doing , how it 's going to look like everything .
It 's a place that we 're seeing right now , and one of the most common moments in the last year .
The last time we walked up , and she suddenly stopped , and she 's talking about a red whale , and she 's very popular about that , and it 's a long time since we 've been in the long term .
She 's going to be dead when she 's five years old .
And she said , " Well , she 's going to be in the morning , and she 's going back , and that 's nine years ago .
Now , she 's going to be in New York City , because she decided to go to New York .
I suddenly understand that we have the most important thing we create .
So I 'd like to share with you a little bit of a creative , and I want to think about the ideas of memory .
I don 't know how many of you are , but I 'm not going to be talking about that , and I 'm not going to go into the family .
I was always the guy that was taken .
I 'd like to encourage you to go up here today , to get you to the right place , and to go back to the table , " Can we take a look at the table ? "
Thank you .
