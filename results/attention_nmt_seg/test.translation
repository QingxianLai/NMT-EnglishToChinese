I was 11 years old , and I remember this morning , waiting for the last day .
My father was in the middle of this beautiful radio chair .
And he took his eyes , and this was very rare , because most of all of the news got him frustrated .
The Taliban . ' The father . "
I don 't know what that means , but I can see the fathers are very happy .
" You can go to the real school . " He said .
I never forget that morning .
A real school .
When I was six years old , the Taliban were asked to school for girls to school .
So after that , five years old , I got married and I had a secret school that was never allowed to be outside .
This is the only way that we live in education .
We are not going to worry about where we 're going to worry about where we 're going to worry about where we are going to get there .
We 're going to put it in the food UNK that other people think that we are just going to go shopping .
In a house , we had a small living in a small room .
It 's very , very , very hot .
We knew that we were living with the danger of life -- teachers , students and parents .
Sometimes , in the school , a week later , because of the Taliban .
We were always worried about the Taliban .
Are we going to track ?
Do they know where we live ?
We were scared , but we had to be able to go to school .
I was very lucky to be able to grow a family of girls .
My grandfather was an extraordinary person in his mind .
And he was born in Afghanistan for Afghanistan , with other people , who insisted to his daughter , my mother , to go to school , so he was forced to work with his father .
But my mother had become a teacher .
That 's her .
She went back two years ago , and the door became a school for girls and women .
My father -- who -- he -- he 's the first person in his family .
So there was no education , including his daughter , despite the Taliban , despite the risks .
By the way , kids don 't accept education for education .
In the Taliban , in the Taliban , I remember sometimes I was scared that I would never be afraid to see the future .
I 'd like to give up , but my father would say , " Listen , my daughter , you 'll lose anything anything you can do in your life .
Your money is UNK , and you may be a war for war .
And the only thing that you can get out there is this , and if we had to sell the blood , we 'd be able to do that .
Even if you don 't think about that ? "
I 'm 22 years old .
My country had decades of wars in decades .
My age of women , high women in high school in high school , if I didn 't have a family , I would be like most people .
I 've been a proud of UNK .
One of the world 's top of the world of the United States , in the United States , in the United States , in the middle of the United States , in the middle of the world , my grandfather , came to the old man who had all the women in the world , and the first time I got UNK .
He wasn 't just because my college didn 't , because in women , I was the first car in women in women , and I was the first driver of women .
And my family was trust .
My dreams are so large , but they are more expensive to my expectations .
And this is the reason that I became the world 's Law ; this is a global organization for women education .
And that 's the reason that I got involved in the case -- this is the first time that maybe Afghanistan -- because in Afghanistan , it will be very dangerous for the education .
I 'm excited , and I see my students in my school can learn better than that .
I see their parents , especially their father , like my father , even though they see fear .
So , for example , this is not the case , I couldn 't let you see his face , he 's my father .
You can 't get to a month ago , and his daughter went from the streets of his village , they were dying to die .
By the way , the phone says , " If he could send his daughter to school , that would be going to happen again .
" If you think , now you killed me . ' He said , " But I don 't get my daughter 's mind to destroy my daughter 's future . "
And for Afghanistan , I didn 't realize that it was the West -- this was the father of our success -- this was an amazing success to her daughter -- an amazing success to her father .
And this is not the women who are not going to be very important for our success .
In fact , for the good future of our daughters , they 're usually the most powerful and UNK , but in the world like Afghanistan , we had to have a male support .
In the Taliban , there were hundreds of people who didn 't forget -- don 't forget that it was illegal .
But today , there was more than three million people in education .
Afghanistan is very different from the United States .
I found that the United States can see the difference between us .
I worry about how much it could be done in the United States .
But when I went back to Afghanistan to see my students and support them to encourage their parents , I saw the hope that this change will continue .
By the way , in Afghanistan , like , in Afghanistan , almost like that , in the day of two girls in UNK , she would be able to remind me .
Like me , they had a big dream .
Thank you .
Everything that I did , both in my life -- my entire life was going to be very , very , very , very young .
I was very young , but I had a lot of young , but I was old -- I was born in town in Zambia , Kenya , UNK , UNK , UNK .
I was working in Italy . We built every program in Africa .
I keep going crazy .
At the end of 21 , I thought , " Well , we did good at Africa . "
But what do we do ?
The first project that I wrote about the first book I wrote about the first book , called " The UNK of UNK . " And in this project , we decided to teach the UNK .
So , the seeds that we bring in Italy to the south and a beautiful valley , and the UNK -- we teach them in Italy to plant them in Italy , and so on and so on .
Of course , there are no interest in this , so we paid a lot of money to work , and they were just for a while .
And there was such a lot of UNK , the people who weren 't very surprised , and we were very surprised .
But we didn 't ask them , but by the way , " UNK . "
" UNK " in a hunger with a line of dying . "
Of course , in Africa , there are good things .
We are very , very , very , very , in Italy , in Italy , in this case , in Zambia , in Zambia .
It 's unbelievable . We talk to UNK : " UNK , how easy it is . "
By the way , the bad thing about UNK , which is the night that killed millions of thousands of people in the world will be able to keep all of all the bees and all of the other parts of all the world .
And we said , " Oh my God , this is the UNK . "
UNK says , " Yeah , this is the reason we 're not here . "
" Why don 't you read that ? " And you didn 't ask . "
I thought that there were people in Africa for us in Africa , but when I knew that the Americans , in the United States , when you see their behavior , I was very proud of it .
Because , in fact , we UNK the UNK .
You 're going to be able to look at all this stuff -- -- you see , how much of the people in this room , we 're going to have to believe these things to trust Africa .
You can read this book , " UNK UNK . "
This book was published in 2009 .
And in this case , in the last 50 years , the two million dollars in the world for Africa had a million dollars in Africa .
I 'm not going to talk about the damage .
You 're going to read it .
You can see a lot of other women in this country , and there are so much we can do .
So , in fact , in the world , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK .
These two words come from the UNK , " UNK , UNK . "
But there are different words .
The parents say that I was thinking of my whole world , like my child . " I love you . "
I mean , by the way , I 'm going to ask the other part of the world , in my case .
And this is why , in Africa , in India called " UNK . "
When I read a book , like George UNK , the book called " The UNK , " which is the most important thing that he said , " If you don 't want to help people help them , you will get them . "
This is the first principle of aid .
And the first principle of aid is to respect .
And this morning , Mr. UNK , in the course of this conference , said , " We can 't -- can you imagine a city that no longer had a new deal ? "
By the age of AIDS , I made a decision to be treated by people , and I started the work of work , called " UNK . " And so we don 't encourage anyone to work for anyone , and to work for people to find better life in the world .
So , the thing that we were going to do is shut down .
When we walked into a community , I wouldn 't be able to build any of these ideas , but to connect them with the people .
We didn 't work at the office .
We met with the UNK and UNK .
We had no infrastructure to build infrastructure .
And what we did , is , they were very interested in their friends , and they discovered their interest .
The most important is passion .
You can tell your ideas to your ideas .
But if they don 't care , what do you do ?
And this is the most important thing about the client .
And the passion for each other is to create the infrastructure that are most important .
And then we helped them collect information and information , because this is not the case of the line , the UNK .
Some of the ideas are not getting out of knowledge , but we can support .
So a lot of years ago , I had an idea that we couldn 't really hear their ideas or not be able to kill them against them , but this can 't work with the forms of the community .
I 'll tell you a secret .
There 's a problem in the community .
And entrepreneurs don 't usually tell you they 're going to tell you that they 're going to give money , in the way , in their business .
So , the plan is going to be a UNK .
You don 't even have the smartest of the people in the community , because they don 't really get to the public .
So , our approach to be , we had to be able to build a society where we had to be able to build a potential of social infrastructure .
We had to create a new career .
This kind of career in the private school , the company , and the way to your family , or in your kitchen , or in your kitchen table , can help you build your business passion to be able to build your business .
I spent an experiment in UNK .
I was reading about Dr. UNK , and then , after all , in this case , UNK UNK .
And the first year I spent my first college year , and I got this number of guys , and I taught him to sell fish to people who were going to be able to sell a restaurant and help him to work on it , and in the end of the people who said , " You are the people who sell fish -- you can help us help us ? "
And I 'm going to take this five percent of the bees and not to be the hot ones to sell them to the UNK , and then we 'd be able to do that , and then we helped them to help us and help us to help us with that money ? "
In a year , I made an UNK program , and the government got to ask me , " What are you going to do ?
You can see why I said , " I made a really hard thing .
So , you know , you 're silent . You hear them . "
So -- so the government said , " Well , let 's do it . "
In 300 communities in the world , we started this program .
We 've had to build a company called UNK .
New generations of entrepreneurs have been UNK by UNK .
UNK , the great deal of all of the world 's UNK , UNK years ago , UNK .
UNK was a philosophical professor , Dr. UNK UNK , who said , " The agenda is to be the business of the business of the business and the business of the business of business . "
And the plan is the business of the business .
Now , the UNK that we don 't have to think about is how many people who want to be able to use their own money and their energy .
We had to learn how to make these people .
We had to give them their privacy , and respect their privacy , and we had to work for them , so that they would be able to work for them .
In a case of 10,000 people , we had 200 customers .
You can imagine a community of UNK , how many UNK and passion ?
What are you going to be on a third presentation today ?
It 's a place of UNK . You can 't do it for them .
So I want to say that the business of business is the rise of the world .
When we were in the first industry of the Industrial Revolution , we used to be able to build the fuel fuel , the manufacturing industry , but we suddenly realized that it was not sustainable .
And the engine of the gas engine had a day .
You can 't do it by UNK .
What we 're trying to care about is how we 're going to get seven to good people in the developing world , health , education and communication .
And the technology is not going to do that .
Who can be the technology revolution to get green revolution ? You don 't think !
Government ? Don 't .
These are entrepreneurs , and they are fighting for the struggle .
Many years ago , I saw an interesting article on the UNK magazine .
UNK , a group of experts who were invited to talk about what was going on in New York .
So this is UNK , and they all get the idea of the New York City , and they made the case -- 100 years later , the New York City .
Why ? Because they looked at this map , and they said , " If you continue to see how much it would be , like , in this case , in New York City , they needed to be able to get a tree of six feet of water that would be able to do the same thing . "
By the way , they will be UNK .
So UNK , they thought , this kind of UNK technology will save New York .
So what happened ? 40 years later , with the United States , there were more than two million companies in the United States .
By finding this new technology is going to be an epidemic , and there 's a lot of UNK .
So , for example , New York City , New York City .
But there is a secret to trade .
First of all , you 're going to give them a commitment .
Otherwise they wouldn 't come to talk about you .
And then you give them a passion for them .
You 're going to tell them to be the good part of the world .
Whether you 're a company or a small company , you 're going to be good for three things -- the quality of the market is going to be more effective and more effective .
What 's the question ?
There was never a single person in the same time or the sales and the financial work .
This person is not there .
This is not the case .
We made a survey to study more than 100 percent of the world in the world called UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , New Jersey .
So there is a common business in all of these things that there is only one or not just a business .
Now , we went to work at the University of New Year , and we started to figure out how many pages were they using the Internet , and they were able to figure out how many times we could use this word " The word " and " How many times " and " How many times we used to use it " and " How many times we used " in this word " and " How many times " ? "
She never said , " We used to be fired for 32 times . "
He was not alone , at the beginning .
Nobody can build a company . Nobody .
So , we can build a community , in this community , in the UNK , in the coffee , in the UNK , in the UNK , in the UNK , in the UNK , in the UNK , in the UNK , in the UNK , in the UNK , in the hand , in the hand , in the hand , in the way . " What are you going to do about this woman , you 're going to ask you for that ? " What are you going to do about this ? "
What do you do ? You can produce it ?
You can sell it ? You can make money ? "
" Ah , I can 't get any help . UNK . "
We encouraged them to be entrepreneurs in the community .
We had volunteers and people to work for the business for the business , the human wisdom to create an incredible culture of cultural culture and economy that you could be able to use it to be able to use it to be able to do that .
Thank you .
Within five years ago , I had a UNK that was UNK .
In UNK University University , I asked them to learn lessons about how to communicate .
I was scared .
I really scared the bad news , the brain that they read , and the words that they read them , and they used to get too scared to me .
But , in the conversation , like I did , like the UNK hole , seeing the door to another new world .
And this is the way that my students talk about them , and I 'm excited about other things to be able to experience that , and that I wish to be able to experience this experience .
I believe that the key to open the world is to have good communication and communication .
In order to change the world , we need to be able to change some of these scientists and engineers .
So , our scientists and engineers are dealing with the big problems that we face from energy to health care , etc . And if we don 't understand why we don 't have the responsibility to communicate with them to communicate with them .
But if our scientists and engineers don 't look at the world , we wouldn 't have a very good communication .
So scientists and engineers , we are going to talk about what technology is .
I 'd like to share with you a couple of these ways that you can make sure that we 'll be able to make sure that you might be able to ensure that your science is going to be like , " UNK UNK UNK , your engineering . "
The first is to answer our question : what is the technology ?
Tell us why your science is related to us .
Don 't tell me that you can 't work with the bones of UNK , and to tell me that you 're not interested in the bone industry -- because of this bone industry , in this way , is very important .
And the other thing is that , when you describe science , you 're going to be able to figure out how to use it .
And the thing is that we understand the barrier .
Of course , you can say , " UNK and UNK " -- why don 't we think much more about it .
Let 's make it easy , very simple to make it .
Instead , as Einstein said , let 's make things like that , not for the simple , but by the way .
You don 't need to change your ideas to make sure your science theory .
You can think of some examples , the story , and the analogy . These are all the things that are very excited to tell us about how we are excited about how we are excited about .
I 'm going to show you a little bit at the end of the slide , don 't make a difference .
You 've got to say , " Why don 't you get off a UNK ? "
UNK ? UNK can kill you . You can see your show report .
And like this slide like this slide is not boring , and it 's too much to rely on the language of our brain .
And this is something that 's been done on a film that 's been done by the UNK of UNK , which is very powerful for the UNK of the UNK of the UNK of UNK .
So this is the UNK , the UNK , to the audience -- even if you can 't figure out what to do , and then we give them some of the images that we 're going to believe in the world , and we 'll be able to define what we think about it .
So this is what I think can be able to help us and make these things that are good for the good things that are going to work for science and engineering .
So , because of the engineers that I did , I 'd like to conclude with a theory that I 'd like to summarize my perspective .
And the science of the science that you can 't share with you -- is to share it with a lot of good things , but you 're going to talk about things that are very good for what you 're doing , and you 're going to be -- you 're going to be very , very excited about this incredible relationship of interaction with this amazing relationship .
So , scientists and engineers , when you think about this , you know , the way to talk about things you 're going to talk about .
Thank you .
And one of my favorite words is called " UNK . "
Not only that it sounds very good .
And this means " A UNK . "
And even though this is a very good definition of what happened , he said , " Well , this is such an amazing guy , " he will not care " -- he doesn 't care about all the problems or any subject or any of the principles . "
I don 't really understand " UNK . "
So , like , in the words of words like this , I suppose I suppose .
But the word is very important for the political centers , and all those politicians have to figure out how they 're going to try to control their speech .
UNK , for example , the president of the United Nations who allowed the news to report about the real words of politicians in the world .
And this is all because of a soul , this great name is called " UNK . "
He was killed by the London UNK , but he was a very brave and brave courage to UNK her to a lot of people who had no support in the London .
And for a few years , we had the first record ever since UNK UNK .
A lot of people think this is an image of metal .
No , it 's come from an end of news .
But in order of words and politics , I want you to go back to the United States , and in this case it just announced it .
And they had a question for how they thought , " Well , they are leaders . "
They don 't know .
What is the leader leader ?
This is a long time in Congress .
And there is a lot of advice that they are possible .
I mean , some people call him UNK UNK , who 's called UNK UNK , who 's called " The UNK of UNK . "
There was never a single name .
Some of them were just trying to name him .
They thought it was the case of the past .
And they didn 't even get the same way , and their idea was that you could have an UNK of the king of the king .
You can see that that 's going to be possible .
And everybody got bored , and in fact , because of this debate , it 's been on for three weeks .
I read about this poor UNK , and there was a real event that was the question for the question . "
And the reason for UNK and tired is the fact that it 's the end of the UNK .
UNK don 't want to be on the Washington . It 's the power of the power .
They didn 't want him to call him what he was , or his God or his UNK .
So they gave him a place that they could not be able to figure out , " UNK , " which is the most , very , very , very famous .
And this is called " UNK . "
UNK UNK . And they didn 't create this . I mean , this is just like a conference .
UNK of UNK UNK .
And it wasn 't very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very UNK .
I think there 's a bunch of thousands of other people in this class , and there 's a theory of what they 're doing , but it 's just not true .
And this is why the news is against this .
And they said this is just ridiculous . You can 't call him a conference .
This person has to do the law and the UNK .
Who 's going to use him , if he had such a stupid , like the UNK of the United States , like the American government .
After three weeks , there was no UNK .
By the way , they agreed to be the UNK , but they were not sure that they didn 't agree with it , and they were UNK , by UNK , by UNK , in the same way , in the same term , in the same way , in the same term , in the same case , in the same case , in the same case , in the same case , in the same case , in the same case , in the same way , in the same way , in the same way , in the same way , in the same way , in the same way , in the same way , in the same way , in the same way , in the same way , in the same way , in the same way , in the same way , in the same way , in the same way , in the same way , in the same way , in the same way , in the same way , in the same way , in the same way , in the same way , in the same way ,
Now , you can learn about three interesting things in this story .
First of all , this is my favorite place where I could find this , early in the world , never before the president .
UNK UNK , " The President of Obama , " which is now bad for the last four years .
And the second thing that you can see is that , in the United States , this is just a temporary , you 're going to keep a long time .
But the third thing that you can see , and this is very important , I want you to remember this , and this is the title of the United States .
There are more than 5,000 percent of the world who are UNK , and there are other countries in the world , and there are UNK and other UNK .
UNK of reality , the history of history .
So the end is going to win .
And they got the UNK .
And the other thing that happened was that it was very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very sad , in this case , in fact , and it sounds like a little bit of a funny time .
But now , you know how many countries are there ?
UNK .
These are all because they wanted to give their names to be like 5,000 people like this , and so on .
So , in the end , the press won 't get the end of it , because there was no reason to tell them that they were the American government of the United States .
And this is a very important lesson that I think that you can learn from that , and that I 'm going to leave you with a few points .
UNK , UNK and use the words to shape and control , but in fact , change the word is much more to change than the word of the word .
Thank you very much .
I 'm following the last 50 years of the UNK UNK , and I was 19 years old , and I was a guy named UNK UNK and UNK .
I used to use the UNK of black UNK , and I didn 't think of the gold of the Chinese UNK .
This is my first time .
And I grew up in the war with a UNK , a day for a football game and a woman who was not at the same time , in the audience , in the audience , in the world , " UNK ! " And then you don 't know what it means to be the UNK of the UNK .
But that 's what it is .
So I 'm standing here today with the blood vessels in Afghanistan , and God UNK my UNK , an atheist and a radical political artist and in the last nine years , working in the last nine years , working in the last nine years .
In Afghanistan , you can create a lot of things about it , but I don 't want to be able to figure out how to create the art of the identity of the identity of the identity of the identity and the UNK of the world and the UNK of the world that they may be able to understand what the world is going to be thinking about .
I 'd like to live a woman with a journalist , and he wore a UNK , and he would like to beat the UNK and UNK in the UNK , and the politics of religions and the politics of politics .
These jihad , except for the election to the public elections , he said , " UNK me ! I 'm a journalist ! What do I do about that ? "
I 've tried to get an election to get out of the election , and these are the people who are in the world .
I 'd like to see this as an UNK , in Afghanistan , in the streets of Iraq , in the streets of Iraq , or not to be able to stop a bribe , or give them money , or give them money for the company , or for the last 50 years , to be able to ask them to give them a company that killed this new country .
I 'd like to know that there is an art to this conflict between Afghanistan .
How do we create this physical world with UNK and UNK that will be designed for a new fashion to the soldiers in the soldiers and the UNK of the soldiers in this country , I 'm going to build a standard of UNK in the UNK of India .
And I 'm going to give you a very simple UNK and UNK UNK on the wall and talking about contemporary art , which is to say " white " and " white " white " white " white " white " white " white " white " white " white " and " UNK " as " UNK . "
But if you do that , you 're probably going to be UNK .
But let me do something I had to do , and I asked myself to do that .
That 's what I do . You 're yours ?
Thank you .
Hi , I 'm UNK . I 'm a model .
So , 10 years .
Now , in this room , I 'm going to feel out there because I shouldn 't wear this .
So thanks me to another one .
This is the first stage on the stage , so I think that most of us are very lucky .
And if there were a lot of women who don 't tell me , I 'm going to tell you , but I 'm going to talk about Twitter .
I 'd like to tell you how I was going to change the image in 10 seconds .
This is not the case .
UNK are very uncomfortable , and good news is that I don 't want to wear them .
The worst news is that I 'm going to put this up on the head because you 're going to laugh , so you 're not going to do anything else .
You can .
So , why do I do this ?
This is odd .
UNK don 't sound like an image on the image .
UNK are powerful , but they 're UNK .
I just changed myself in six seconds .
In this picture , in this case , in fact , there was no UNK in the world .
I was very uncomfortable by the photographer to see the hair of a male hair .
And , in case , more than surgery , or like two days , I couldn 't really change the way we see the UNK , although we are very , very , very powerful to the lives of our lives .
So today , for me , this is not just honest .
I 'm here today because I 'm a model .
I 'm in this stage because I 'm a beautiful UNK woman , " UNK girl . "
I 'm going to answer the questions that are often asking my questions to be honest .
The first question is , how do you get the model ?
I always said , " I 'm an UNK . But that 's not the case . "
The real reason I 'm going to model is that I have the genetic genetic , and I 'm the UNK of the world if you 're going to be a big thing .
So , in the past few centuries , in our century , we are not only just as healthy , young , UNK -- UNK , UNK , UNK , rich and white skin .
This is my legacy . This is what I 've been talking about .
Some of you may be wondering , " You may be some kind of UNK , like UNK , UNK , UNK and UNK . "
First of all , I 'm going to encourage you to know about something that is very , very , very , very impressive .
But unfortunately , I 'm going to tell you that in the first time in 2007 , in the New York City University , the number of millions of UNK of all of the world 's brain UNK -- not only four percent of the world 's disease , just like four or four percent of them .
And the next question is , " Do I get to be able to be special ? "
My first answer is , " I don 't know that , because they didn 't get me to do this . "
But the second answer is , I want to ask questions , " Why don 't we like that ? "
You know what ? You can choose anything .
You can be the president of the United States or the UNK of the Internet or the UNK . You 're going to be the first one , because you 're the first one .
And if you hear that , you can 't say , " No , no , UNK , I want to be UNK , " I 'll say , " When my boss . "
Because I couldn 't decide anything , you could be the UNK of the United States , or the UNK , or the UNK .
You 're going to be , when you start to model , you start to get a chance to win .
You can 't do anything in your control , and it 's very interesting , but it 's not a plan industry .
I 'm going to show you a couple of years about how many experiences of my special years , because it wasn 't like an UNK , and the poet UNK it .
So , if you see this thing here , here , like the beautiful UNK , I 'd like to walk on this , and this is the other hand , and this is the other hand , and on the front hand , you can see this , and then , you see , you see , in this case , on the left hand , you see , you see , you see , like , you see , in this case , in front of your friends , on the front hand , you see , like , in this case , in front of your friends , in this case , 400 , 400 , 400 , and then , you see , in this case , like , in this case , on the front left , on the front hand , on the front hand , on the front hand , on the front hand , on the way , in this case , 400 , 400 , 500 , four , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , four , four , four , four ,
This looks like this .
I hope it 's just too strange for the middle .
I don 't know how it works .
And the reality is , when you graduate a bunch of work , you can 't wait the other thing , so if you say you 're going to be the president of the United States , you 're going to talk about it , and you 're going to talk about 10 years that you 're going to hear about you .
The next question is , " Do they build this picture ? "
Yes , they 're almost all the time , but this is just a small part of the work .
This is an example of my first model , and I haven 't seen any of my first time .
I knew this was very private , but I was very young .
This is an image that I did with my grandmother .
This is the picture of the day .
My friend came to me .
This is a picture of my French UNK magazine last few days ago .
This is a picture of my UNK .
This is what I am today .
I hope you 'll see this is not my picture .
So , by the way they made a bunch of researchers -- UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK and UNK , and they made them to build these things , and they weren 't able to build these things .
And the next question is , " Do you get free ? "
I 've had so much of it to get eight inches tall , but free stuff is something that we don 't want to talk about .
I grew up in UNK , and I walked home and I got the money and sent them to me .
By the age of my friend , I was a terrible driver with a bad driver , and we were down to the UNK , and I was just saying , " You 're sorry , " I 'm going to stop .
And I get this because I 'm not going to be the identity , some of them were able to have the power to do the same thing .
I lived in New York , last year , in New York City , who was black and black , most of them were young and young men .
In New York , in New York City , like UNK , for them , are not going to be -- " I 'm going to be in the parking . "
Am I going to stop ? How can I get ? "
When I was working on this presentation , we found that in the United States who were 13 years old in the United States who had not really loved their bodies to get 17 years old , this was going to rise to UNK .
So the last question is UNK UNK . "
I guess they 're going to be a bad answer to you , and your hair will be very happy , and you 're very , very incredible . "
By the way , we gave an answer like this .
And we said , " You can travel and be creative and creative , inspiring people . "
And this is true , but half of all , because we never get to the camera , I would never say , " I never got a security . "
Because I had to worry every day I was going to worry about that .
If you ever thought about my legs , my hair would be better , and I 'm going to be happier .
You 're going to look at the model , because they have all the most of the most toxic legs , the beautiful hair , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the world , the world , in the world , in the world , in the world , in the world , in the world .
So , when I got to work on this presentation , I found out very honest , because , if I were standing here , and I said , " Look , I 'm going to make a lot of things that are not going to be good for that , because if this one , don 't make me happy . "
But the hardest part is to show you the professional traditions of gender and UNK , because I are the biggest of the world .
But I 'm very happy and very happy to be standing in this room , not for 10 , 20 , 20 percent of all kinds of things that are not going to be true , because maybe I don 't talk about how to do the first work , because maybe I 'm going to do something that is so important .
And if this talk is going to help you , I hope that we can all be able to agree with the power of ideas and all the things that we understand about the things we understand .
Thank you .
I 'm going to give you a quick story .
I 'm not going to be a normal person .
I 'd like to introduce you to my two brothers .
This is 22 years old , which is 22 years old .
He didn 't talk about it , but they were able to convey the same way that he would be very , very good at the same time .
UNK knew something like that .
He was not sure that he couldn 't share it .
He didn 't care about the skin .
He UNK the differences . He never talked about UNK .
When he sang us all our childhood , he sang , and he reminded me that we were so UNK about the fact that we knew nothing about the world .
So this is 16 years old , and this is very high .
He has a significant memory .
But this is the memory of choice .
He didn 't remember my chocolate , but I remember the first time that I was in the front of this two songs in the front of the first time , we were in the middle of four and a half years ago , in my arms .
Sounds amazing , isn 't it ?
But a lot of people don 't think that way .
And the truth is , because of their thinking , they don 't seem to be the definition of the quality of the human being , by the very , very UNK .
But let me not believe it , even though they 're not as good as it is , they 're just going to be very , very , very , very , very , very , very interesting .
Some of you may not get too much about this , " UNK , " which is a complex act of the complexity of the complexity , and so there 's an alternative .
Every case of this case are special , so they 're different from UNK .
In the world , in every 20 minutes , there were a new disease that had been very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very
I got the first time , " UNK , " which is the last day I had a day of " UNK . "
When I was three years old , I was very excited I had a new family .
And I realized that he was going to be different from the months .
And he said , " Yeah . "
He didn 't want to play like all the other babies , like , he wasn 't interested in me .
And the UNK UNK , in his own world , UNK the rules that he had fun to do about fun , like the UNK of his legs to move around and UNK to the phone .
And when he grew , he became more unique , and he had to be very , very , very clear .
In addition to UNK , UNK and UNK , the very special part of the world is the nature of the UNK , the world of UNK , the world who never lie .
It 's not very easy .
I couldn 't deny my life , but I wanted them to do it with me .
But I started thinking about what they were going to teach me about the relationship between personality , communication and love , and I didn 't really want to be " normal . "
" UNK " UNK of all the difference between the difference between the differences of the differences .
This is just the case of UNK .
I just wanted to say , " Well , this is not good for you . "
You can be extraordinary .
Whether the difference between us and the differences in all of us , we 're all very , very , very UNK .
UNK and change the possibilities that we think of as much as we think about them .
Please , don 't say " normal . "
Thank you .
Dr. UNK UNK , who was inspired by this UNK , was inspired by the UNK of this photo , and this photo of UNK .
But now , 50 years later , we can get a million and a half million times , and that 's not only in UNK seconds , or UNK seconds .
Now I 'm going to show you a new kind of technology that 's called UNK , and this is a technology that has so much more technology to capture the light of light .
So , using this technology , we can create light to see the camera , to see what we see , we can see the camera , we can see the camera that we see in the brain , and we see this camera challenge that we see about the UNK of the camera .
Now , if I 'm using a laser pen , it will be a few seconds -- I 'll build some of these , and these are just like a few inches of hydrogen , and they 're going to be like a few hundred times a half times faster than the end of the speed of the speed .
Now , if you take this gun , these UNK will get the water , and so those can be hit the bottle ?
What would be the slow speed look like ?
Now the whole thing -- -- this is the whole thing .
Now , remember that this whole , in fact , is the time -- the only time you get -- -- and I 'm going to stop this for a million times more than the light that you see in motion .
But Coke doesn 't fund it .
Now , here 's a lot of things that are going to happen , so let me show you something .
Now , the light bulb goes on the bottle , and this is our gun through the bottle , and inside the inside .
Some of the light goes out , so you start to see these waves .
Many of them eventually ended up in the stream , and moving around .
You can see , this is an empty bubble , and there it is .
And the waves get to the table , and because in the top , you can see , in the top , you see , in the top , you see , you see , you see , you see , in the top , you see , in the top , you see , you see , in the top , you see , you see , you see , you see , in the top , you see , in the top , you see , in the top , you see , you see , in the top , you see , you see , in the top , you see , you see , in the top , you see , you see , in the top , you see , you see , in the top , you see , you see , in the top , you see , you see , in the top , you see , you see , in the top , you see , you see , in the top , you see , you see , in the top , you see , you see , in the
Now , if you 're using the same thing to do the same thing , the same thing , the same times , you know , how long is you going to be able to see how long it was going to see how long it was going to see how long it was going to see how long it was going to be able to see how long it was going to see how long it was going to be able to see how long it was going to be able to see how long it was going to be able to see how long it was going to be able to see how long it was going to see how long it was going to see how long it was going to see how long it was going to see how long it was going to see how long it was going to see how long it was going to see how long it was going to see how long it was going to see how long it was going to see how long it was going to see how long it was going to see how long
One day , a week ago , in fact , a year .
This certainly is boring . This is a slow slow engine .
But something else is going on ?
You can see , in fact , the UNK and the UNK and the walls .
This is like a rock in the water .
I think this is how nature works so natural , but this is the way we see a whole bunch of things .
But if you look at this , you 'll notice that , in the case , the light was obsolete , and it wasn 't there . It wasn 't going on .
Why ? Because UNK , and light in the middle , in the case of UNK , the length of a million seconds .
So , in the future , when you fly the meters of an elevator on your phone , you can go to the supermarket and be able to figure out how fast it can be .
So , how did I make this camera ?
Now the photographer , you know , you get a little bit of light , but we needed a million times faster , so you couldn 't get any light .
So , what we do is , we 're going to put these things together and keep millions and thousands of times , every time , in a few cases , we see this as an image , and this image is the image you see here .
And we bring all of the data to the beginning , and we see very interesting things .
Now , UNK .
There are other heroes who are nervous , but you can see this : he 's going to see what 's going on in the corner .
And this is how we can get the light into the door .
And this light will be able to go back to the room , some of these will be able to go back to the door , and then we can use this light to the light of light .
This is not a real deal . This is what we really do .
On the left , you see the UNK .
In the wall , we had a body model , and we were able to light light .
So , in our paper , " UNK , " by the UNK , then they created this animation .
And they 're going to take off the wire , because this light will be UNK , and it will be UNK , and there will be some light to the other , and in order to go back and get some light , some of the things that will eventually get back to the camera , but the interesting thing is , they 're going to go back to the camera , but the interesting thing is , they 're going to go back to the camera , but the interesting thing is , they 're going to go back to the camera , but the interesting thing is , they 're going to go back to the camera , but the interesting thing is , they 're going to go back to the camera , but the interesting thing is , they 're going to go back to the camera , but the interesting thing is , they 're going to go back to the camera , but the interesting thing is , they 're going to go back to the camera , but the interesting thing is , they 're going to go back to the camera
And because there is a camera that we could run so that we could fly on this camera , and we had some special capabilities .
It has good time . You can see it with the speed of light .
So this , we don 't only know where the camera is down , but you know what 's going on inside the object , but we don 't know what to do .
You can see this in the screen , like nothing , but then we 'll take a lot of things like that , and then we 're going to take a lot of things , and we can see this , and we can see what we see here , that we can see this hidden object , and then we can see this hidden object , and then we can see this hidden object , and so we can see this hidden object ?
Can we see it ?
This is our model .
And now we 're going to get there because we 're going to take the technology to the car , because they 're going to be able to stop track , because we can see UNK , or we can build eye UNK , or see if we can build the heart , we can even look at the heart .
But , of course , because of all those organizations that are very , very difficult , very difficult for the scientist to think of it as a way to think of it as a way to think of it as a way to think of it as a way to think of it as a way to solve a new model of a global problem .
Now , like UNK UNK , a scientist of science , the science of science , and I realized that we were able to collect a lot of things that are not only science imaging , but in this case , in fact , in this case , in addition to UNK and color , we looked at this , and we looked at this , and we looked at this , and we looked at this , and we looked at this , and we looked at this , and we looked at this , and we looked at this , and we looked at this , and we looked at this , and we looked at this , and we looked at this , and we looked at this , and we looked at this , and we looked at this , and we looked at this , and we looked at this , and we looked at this , and we looked at this , and we looked at this , and we looked at this , and we looked at this , and we looked at this , and we looked at this , and we
But something interesting is happening .
You see , in the way , they are moving away from us .
But those waves should be moving forward .
What happened ?
And the result of that is , because we had a little bit of light on the speed of light , Einstein would be very happy to see these images .
And it turns out , sometimes in the camera , sometimes you can fix this , so we can fix this .
So , by looking at the beginning of this , we 're going to take all of the data and we 're going to take all of our data and be able to get all of the data , and we hope that this is the way we 're going to make a lot of data -- this is the way we 're going to talk about UNK -- -- in this case , we 're going to talk about UNK -- -- in the other hand , we 're going to talk about UNK -- -- and start to focus on the other side of the technology .
UNK it . Thank you .
This is the place that I lived in Kenya , in Kenya .
In my background , my father , in the White Valley , was the National Park .
There is no activity in the south of this country , and this is what it means to be like the wild of the wild animals , in the park , in the park .
So , like lions like lions , they are the ones they do .
They killed our crops .
And this is just the cow that died in the night that I was in the morning , and I was dead , because this was my only UNK .
People believe that we are the animals and our home to work with the elephant and our lives and our lives , and this is how we value them .
So I became very UNK about lions .
UNK people are victims of all the time they protect our family and livestock , but they were so frustrated that they were frustrated with this kind of problem .
So they decided to kill these lions .
This is one of those six lions in the world .
I thought that that 's a lot of the bad reason for the world .
In our family , in six years , there were no responsibility to protect their fathers , the same way in my life .
So I had to find a way to figure out .
The first way I thought I 'd be using fire because I knew lions were scared .
But I realized that there was nothing going on , and that helped lions get lions .
But I didn 't have to give up , and I was scared .
So there 's the second solution : UNK .
I 'm going to UNK lions . I 'm standing down on the UNK .
But lions are very clever .
And they saw two days later , and then you go back , but second day , they 're going to be there , and he 's been doing this .
So they 're dancing . They killed animals .
One day , I got a UNK , and on the night , the lions didn 't .
I started to realize that lions will fear light .
So I had an idea .
Because I was a young man , I couldn 't do a lot of a lot of a day in my life , and I even killed my mother 's UNK , and I used to be , in fact , I learned a lot about digital knowledge .
So , I found an old UNK , an UNK , and this is an UNK of all of these small devices that are used to control the UNK of the UNK .
And I found a switch to control the lights of light .
And the light bulb comes from a bad egg .
Everything is ready .
And as you can see , by the way , the solar will give the battery a battery to provide the energy to provide energy , and I call it the " UNK . "
And this is the end of the UNK .
You can see , this is the light bulb , because the lions are coming from here .
This is what it looks like when lions in the end of the night .
And this is the light that makes the lions in the sand , and they thought that I was walking around the UNK , but in fact , in fact , I 'm doing the same thing , in my bed , in my bed .
Thank you .
I spent this device in two years ago , in my family , and we never killed the lion .
My neighbor had heard about this .
One of them is this grandmother .
So there was a whole bunch of eggs that were killed by lions , and she asked if I could help her in her family a little bit like this .
I agree with them .
I took these lights , and you can see this , and this is the UNK light .
So far , I had seven million people in our family community , and they were very useful .
Now , my approach to be saved by Kenya , all of the things in Kenya , like the wind , the UNK , the same as they used to be used to be used to natural elephant from all of our world .
And I was very lucky because it was an opportunity for this invention that was the best school in Kenya -- UNK UNK , and I was very excited about that .
My new school is now going to join and help me increase more money .
I even put my friends to my family , to help them with me in this room with no UNK legs .
A year ago , I was just an UNK man , and I used to look at the average of my dad , and told myself that there were always a day , I would be inside .
Today , I did .
I got an airplane . This is my first time . This is my first time .
So my great dream is : When I grew up , I became an airplane engineer .
I hate it , but now it 's because of my invention that saved my dad and lions and lions .
Thank you very much . UNK : Thank you very much .
You don 't believe that that 's an amazing thing to tell you .
So you 've got an interview . Richard UNK : Yeah .
You 're not going to be an electronic invention ?
What is your next step ?
UNK : My invention is , I 'd like to make a electricity . UNK : electricity ?
UNK : I knew that the electricity had had , but I wanted to make my own one .
You 've tried to do it , you can 't do it , but I stopped , because it UNK me .
You can see this : This is UNK . Richard UNK . You 're going to be different .
We 're going to do every step of every step in the developing world .
Thank you . UNK : Thank you .
I live in Los Angeles .
This is the Los Angeles : UNK UNK , UNK , UNK .
So the way they 're sitting there to talk to you about this , so they 're going to change the name of the Los Angeles , so they 're just going to solve this as an example of this city , like this .
This is the South Los Angeles .
UNK . UNK . UNK . UNK .
In other words , I lived in the water , the Los Angeles , in Los Angeles .
What is interesting is that there are more people to kill people who are dying .
In Los Angeles , they killed the disease .
So , for example , the UNK that I lived in is much more than eight times , more than eight times , more than eight times .
I get tired of these things .
And I 'm thinking , if there is no way to get healthy food , you can see what you see in your family , you see what you feel like , what you feel like , what you feel like , what you feel like , what you feel like , what you feel like , what you feel like , what you feel like , what you feel like , what you feel like , what you feel like , what you feel like , what you feel like , what you feel like , what you feel like , what you feel like , what you feel like , what you feel like , what you feel like , what you feel like , what you feel like , what you feel like , what you feel like , what you feel like , what you feel like , what you feel like , what you feel like , what you feel like , what you feel like , what you feel like , what you feel like , what you feel like , what you feel like , what you feel like , what you feel
I see a wheelchair like a UNK car .
I see the UNK centers like UNK .
I don 't think that 's going to happen .
I think the answer is hidden .
food is the problem . Food is the solution .
Again , I was tired of UNK , waiting for 45 minutes .
So , by the way , in my house , I was in my house .
And this is the place that we call it in the park .
150 feet over 10 feet .
UNK the government is there .
But there 's always a way to maintain it .
And so I thought , " Yeah ! This is my responsibility , I 've got to keep it , so I want to do something about that . "
This is why I 'm going to keep doing it .
So , with my team , " UNK UNK , we got together to grow their food forest , UNK , nine million vegetables .
We are a free organization , and we made a free group of different cities . You are all volunteers . We are all done . We are all done .
The garden was very beautiful .
But very quickly .
And the government told me that I had to make my garden , and I thought , " UNK to be the warning of the UNK . "
I thought , " What kind of UNK ?
You can 't care about it with the tree of the tree .
And I thought , " UNK . "
Because it didn 't happen .
So , in Los Angeles , he wrote a story about this story and a UNK and a green group that they were going to talk about it , and they were able to get the UNK sign , and we were successful .
We are successful in our hands .
UNK came to visit and say , " How could he feel like love to love us ? "
I mean , of course , how can they do that ?
In Los Angeles , the number of UNK in Los Angeles is in the middle of the United States .
It has a UNK space .
So this is 20 Central Park .
There are enough space to grow the water of UNK .
Why do they feel bad ?
A tree can receive 1,000 , and even 10,000 seeds .
You can see 75 million dollars in your town .
This is my art , and I tell people , " You can 't eat your food . "
The food is like the control of the money .
So , in Los Angeles , I had a foundation .
I grew up in there , and I grew up in my son .
I refused to be part of what I 'd like to build my own reality .
Well , I 'm an artist .
UNK is my blog , and I created my art .
It 's like the artist artist , they 're UNK . And I 'm UNK , UNK .
I took the garden and the land , and plants and trees are my UNK .
You can see what it was like to be able to do this , and you think of it as your canvas .
You can 't imagine how amazing it can be , and it will be affected by people .
What 's going to happen ?
I saw the tools of my garden and became the tools of my community .
In order to change the community , you need to change the soil .
We are the soil .
You will be surprised by how the child will be affected .
UNK is the most powerful act of UNK and challenging and challenging the entire act , especially in the Mall .
You get UNK .
I remember , a mother and daughter , like the UNK of the night 10 years ago , when I saw them , they were very , very embarrassing .
And they were going to make me feel bad , and I told them that you didn 't like to get food .
This is the cause of the street .
And when I see people who are hungry , this makes me feel very much . This is what I do . You don 't want to kill you for food ? "
And I said , " Of course , I 'm afraid , " Of course , I 'm afraid , people will kill it .
And that 's why it 's happening in the streets .
That 's what I want .
I 'm going to take it for it , but at the same time , I hope that we 'll be able to save the body 's body . "
Again , when I was a hospital in the UNK center , a garden .
These guys have helped me get UNK .
And this is so cool , and they share their stories , how they interact with their mother and their mothers and their mothers , and they can change them . It can only be a very cool thing to do , just for this moment .
And the green sector will be 20 garden .
We have about 50 people to participate in our team , and they are volunteers .
You can eat UNK if they 're going to grow their lives .
And if they grow , they 're going to eat the body .
But when these people are not going to be able to do their faces , if they weren 't able to have a food and their body , they just don 't have to eat any food that they eat in front of their own food .
I see young people who were trying to work , but they were very interested in this thing , and I saw different colors , and they used to work on their way to work for them , and this path was not the same way .
When you take the walls , I discovered an opportunity that we can train these kids to spend their communities in their communities , in a very sustainable way .
When we do this , we knew that we would be going to do that .
UNK Washington in Washington .
But if we couldn 't change the soil , we never did .
This led to my plan . This is what I 'd like to do .
I 'd like to share this with a whole bunch of UNK that are able to share food .
I 'd like to turn the shipping to the UNK of the health of the health .
Don 't get it wrong .
I didn 't think free , because free .
But the interesting thing about sustainability is that you have to keep it .
And so what I 'm talking about is people to get their jobs from the streets , to get them to learn their joy , to honor and to be , in the same way .
So what I 'd like to do is try to make this plan more attractive .
I 'm going to be able to be the UNK of the environment , the UNK , the UNK .
We 're going to get the definition of UNK .
If you 're not a UNK , you 're not a gold .
What happens when you take a UNK ?
UNK to become a weapon that makes you be free .
Basically , if you 're going to see me , if you 're going to get to see , if you 're going to sit on your comfort chair , I would like to call some of these things that didn 't get me .
If you want to see me , I 'm going to go to the garden with this thing , and this is what we can do .
Come on . Thank you .
Thank you .
By 2011 , I was an image of photography , in New York City .
We were UNK , UNK .
We always stayed in the middle of the dark , in the middle of the UNK , the studio , not the windows , mostly for the sun .
And the model that we gave UNK , to be more UNK , to be more UNK , to be able to be the world that we were all in the media , but in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in history , in fact , in fact , in fact , in history , in fact , in fact , in history , in fact , in history , in fact , in history , in fact , in history , in fact , in this case , in fact , in history , in fact , in history , in fact , in this case , in fact , in history , in fact , in this case , in fact , in history , in fact , in this case , in fact , in history , in fact , in this case , in fact , in history , in fact , in this case , in fact , in history , in fact , in this case , in fact , in history , in fact , in history , in history ,
In 2009 , like the world , I saw in Japan , and I saw it in Japan .
Later , I went to a group of volunteers , and the team came to be on the world , and only in the last couple of days , in the middle of the world .
I didn 't really care about volunteers . So I decided to join them up , so I decided to join them for three weeks .
In May I went to Japanese UNK , India .
So this is a small village in Japan , and it 's about 50,000 people , and that was the first place of the epidemic .
In the end of the tsunami , in the end of the UNK , we had two miles .
You can imagine , in this town , in this town , in this town .
We UNK the UNK and the UNK .
We were able to help school and those UNK houses , by UNK , UNK .
We cleaned a huge amount of UNK , UNK UNK , all those fish in the local factory .
We were getting too hot , but we were very UNK .
For a few weeks , all of these volunteers and all of the people were getting similar things like that .
And they were able to find this picture , UNK , UNK and UNK .
Everybody else respond to the act of action .
And they collect these pictures , and they send them to UNK .
Now , I realized that there was no big part of these people .
And when they were suffering from the tsunami , you see , " UNK , " or " UNK , " and all the things on the brain .
I was in the first week of last week in Japan , and I found myself in a UNK center .
UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK .
And the UNK center is collecting people dying .
People sent the photo to the UNK , and I was very lucky to get their trust , to get my way down , to get those pictures .
And , by the way , very inspiring , I 've heard about people saying , " You 've got to be creative ! You can 't really work on it . "
When I got to look at these pictures , some of these UNK of history , some of them were not only in the lab , some of the time that I could be able to be able to be able to be able to UNK them to be used by UNK and UNK , and I also know that many of these are going to help them with these pictures .
So , at the end of the day , I went on Facebook and asked some of these things , like a few days in the morning , and there were so much of the news that they were willing to help , and I knew that we should be doing that .
And so we started this map .
This is an image of what we did .
It wasn 't so bad that it was so bad that it was very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very precise , to be able to UNK the face of a UNK , and we had to UNK , and we had to be very precise , we had to be able to fix it . It was very precise .
Otherwise , a girl 's face doesn 't look like the face of her face -- so much tragic , like the UNK .
And over time , more and more of the images that we were able to help to deal with these pictures , we had to spend more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more of the people who were trying to help , to help , to help them , to give us a bunch of things that they were going to help to help , and they come from 12 different countries .
Two weeks , I had 150 volunteers , and they 'd like to join us .
So , in Japan , in Japan , we built a bunch of other UNK , UNK , UNK and UNK .
Every week , we were able to scan devices in the last week , and people would come back to their photos , and they came home to them .
Some of the older women who never saw the page , they were able to take pictures , and they were able to take pictures of their lives , and they were able to take photos on the screen , and they were able to be UNK , or strangers , they could be applied to the other end of the world , and they could be applied to the top of the world .
And yet , they had to spend the same time , and , of course , you see , in fact , it depends on the quality of the brain .
This is the case of an hour that could be used for a few weeks .
A few months .
And the beautiful UNK must be able to deal with the hand , or the color of the hand , and the color of the color , to make the details of the water .
The whole process is very efficient .
All of these were affected by the UNK , in the UNK , in the trash , in the trash , and in the trash , in this case , by the way , the whole thing was the big part of the program that this program was a big part of the program .
And if they weren 't going to be clean , we couldn 't fix it , we had to be able to work . You had to work .
So this is very , very good for us .
There is a woman who UNK us .
These pictures are easy , very easily .
As my team UNK , I mean , this is just like UNK .
You can 't get any of it . You can make a mess .
And this is very lucky to tell us that this is very lucky . This is very , very lucky .
She started off with her UNK , until she realized that she had more damage to the image of her .
Well , there was a picture of the UNK .
Otherwise , in this picture , her face was not complete , so we were able to make all the parts to make this picture together .
When she came out of this picture , she shared some of these pictures .
This photo was actually made out of her father , in the middle of her husband , in the middle of the world where they were -- and they were -- by the way , they were -- by the way , they were -- by the way , they were -- by the way , they were -- by the way , they were -- by the way , they were -- by the way , they were -- by the way , they were -- by the way , they were -- by the way , they were -- by the way , they were -- by the way , they were -- by the way , they were -- by the way , they were -- by the way , they were -- by the way , they were -- by the way , they were -- by the way , they were -- by the way , they were -- by the way , they were -- by the way , they were -- by the way , they were -- by the way , they were -- by the way , they were -- they
In the end of the tsunami , he 's responsible to make sure the tsunami of the tsunami .
By the way , he had to jump to the tsunami .
Her two sons , although not too much , had two different schools to school .
One of the children in the world was destroyed by the tsunami .
She took an entire week of UNK , and they were all dead .
And she gave her an image of her son , and she was like 14 years old .
And for her , despite the fact that all of the last UNK of his life will be the best gift , the photo of his son , and the fact that no three months of his life will leave his life , and he killed all the things that he was going to do , and when he lived in his life , he would be lost .
Six months later , in Japan , the volunteers were UNK , and hundreds of volunteers , hundreds of thousands of people in Japan , hundreds of thousands of people .
Most of the end , in fact , very important .
More than 500 million volunteers have been removed hundreds of thousands of these pictures , all of these pictures , by UNK , UNK .
And in this case , we never had the cost of the device , for millions of dollars .
We used to be able to take pictures .
This is a hint of UNK and UNK , and I remind us some of these things , like , in some cases , in a way , in a way , in a way , in a way , in a way , in a way , in a way , in a way .
They 're helping us record and UNK and UNK , and this is the easiest moment in the world , but sometimes when we first think of what we 're going to get back .
So this is the work of this program , in order to get a little bit of small pieces of people in the world .
And when it comes to this picture , it will be very large , very different to the quality of life .
And this program is very powerful for us to build this program .
In some ways , this is the connection that they built , and the combination of things , like feedback , the skills that they can 't be used to , like the UNK of UNK , of UNK , of UNK , of UNK , of UNK .
I 'd like to give you a letter email , and I got a letter from " UNK , " which was six months later , and I came home from Japan .
And when I UNK those pictures , I would like to share the stories that are in the photo .
And one of the young women in this room , on this little girl , did this very small baby , because my family had an image of my grandmother , my mother and my mother , and I was on the wall of my apartment , and this photo went down to my home .
So , in the world , beyond the age of age , we have the most fundamental need to be no longer , no , no ? "
Thank you .
Today , I 'd like to talk about a terrible question , which is the same answer as well .
I 'm talking about the secret of poverty , and I 'm going to answer this question , " Why do you do that ? "
" How could anyone be willing to live with her man ? "
I 'm not UNK , UNK , UNK experts .
I 'm just a woman who has a personal experience to tell about .
I was 22 years old , and I graduated from Harvard College .
I moved to New York City , and started the first job in " The UNK " by UNK .
I had the first driver . I had a big secret .
And this secret was the secret that I thought I 'd like to live in my soul with a lot of other people .
This is my favorite person who was UNK me , and I never knew how many times I did .
And now I 'm going to tell you the story of this : " UNK of love , " which is millions of women in love a million years , or even other men , including other men .
Perhaps it 's happening in front of you .
I don 't look like a typical family victim .
I got a Ph.D. in Harvard School of Harvard School , and I got a UNK degree in the UNK business industry .
Most of my time , I spent most of the time , the company of UNK , of UNK , UNK and Washington .
My second day , I married my second , was 20 children and three children .
I got a black UNK , UNK UNK .
And this is what I 'm going to tell you about , " UNK can 't keep you in every single person who don 't have any of your race or education or education or education .
It 's everywhere .
The second truth that I 'm going to talk about is that many people think that it is the case of women in women who are women .
No .
More than 70 percent of all the people in this country , in the same way , in the same way , in the same way , in the family , in the same way , in the family , in the same way , in the family , in the same case , in the family , in the same case , in the family , in the same case , in the family of the family .
I thought there were only one in the world that I had spent my last time , but in fact , in this case , in this case , this is very , very common .
I was 22 years old , and 16 percent of women in the United States had more than two times , and in the United States , more than 500 women or girls die , were killed by people who were killed , or her husband .
I 'm a very typical victim , because I didn 't really care about the power of my life .
I met UNK , in fact , nine years old , day very cold .
We got here in New York City , and he spoke to me .
He told me two things .
One of the first is he graduated from UNK , and in a very good Wall Street .
But first of all , to meet the most surprising , to my father , he looked like a farm boy .
His face was like a big UNK , like the UNK of the UNK .
In the case of UNK , the smartest thing to do -- let me believe that in this sense , in this respect .
In particular , he made me think that I was an actor .
So , we started talking , and he likes to tell me , for example , my clever , my career in Harvard , and my job .
He wanted to know my childhood , my wish .
UNK UNK me , in my sense , like a woman and a woman who never didn 't have any other people .
And by the way that he was extraordinary , he was able to get all the time in the world , and he told me that he was going to run in the same early ' 60s , so that he had to be able to kill him at eight years , because he took 20 years to be able to rebuild his life , although he had no 20 years to rebuild his life .
And that 's why -- this is the case of UNK , the world 's work in Wall Street , in order to be significant .
And if there were a day for me to ask the fact that I had a lot of a day , I would like to make sure that there was a lot of other things that my friends and my friends and in this room would be , like , " How hard can we be in this room to be able to help you or not , because I don 't know any of these things , because I don 't see any of the bad or UNK or UNK . "
I didn 't know that it was the first step of violence and the UNK , the first step of poverty .
I didn 't know that second step was isolated .
Not to go back home , but I 'm going to get to the stage for the fact that I 'm going to leave you in the world , but I 'm going to leave you with the stage -- so I 'm going to leave you with the whole apartment , so I 'm going to leave you with your apartment and save your neighbor , so I 'm going to leave you to leave you with your friends and your friends and your family , and you 'll see your UNK . "
And the fact that he came home for a Friday night , and he told me that he wasn 't going to be good for him , and he said he 'd never let us -- and he would only leave the city , and so he just wanted to leave the city , so that he would just leave the city in the city , and that he would just leave the town in the town and in the town and in New England , and I started working on this new life in New England , and I started working on this new life in New England .
At the time , I wanted to leave New York to leave New York to leave my job , but to my soul , I thought I needed to get paid . And so I agreed to quit , and I got a job .
I thought there was crazy love , and I didn 't know what was going to be the control of the control of your body , the UNK of your body and the economy .
And the third phase of violence is the beginning of the violence .
This is what I did .
So , we just moved to New England town -- I thought , " UNK must be -- this is safe -- he bought three guns . "
You put in your car box .
You put it on the bed , and then the third half is always in the pocket .
And he said , " You know he needed to have these guns . "
And let him keep his own .
And the gun was an obvious signal , although he didn 't have a gun , and I didn 't see if I didn 't see the edge of the danger .
UNK was the first time that we were in the morning of five days ago .
So , in this morning , I was wearing UNK .
I 'm working on the computer , and I had my courage , Dr. UNK UNK , who was my anger , Dr. UNK , who I couldn 't breathe , because he came down with his chest , and he took my leg and hit the wall to the wall .
Five days after all , in my chest , I sat on my mom 's lap , and I was married .
And despite all of these things , I believe that we can be happy , because there is so much love .
And he 's very , very UNK of all of it .
He 's just too much -- he got his wife and I had to leave him for him .
This was an accident , and he never got to hurt me .
I had two times in the same time .
For the first time , I went to looking for a secret for the secret , and I was lost , so I was not going to stop having my head on the UNK on the table , so I 'd never had a glass that I could not get down to my head .
Nobody , for the course of the day of UNK to drive home , he gave him a very cold -- he had to be a terrible version of my face in my face .
Within the last two years , I had spent two years .
I 've had a person who had never come to be there .
In fact , in three American women , in the end of the world , the dominant act of UNK percent of all the children were killed , 15 million children .
So , in fact , I 'm not the case .
Back to my question , " Why do I leave this ?
And the answer is very simple .
I didn 't know he was UNK me .
And even though he UNK the gun to my head , to kill the UNK , to kill the UNK of the UNK , we never thought of myself as a UNK for my first time .
By the way , I 'm a very clever woman named UNK men who were so sick and I was the only person in the world that helps to help Dr. UNK a man .
And the question is , " Why don 't we leave ? "
Why not ? I had a lot of opportunities .
And for me , this is the most powerful thing that people ask me , you can 't understand it , but only the victims of our victims .
Because in the last part of the family violence .
More than 70 percent of the families in the victims of the victims , after she died , because of UNK .
Other results , even more of all the time , not to protect the economy to protect the victims of the victims of the family , to their children , the children who were going to be a woman who was going to vote with a woman who would not be treated with the family .
Now we still ask , why don 't we stay ?
And I decided to leave , because there was a big way of UNK that came out of the limits .
I realized that if I didn 't fight that , this would have been killed me .
So I broke silence .
I 'm going to tell you , " UNK , my friends and family , and I 'm standing here , because everyone helped me . "
We tend to UNK the victims of UNK , like the gods in the news .
" Why are she going to leave ? "
And the people who are saying , " This is her , like the victim of UNK , UNK , UNK .
But UNK -- they were published on this book , many men and women who were trying to tell them , and they went to school , and they started to live a lot of time , and they started to work on their lives , and they were getting happier -- like my life , my life , my life , like a family , my life , to live like violence .
In fact , I 'm an example of a typical family , a typical family survivor .
I was married with a UNK , and there were three children .
I got a black UNK , UNK UNK .
And I will never even ever have to be , never be the mouth that I like to use my UNK to UNK the gun to my head .
Now , you 're thinking , oh , this is amazing , or , oh , " Oh , " but in the whole process , in fact , I 'm talking about you .
I 'm sure that there are people who are listening to people who are suffering , or have been killed before , or if you 're a young person .
You 're going to be in your daughter , and it 's your best friend . You are the best friend .
I can go on the last song , which is the end of a silence .
I 'm still going to be silent . "
This is the way I helped other victims , and also I 'm going to talk to you about that .
Tell somebody you hear about that today .
UNK can only live in silence .
You have the capacity to stop the family of the family .
We need to be able to help everybody .
We need the secret to everybody in your life .
And your child , your colleagues , your friends and talk about this subject , will kill the light .
UNK UNK and cute and cute , and UNK the future .
And the victims of the violence , in terms of the risk , to reduce the potential of their victims , to the victims of the victims .
Let 's get rid of bed . We can live in the bed and family to be the safe and peace of our family .
Thank you .
When I was a kid , I thought my country was the best of the world , and I got a song called " UNK . "
I feel proud .
In school , we had a lot of time to learn about UNK history , but we never knew so much about the world -- except in the United States and Japan and Japan .
I didn 't expect the world to be outside the world , and I thought I 'd spent my life in North Korea , until all of all , all of the things .
When I was seven years old , I was the first UNK , but I thought I was very normal in North Korea .
My family wasn 't poor . And I never had no experience .
But in 1995 , my mom took a letter to go home to send her parents .
And he wrote , " When you read this letter , my family will leave the day because we lived two weeks .
Now we are all in the floor , and our body is too rich for all of us . You 're ready . "
I was very surprised .
And that 's the first thing that I heard about life in my country .
And soon after that , after I walked in an UNK , I saw a very , very bad thing to make sure .
And the woman in the room is lying on the ground , and there was a huge child , and this kid would be UNK by the face of his mother 's face .
But no one can help them , because you can 't do it with your family .
In the ' 90s , North Korea had a terrible famine .
Unfortunately , over a million of seven million people dying in famine . And many of them were living in the water , the insects and the UNK .
And the power is getting so much more often than the night , all of the time around the night , except for China , only by the river of China .
I used to think about why they had UNK , and we didn 't .
This is a map of the night north of North Korea and around the world .
This is UNK . As China and North Korea .
As you can see , this river is very moving in certain places where they can take the Chinese to China .
But a lot of the people who were trying to die were dead .
Sometimes I see the body UNK .
I couldn 't get too much of the details of North Korea , but I had to say that this was the hardest number of years that I was sent to China and in China .
I thought I was just a very short of my family .
But I never thought about 14 years ago .
In China , I had a lot of girls .
I don 't know how much of the rest of my life in North Korea , but I 'm very quickly aware that life was not too much , and even more dangerous because of North America , because in China , in China , in China .
So I always lived in fear , I fear that my identity will be discovered , and I will go back to North Korea to get the worst destiny .
One day , my worst name was true , I was UNK by the Chinese police to police the Internet .
Some of them were UNK me , and they tested my life , and they asked me a lot of questions .
I was in UNK , and I was feeling that my heart was going to be UNK .
If any of you , I would not be able to get back and get back .
I thought I 'd finished this life . But I 'm trying to hide my fears and anxiety and answer them .
By the way , a police said , " The report is wrong .
She 's not North Carolina . "
And they took me . It was a miracle .
Some of the North China went to UNK in China , and they were killed by the Chinese police to go back to North Korea .
These girls are lucky .
Even though they were caught , they were able to get the gold of the International to release them .
But there were a lot of dragonflies .
More than 90 percent of all the time in China were arrested , and went back to North Korea , or killed .
Even though I 'm lucky enough to get out of North Korea , I didn 't have good luck .
And this is a very sad fact , which is the same for the North , so that it was very hard to be able to survive .
Even they learned about the Chinese , and they found the world , and the world will be UNK .
And this is why , in UNK 10 years , I decided to get more than Korea . And so I had a new life .
In Korea , much more difficult than I imagine it was a challenge .
English is very important in Korea , so I had to start learning the third language -- English .
And I realized that there were huge differences in North Korea .
Even though we were all bad , we were very different because of UNK .
I even experienced the question of self .
Am out Korean or North Korea ?
Where do I come from ? What am I ?
Suddenly , I didn 't have to be proud of all the countries that have my own country .
Even though it wasn 't good for Korea , but I decided .
UNK UNK .
By the beginning of the beginning , I got an amazing phone .
And in the North government , I sent home from home , and , as punishment , my family had to be UNK and moved to a remote place in the remote places .
They had to get off , so I started to help them .
UNK the road path to the freedom of freedom .
You 're going to think about the border between North Korea and South Korea , so , very ironic , very , very , very , very clear to China and then went to the border border .
Because my family didn 't know the Chinese , so I had to help them with about 2,000 kilometers in China .
We had spent a week on the bus for several hours .
Again , we sat on a bus with a Chinese officer .
He looked at each other man . He started UNK .
Because my family didn 't feel like the Chinese , I was afraid they were caught .
So , when the Chinese officer went down to me , I would like to tell him that this is a bunch of UNK , and I 'm the ones .
He looked at me , but fortunately , he believed .
And so we moved to UNK , but I 'm going to spend light every day to save the border of UNK .
And even though we got the same family , my family was UNK .
After all the money that I did , my family were released , but after that , they were caught by the capital of the UNK .
And this is one of the moments of my life .
I 've been free to make my family , by the way , in the end of the day , the family and the prison of North Korea .
I spent a lot of time in UNK and UNK , UNK UNK , hoping that we could save them , but I didn 't have enough money to bribe or UNK .
I 'm UNK .
In this case , I heard one person asked me , " How ? "
I mean , I 'm an UNK , and a complete stranger . UNK .
I used to use the English language to speak to the dictionary , by the way , to UNK the UNK , to my family and the other UNK in the middle of the world .
I really appreciate that he said , " Why do you help me help me ? "
" I 'm not going to help you , " he said .
" I 'm helping the people in North Korea . "
And I realized that that was a moment of my life .
The joy of strangers in the face of all the hope that I had , my hope , he made me understand that strangers and international society would be the hope that we had hope that we needed .
And eventually , in a long time , I was in Korea , and I was born in Korea , and I got 50 percent of the time .
Many of all the bees and their families and their families , they are only less money , and they usually get a very low amount of money , or a small amount of money .
So we can help with international education to help education , English training , etc . .
We can be able to communicate with the relationship between the world and the people in North Korea , because we all live in the same family in North Korea , and we were able to get back and help in North Korea .
I was so lucky that there was so much more helpful to help in my life , so I wanted to help all of the women in the international aid to international aid , an opportunity to dream about dreams .
I have the confidence that you 'll see more and more and more of the world 's good news , including this stage .
Thank you .
You may agree with that . This is good .
It 's a good material . It 's a very good material , and it 's going to be very good , very , very , very , very similar to this , like today , in the weather , like this .
In UNK , there were a lot of water going on .
Especially if you 're on a bicycle , and you 're not going to get too good at that .
And the UNK is going to be huge noise .
And the material is a little bit , if we were going to build the city , like the Dutch road , we 'd like to get some of the noise .
And the way to deal with it is to be the UNK of the UNK .
So this material is the material that had a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the water that would be in the last 20 years , and the cars will be free , and no longer UNK .
UNK will disappear in all these types .
Because there 's a lot of UNK , and they UNK the noise , so they 're quiet .
And of course , this is the heart of the UNK , which of course , the UNK of the UNK .
What is UNK ? You look at the stone down .
I 'm going to do this for a few , and more and more and more -- -- I just don 't show it .
But they will not be happy if you 're not happy . You 're not happy .
And finally , there will be a lot of damage to that .
You 'll see that in fact , in the end of the road .
Ah , he was early years old .
Of course , the problem of course , of course , is the solution . But we have the solutions .
So this is the control of the material you see here .
This is the roof , like I said , the UNK of rock .
And because of the UNK , the UNK , the reason it UNK , this is the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , from UNK to UNK .
And if you drive in this road , you 'd like to see this , and this is what we see .
In order to fix this , we think we can fix the material .
And if we can make this material , we might have the solutions .
So , by the way , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the small ones , the UNK .
So there are a few of them right there .
You need a machine that looks like this . You can cook it .
UNK can be hot . It 's good for steel .
So what we 're going to do is we take the steel hot , we put the gold down , the gold will get the heat down , and the eggs will be cut .
And because of all the things that are too good , I 'm going to show you a little demo here .
UNK is very similar to the UNK .
I 'm going to put it down , and I 'm going to pick it up , and see what happens .
This is what it looks like today .
We had UNK machines in the lab .
We had a lot of samples , and they looked at our results , and they decided , " This is interesting , we should try . "
And the government UNK , for example , 400 meters from the top , and we made materials tests .
And this is what we did . You see , because this is not bad for years , and that 's why we UNK it .
We took a lot of samples in this way , in the lab .
So we did a lot of things , and we added a lot of UNK , and we UNK them down , and they heat down and test .
We can repeat that over time .
And in fact , if we weren 't good at this , we could use this to be the heat machine -- the UNK UNK , which we had a lot of money to get -- in fact , a lot of money in this case -- in this case , in the end of the world .
So , by the way , we made the material that we built with steel , and UNK the chemicals that would be more expensive for the speed of the day to build a lot of money in this very simple way .
You wonder if you 're going to be effective .
Here we see this , and here we are .
In fact , I 'm going to make it so slow down so that you can 't be able to repair it .
But think about that .
You see , this is UNK .
Thank you .
I 'd like to talk to you about a very unusual animal .
There are 10,000 birds in the world .
UNK is the most fundamental thing that they had in the last world .
You see , in fact , in this case , first of all , in your mind , this is some of the UNK , the terrible creature in the UNK , in the UNK of UNK .
I want to change that . I want to change the bad ideas that you 're talking about -- because they need our compassion . They really need to be .
Let me tell you why .
First of all , why are they going to leave us with the bad news ?
Charles Darwin , Charles Darwin , in the course of the Atlantic Ocean , discovered Turkey , and he said , " These are the UNK of white birds in UNK of UNK .
You 're very hard to find more harmful than that , in fact , Charles Darwin .
You know , Darwin is going to change his thoughts , and I 'll tell you why .
UNK -- like George UNK -- like UNK , by the way , into the UNK , the UNK .
And recently recently , if you 've noticed the news for Kenya -- -- because of the UNK of Congress -- Congress -- -- I think , " UNK . " " But I 'm going to UNK it . "
I 'm going to question it . You know why ?
Because Congress couldn 't keep the force clean .
You can 't stop the disease .
Almost nothing to follow .
And they were so far away .
And this is my favorite , UNK UNK .
In this world , there are two types of people in this world .
And the main majority of the world is growing in the United States , like UNK and UNK , in other parts of the year , there are four risks that they are facing the risks of smallpox .
So , why is it so important ? First of all , this is an important role to the ecosystem . And they break the environment .
UNK UNK is the UNK of our nature .
And they eat UNK percent of the meat that they eat .
And they can kill all the bacteria that they prevent the virus of the virus to prevent the virus to the virus , to reduce the disease and the disease of the disease .
And the study of research recently has spent three times as much as much as possible to four times as much as possible as possible transmission .
UNK has a lot of history .
And they had a common connection with the Egyptian .
UNK UNK , in the middle of the West , the UNK and the UNK , usually the UNK and UNK in Egypt , in Egypt and in Egypt .
In the middle of the West , the UNK of the UNK , who had no power to live in the face of 10 , to save the face of the West .
In Tibet culture , particularly important -- in this case , in between Tibet , in those places , in this case they weren 't moving out , there was no natural bodies to build a natural body , so that they gave them a natural body to do the same kind of natural body .
So the question is , what is the problem ?
Kenya is eight , and six of them are extinct .
Many of the reasons , the reason it is , because in Kenya , in this country , between humans and wildlife -- all the other animals , the UNK of the wildlife , the UNK , the UNK -- the UNK -- the UNK -- the UNK of the animals .
In South Asia , in India and in India , four forms of smallpox were destroyed by the fact that they were going to be lost -- in the last 10 years , the result of the fact that they killed less than seven percent of the people that killed them .
There are now UNK in India , in India , in India , in India .
Because the UNK of the number of people in the wild world , in UNK , in UNK areas like UNK , the number of UNK in India , in India , in the end of the India .
Kenya is going to be part of the world 's largest wind plant : the UNK engine .
I don 't care about the wind , but we should be able to call the government to think about it , because the wind estimates of birds had the threat of bird flu .
These are the birds of birds .
In West Africa , some of the people who don 't have compassion to die for the fact that they don 't get the right thing to do the difference between the UNK and the collection .
What are we going to do ? We 're looking at UNK .
We 're trying to figure out how to deal with the relationship between the world .
And we found that they were going to travel across different countries , so that if you were to focus on an area , you 'd be very hard to figure out what was going on .
We need to work with the governments in the world .
We 're trying to communicate with local people .
We are trying to figure out how to deal with the benefits of UNK , and to be able to attract all of these fantastic creatures and to the natural nature .
What do you do ? You can act . You can write to the government and tell them that we need to figure out how to deal with these people who are bad , and to tell them how to do it .
When you walk across this room , you can 't tell you that you 're not going to tell your family and you 're going to tell your neighbors about UNK .
And they were , in fact , Charles Darwin said that he changed his own view , and he saw UNK in the air .
In Kenya , the world will be very large , and there will be a lot of money to lose this amazing species .
Thank you very much .
You can get so many ways we can make life better .
We 're not sure we can keep our neighbors , so even if we live in the same kind of relationship between the people in the public space .
So , in the last few years , I tried to work with different ways of using different forms of UNK , UNK and UNK , and simple tools to share more things in public spaces .
These projects came out of me , and like my neighbor , how much do I pay ?
How can we treat each other and be able to avoid another person in the middle ?
How can we share the sense of the building and the UNK of the building so that we live in this land ?
How can we tell us about the people who are going to express our community to be able to convey the world and dreams that are going to be going to respond to us today ?
I lived in New Orleans and deep in this new city .
And those who had all the gold that had always been able to help my soul for hundreds of years , UNK and UNK , and people like UNK , who are very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very good for the city of the music .
Every time I feel , I feel like this , in fact , a UNK .
New Orleans , the most beautiful buildings in the world , but she also has the most of the world of buildings in the world .
I was in this room , and I thought it was going to be a better place to think about this entire world , and I think there really change my life .
In 2009 , I lost my love .
Her name was UNK , and she was like my mother , and she was like , she never expected it .
And I thought a lot about dying of death , and I thought , " Well , I 'm going to tell you a lot of other things about my life , and I 'm going to see what 's going on in my life , and I 'm going to see what 's going on in my life . "
But I 'm very , very , very , very difficult to keep in our daily life .
I think it 's too easy to get out of a lot of bad things that never really matters .
And I made a big sign of the wall that I wrote on the wall , and I wrote a whole bunch of UNK , and I used to pick up a wall that would leave some of them in the public to share some of them in the public to share their dreams , to share their wishes .
I didn 't know what was going on in this experiment , but the second day , all the walls were filled with no way to add new answers .
I 'd like to share some of these people on the wall .
I thought , " Well , I 'd like to die for my UNK . "
" Before you die , I 'd like to go for the International date . "
" Before you die , I 'd like to sing in a million audience . "
" Before you die , I 'd like a tree . "
" Before you die , I 'd like to get a UNK . "
" Before you die , I 'd like to leave her again . "
" Before you die , I 'd like to be a guy . "
" Before you die , I 'd like to do something very true . "
This was a very UNK building , which was the hope that my dreams and all my dreams , to my dreams , to UNK me .
This is how we believe ourselves .
Let us tell you a little bit about the act of UNK .
And this is an example of how we create and thinking about what 's going on in the process that we are changing .
And this is what I did last year , and I got some of these passions to my students , so I made a small tool that my colleagues and my colleagues built around the world , like in the world , in South America , in South America .
These signs are showing that if we could have a way to share the opportunities and share the opportunity to share the public space .
This is the most powerful thing that we have . It 's time , and there 's another connection between other people .
In this case , in the middle of this world , people will not be much more important than any of the most vulnerable of life .
We always had no courage to talk about death , and there was no courage to go to death , but I realized that there was a very powerful thing to get to die .
Think about death can make you feel more aware of your life .
The public space will be much more important for us to share the same way that we 're going to be able to help us to share things that are not going to be able to help us not be able to help us to create better places to help us better lives .
Thank you .
Thank you .
I spent 50 meters deep in Ghana .
The air is very hard to breathe , and it 's very hard to breathe .
I can feel " UNK , " I can 't see other things , but in a dark , I don 't see anything else .
I 've heard about the sound of people talking , but more of it , like UNK , with the sound of the stone tools .
In other words , my head took off the cheap cheap and UNK in the chest , and I UNK the metal of the walls of the wall , and they were able to support it with hundreds of miles of water to the wall .
I put this up on the front of the day , and immediately came up with a UNK , and he UNK the UNK .
When I 'm standing here talking to you about this , in this case , in this room , in this field , in this field , no more , no , no more expensive .
I ended up in the middle of this room to go home , and those who were never going to die for the day that would never get home .
I 've spent my last year in the last 28 years , and I spent seven countries in 2009 , and in 2009 , I was very , very , very , very , very , very , very good for the UNK of UNK .
And there I met a lot of amazing people who were -- in fact , the UNK of UNK , the UNK of the UNK of modern society .
And so we talked about UNK , and I started to really know about the reality of the world , although I didn 't really know what was going on in the world , but I didn 't really know what was going on .
By the end of our conversation , I feel terrible , and I don 't know how many other people don 't know , but I don 't know how many of you don 't know ?
And this idea is that I 'm going to go to the last couple of weeks I 'm going to go to Los Angeles to see this UNK , " UNK of UNK . "
So this started the journey of my modern world .
So , in fact , those are the places that are going on .
Some of them were , I thought , to be the second part of my second .
But this , I 'm going to get to see the secret to see the secret .
There are more than three million people in the world today .
So this is the number of two times in the world trade from Africa .
150 years ago , the price of UNK was three times more likely to have three times .
This is just about 50,000 dollars a year .
But in this case , the cost of a family would be only 18 dollars a year .
And the amazing thing about it is , in the world it 's more than two million dollars a year .
Many of us are UNK by the UNK , and there are good things that are good for good education , good enough to get rid of it . And we can 't get rid of it .
Now this is an act of commercial goods that are valuable to create value , but creating the value of people who are being treated by the way .
There are almost every corner in the world , even if they 're illegal .
In India and in India , I was in the UNK .
And the interesting thing about this is , like walking in the middle of Egypt , or UNK .
You see , in 50 degrees centigrade , women , a whole family -- a UNK of all the electricity on the ground , and every single one of them UNK the wire to the ground , and by the way , two meters away from the truck .
UNK and tired , they were quiet , and they were 16 , and the same half of them were 16 years old to 17 years old .
You can 't get it . You can 't eat it . You don 't have a toilet .
Because of all the hot water and the windows I couldn 't be able to do that , I couldn 't do it .
Every 20 minutes I had to go on the car , and let it go down on the air , and I 'm going to give you a car , and I 'm going to go on the car and I 'm going to spend on the car , and you 're going to be much better than those who are going to be much better than that .
So , back to UNK , I couldn 't really get to cry , but by the way , the UNK and the UNK . Don 't cry .
And he explained to me that their emotions are very dangerous for the fact that they are dangerous to me .
I couldn 't give them any direct help .
I can 't give them money . I 'll give them my money .
I 'm not going to be the citizen .
I think it 's possible to make them worse than worse .
I can only expect them to UNK them in the system , and I believe they can do it .
So , I had to wait for the first time .
In the middle , I saw the kids in the UNK store to the rock with a few kilometers of miles on the back of the street .
And those big things are much more likely to spend the children and the UNK and the UNK and the clothes that are UNK into the body . UNK to the UNK .
This is an incredibly painful event .
How can we treat these things that are hidden at the end of the day ?
Some of you don 't even think of it because they were born because they were born on the day .
Nobody has 't be much more at that .
And if these people are going to be free for their freedom , they burn their house .
And they were terrified , and they wanted to give up , but in the middle , this woman , in the middle of the world , would all be able to fight the same thing , and they keep the same , but on the other hand they had the freedom to help them get the freedom they had free them .
UNK UNK is the most often we 've heard about UNK , because in the world , I used to say , " If I 'm going to make this business , I 'm going to make a difference . "
By the way , I got UNK women .
And they brought me to the next layer of the staircase to a UNK , a UNK .
So this is not a big deal .
It 's more like a restaurant .
So the UNK restaurant is known to be UNK in the world .
UNK , UNK and children were only seven years of women who had no choice for their money to do more food and beer .
Each one of them is dark , and this is a map of three UNK and UNK .
People in this room are usually UNK by the people who are afraid of the people .
And I remember , in this case , in the dark , in the dark , deep fear of fear that I was going to be stuck in this room .
Here 's another one -- this is the staircase that I got on .
There was no UNK .
There was no windows .
These people are not allowed to escape what we know about UNK , including UNK , of course , in our backyard .
Hundreds of thousands of people are UNK . They 're more likely to do that .
Recently , in New York Times , two million children were sold to be sold by 60 million children .
These things are going on . We just don 't know it .
And the industry is often the case that we hear about UNK .
In India , I met a village called UNK .
This is a guy . "
So , in the end of the black hand , the father of his father and the red side of the two sons are the two sons .
And they were able to burn the fuel in the UNK , until it came down to the UNK , until the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK .
UNK to tell me about their stories .
" We had no UNK . They said .
So , we 'd like to get out of this room for the rest of the world in this room . "
In fact , there were more than 4,000 children in the world who were killed in the world with the world .
Well , I 'm going to see this .
I 'm going to be like a guy who killed two brothers and a few dots , like , right ?
UNK ! They were .
Children are being sold to work with their job at the boat , and they weren 't going to swim .
This little boy was eight years old .
By the way we walked around the boat , he was scared that he wasn 't going to kill him for him .
He was afraid of UNK .
You can see the trees with the trees , and they 're very often going to get rid of these bad bears , bad kids , to stop the water .
Many of you die .
By the time he started , he was UNK .
He was very scared , because he had so much more effective for him , and he had more than one of them .
When I was in the morning in the morning , we saw these guys in the end , and they started working on five o 'clock in the morning .
In this cold , cold evening .
You had to get a thousand pounds of weight in the water .
I 'm going to talk to you about UNK .
He was raised by a tree .
You see , he was in a family called UNK UNK to UNK UNK .
So , this is the photo that he was working on , and this is the best news that we were able to do in the middle of this country that they were able to be able to build their lives and make sure that children would be safe .
UNK : This is the possibility .
Because , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , the act of the world , the effect of his life will be going to change the world .
You drive in Ghana , in Ghana , with UNK and UNK , and all of the other things that are going to be moving around is the same kind of thing that is moving on our cars , and we 're going to be able to drive a little bit of this .
He gave us a UNK to the canopy .
In the end of the road , he UNK the driver .
And he said , " Well , this is not very clear . " " And this is the road . Come on ! "
We walked around with a UNK UNK , and we took an hour from the last 50 years , and I got to take the first time to get the UNK of the water down , and this was the water of the water .
And we walked two hours of UNK to the UNK , and every single one of the big UNK that we had , in every case , in the world .
Many women in their children , they are UNK around the hot water to the hot water .
UNK is used by the gold of gold .
These were people who were in the same place in Ghana .
And when they walked out of their lives , they walked out of their lives .
I remember that there were so many people in the upper face of the red world , and there were so many people in the world who were down there for about 12 hours a day .
So there are two meters deep , and they 're filled with the metal of UNK , and they 're UNK by the other part of the bubble to the gold .
UNK , UNK million men in the face , but we see some of the people in the edge , and there are other children .
These are the victims of all the victims .
In fact , there are two million people who are going to be used for this person , in this case , in this case , in this case , in the same way .
This is UNK . When his father died , his uncle took him to his job .
He killed his uncle at his uncle , and he forced his uncle to continue to work .
By the time , he was working on the metal photo , and he saw the leg of the leg of a UNK , and the doctors said they were going to die .
By the way , he had breast cancer , and he had to work every day for the same time .
And even though he also dream that can be the power to be able to work with his organization to be able to support education , this is the way that you can 't believe that it 's going to be so difficult to believe that it 's so difficult that I 'm going to be proud of education .
I want us to give them a lot of people .
And when I was working on this , I got a lot of UNK to my UNK , and I 'd like to make a difference for the fact that I wanted them to be able to light their stories and their mistakes , when they were safe , I took this series of photos .
And they knew that they were outside .
I 'm going to make them know that we will make their lives for them .
And I really believe that when we think of them as individuals , they don 't really be very hard to hate it .
These images are not just about the issue , the way people are , in the way , in the world , in the same way , in life , in the same way .
I didn 't think so much , I didn 't want to talk about this beautiful , but I wasn 't really afraid of people who were trying to meet people .
I 'd like to give you an idea of how this object will be possible to give you a sense of how the power of this is going to be the hope that this is going to be the hope to live in the world if you 're not going to live this way .
Thank you .
By the way , I 'm studying that there are special problems in all kinds of ways that are very different for us and management .
Nobody knew what we were .
So I 'm going to give you a few examples of what we are doing .
Well , dancing is a world of all of us .
So , we 'll be able to figure out that we 're going to get a good time , and we feel that we 'll be able to know that that 's going to happen .
So this is an amazing thing , and this is the most powerful thing that you can 't expect to be , and this is the result of what it means to be the gift .
But unfortunately , unfortunately , the nervous system , for example , had been so good to destroy this , and this is what happened to my friend UNK UNK , who was the UNK of his time .
This year , he had a lot of treatment , and there was a lot of progress .
But there are people who have no disease , and they 're not going to be treated so much , like UNK , UNK , so we needed an objective tool to test that .
And we need to measure the key to measure this , and we need to be able to figure out what the best of the world is , and if we got the key to the question of the question of the question of the question of the question .
But the sad thing about it was , there was no natural control , so you couldn 't do something you can do , and this is the best of the world that we could be able to do , and this is the case of 20 minutes .
You 've got to be able to get a clinic and spend a lot of it , which means that in clinical trials , never before .
But what if the patient can do this test at home ?
This can save the world where if the patient can make it for the trial ?
You don 't need a lot of money to hire people .
By the way , if you go to the UNK clinic , this costs 300 dollars .
So , I 'd like to introduce you to a new approach to try to make a goal because you knew , in some sense , in some sense , in some ways , in some ways .
Here I 'm here to show you a video clip .
This is a healthy state , and someone wants to think of it as the sound of the voice , because when we think about it , we had to deal with these UNK , which are very , very , very , like UNK .
And this is , in fact , in this case , in particular training .
You can think about it . You 're going to spend more time .
In the sound , we can UNK UNK by UNK , which can affect us by how we can 't be able to control it .
You can see this in the bottom there is a rule of rules of rules .
We see the same symptoms .
UNK , UNK , UNK .
You get more and more and more and more , and more like that , and more UNK , those are the examples of the symptoms .
In fact , most of the things that are very , very difficult to be very , very , very , very , very advanced , very innovative , very advanced machines , to be able to be very , very , very , very , very , very innovative machines , and now that we could be able to compare them to be very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very innovative machines , and now that we would be able to compare them to be very advanced in the world , and this is the only way that we would be good for the rest of the world and the disease of the world .
So , these are the kinds of tests that they use to be able to engage in the clinical clinical trial .
UNK tests are UNK , and they use the infrastructure .
You don 't have to design a whole new hospital to do it .
And they were all UNK , and they said , " Well , by the way , they don 't have to be anything else . "
This means they can do it by the patient .
And the speed is moving faster , and much more than 30 seconds .
And the price is very low , and we knew what was going on .
You can expand it by the price .
So here 's the great goal .
We can increase the benefits of the patient .
UNK to the clinic search test .
We can see how we can make the UNK information .
We can use clinical trials in clinical trials , very low , and we can be able to do that with the number of things that are going to be possible for the first time .
And we had a chance to figure out that this disease was done in the early ' 70s .
So , by the beginning , this is the beginning of UNK , the program .
And UNK and UNK and UNK , we 're hoping to record the sound of the number of things around the world to get enough data to see this four goals .
So the number of UNK on Earth is the call for UNK .
Any health care , any of the people who care about it will be , very cheap , for a few , a few hours a few times , and I 'm happy to announce that we are only eight hours of our goals .
Thank you .
UNK , by the way , to say , " You can see who is healthy , who is the disease ? "
What do you think about that ?
Right , so , so , so this is the way we tell us if you had a disease . UNK : Yeah .
You can 't say , well , some of you wouldn 't be able to call us or not .
But we also get a lot of data from different environments , and this is a different environment , because we can 't get rid of all the other things that they can get to -- that we can see this as the kind of UNK of the disease .
So , are you going to have an epidemic right now ?
It 's much more than that .
And in fact , I had to ask him , because he made some amazing results that he was able to build this program , and so now we 're approaching the rise of 99 percent of it .
UNK , well , that 's a big deal .
So , that means that people can -- you know , people can get the phone on your phone and do this for the phone , and then their doctors can see their progress , and they can tell them that they are in this disease that they are in this disease , to try to figure out what they are in this disease .
That 's how it works .
Thank you very much , UNK and everyone .
Thank you .
And since I had a big camera , I 've been passionate about photography , but I 'd like to share with you two pictures of three and many of my favorites .
There was no art , no UNK , no chance to keep light at the same time .
In fact , most of them are random , they were UNK .
My story UNK , I got invited to my wife and my wife , my wife and my daughter , and my daughter , who was her day , we were standing in UNK and UNK .
By the year after year , we went back to New York City , so we decided to make a similar picture .
You can guess what it is .
By the end of her daughter , my wife said , " Why don 't you take UNK New York to New York ? "
And this is how we were able to take pictures from the last year .
You know , take the camera a very common , very unusual thing .
Nobody won 't . You never got the camera . You never got the camera .
At that time , we didn 't really understand how this journey was going to change our lives .
By the way , it 's getting sacred .
This is a few weeks after 9 / 11 , and I tried to explain what happened after 9 / 11 .
So these pictures are so much more than just recorded a moment , or a special journey .
These are the way that we can remember in the last 20 years , let us think about how we think about how we think about how we think about how we can see how we 're going to see how we 're going to be different than the different changes in the world .
