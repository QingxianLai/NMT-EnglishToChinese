And I was 11 when I was 11 , and I had heard of my morning listening .
My father was listening to the UNK on the gray radio radio radio .
He brought up his eyes , because most of the news 's going to be frustrated .
" The Taliban walked ! " The fathers call it .
And I don 't know what that means , but I can see the fathers are very happy .
" You can get a real school . " He said .
I never forget that morning .
A real school .
When I was six , the Taliban had to come to school in Afghanistan in Afghanistan .
So after that five years , my UNK and I went to school and my sister came to a secret school that never allowed to be outside .
This is the only time that we 've been educated .
We 're going to walk differently in different ways that don 't know where we 're going to go .
And we put them in the food UNK , and they thought we would be in charge .
The school is in a house where we have more than one in a small living room .
It 's very comfortable in winter , but it 's very hot .
We all know that our lives in life -- teachers , students , students and parents .
And sometimes , there was a week in which every week , because of the Taliban .
We 're always worried about the Taliban .
Do we get track ?
Do they know where we live ?
We 're afraid , but we still want to go to school .
And I was fortunate to grow the family of my girls .
My grandfather was a remarkable man in his mind .
And he was born in Afghanistan , and he had different ideas about his daughters , and my mother , to go to school , and he was to go to school and was to be able to fight to school .
But that was my mother 's mother became a teacher .
That 's her .
She was retired after two years ago , and it turned out to be my school and women and women and women .
And my father -- it was the first person in his family .
And so sure , his child should be educated , including his daughter , even though the Taliban had the risk of risk .
And for him , kids don 't accept education for education .
When the Taliban control in Afghanistan , I remember that sometimes I would be afraid of my life , looking for the future .
And I wanted to give up , but my dad would say , " Listen , my daughter , you may have to lose anything in your life .
You may be killed , you may be the war .
And what you can do with that is that , if we have to sell blood to pay your money , we 'll be blind .
But even if you don 't need to continue ? "
Now I 'm 22 .
My country was killed by the last year , and it was destroyed by the last year .
The women in the age of my age , high school in high school in high school in high school there was not my family , I would be like most of you .
And today I 've been a proud of a proud UNK .
One of the things from the top of the United States , in the United States of America , in the United States , in the United States , in the United States , on the United States , as I went back to Afghanistan , my grandfather , my grandfather , came out of school , and that was the most amazing thing I had ever had in my house when I came to school , my grandfather , my daughter , my daughter , my daughter , my father , the UNK , is the most interesting thing I 've ever come up with .
He was just not just because my university was , because I was the first person in women in the women , and I was the first ever to take my car and I was in the women in the middle of that year .
And my family had to believe me .
And my dream was big , but they had to be more expensive .
And that 's the reason I 've been the UNK of the UNK , and this is the global organization for women .
And that 's the reason I 've been working on this , which is the first thing to be in Afghanistan , because in Afghanistan , let 's go to school as well as Afghanistan , and to give girls to be a very dangerous .
And what excites me was that , I saw my students in my school could be able to be able to get the opportunity to be UNK .
And I saw their parents , especially their fathers , like my father , even though they had the fear of the face .
For instance , this is not the real thing , but it 's not true , and I can 't see him in front of him , and he 's the father of my student .
And not one month ago , his daughter was killed by the streets of school back in school when they came from school .
And he came out of the phone , and one of the voices was , he was going to give his daughters to come back and come back to school , and what happened then that would happen again .
" If you think , now , you can kill me , " he said , " but I won 't forget my daughter 's future and destroy my daughter 's future 's future . "
And for Afghanistan , what was the West -- this was the West -- was the father of the West -- is that the father of our success -- he can recognize the value of his own daughter , the success of her daughter , is the success of what it is .
And it 's not just that mothers are not important for us .
In fact , for the good future of our girls , they usually are the first UNK of UNK and UNK , but in Afghanistan like Afghanistan , we have to have a man 's support .
And in the Taliban , they had a few hundred and a half -- don 't forget , it was illegal .
But today , the girls in Afghanistan have been more than three million people .
Afghanistan is a big difference between Afghanistan .
And I found out that Americans can see the fact that we change .
And I was worried that these changes in the United States will be able to maintain that long .
But when I go back to Afghanistan in Afghanistan and support their parents and encourage them to support their parents , I saw the hope of the future , and see that that changes going on .
And for me , there was a possibility of hope between Afghanistan and UNK , every single day in UNK .
Like me , they had a lot of dreams .
Thank you .
Everything that I did , both in my life , my entire life of life on the last seven years of work in Africa .
I was young , but I was very young , but I was 14 of my UNK , Kenya , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK ,
And I was working in a Italian NGO , and we failed every single project in Africa .
And I was going to grab it up .
At the age of 21 , I think we 're UNK , we 're working for a good job for living in Africa .
And yet , what do we do ?
And the first of the first projects that we wrote about my first book , which is called " The UNK of UNK , " in this project , we decided to teach UNK UNK .
So one of the seeds that we took in Italy , the seeds of UNK , a UNK , UNK UNK , where we teach local local UNK and UNK and so on and so on .
And of course , the people who were interested in that , so we had to ask them to work , and they spent a few minutes to be here .
There 's a lot of UNK in the UNK , and there 's a lot of UNK in the West , and we 're really surprised at this .
But we didn 't ask them to be , but by the way , " Thanks for us . "
" You know , when you 're hungry , you know , you get out of a UNK . "
And , of course , there 's a very good thing in Africa .
We 're beautiful . In Italy , one of the big UNK is the size of a UNK , in Zambia , in Zambia .
It 's really incredible . We talk to UNK : " Well , deforestation is easy . "
When it comes out of the spectrum , the UNK UNK , from UNK to UNK , from UNK to 60 percent of all of these UNK , all of these UNK .
Let 's say , " Oh , my God , this fear ! "
The UNK said , " Yes , that 's the reason we 're not here here . "
" Why not you ? " you didn 't ask . "
And one of the things I thought was that in fact that we were in Africa in Africa in Africa , but when I know that America , the United States , the United States , is the last one of the United States , France , when you see them , I was proud of a project that was very proud of the city in Mexico .
Because , at least for us , we 've got a UNK .
You 've got to see these garbage -- -- you know , you should see what we 've done in the West Africa .
You can read this book , and it 's called " The UNK , " it 's about UNK and a UNK economist .
This book was published in 2009 .
We spent two billion dollars in the last 50 years in the last 50 years .
And I 'm not going to talk about what you can do with your money .
You 're going to read it .
Look at how many of you have in Africa 's life in Africa ?
We 're in the middle of the country , the UNK , our UNK , our UNK , our UNK , the way we 're working on people -- two and more .
These two words come from Latin America to say , " UNK , " the father .
But two words are different .
The parents UNK meant that I was thinking about my kids in my kids , " I love your kids . "
And one of the things I wanted to do was to talk about that one of the other cultures in my context .
And that 's why it 's called in Africa that 's called " UNK , " it was the boss .
When I was in reading a book , the book called UNK , the book called " The UNK , " which was the most important thing , if you didn 't want to help people help .
It should be the first principle of aid .
The first principle of aid aid is to respect .
And one morning in this conference , Mr. UNK in the ground in the ground , said , " Can you be able to imagine where you can imagine a city without new ? "
And when I was 27 , one of the things that I 've done , that we 've been working on aid aid , and I 've come up with a job system called UNK , and we don 't have a lot of UNK , and we don 't have to be able to do things that we don 't work with people , but we don 't know what to do , and we don 't have to be able to do that , but we don 't have to be able to do that , but we don 't know what to do , and we don 't have to be able to do that , but we don 't have to be able to do that , but we don 't have to be able to do that , but we don 't know what it 's about to be working for the local and the local and services that people will find better lives in the local and services for people to find better lives in the local and services for people to find better lives .
So what we need to do -- it 's shut down .
And we walked into a community where they weren 't going to UNK each other , but they were sitting in the middle of the people .
We 're not in the office .
We met them in a restaurant and a bar .
We don 't have the infrastructure infrastructure .
And what we 've done is , they are friends , and they find their interest and UNK .
And the most important thing is passion .
You can ask for your ideas .
But if each other of you are interested , what do you do ?
It 's the most important thing that we 've come to be able to do this .
The passion for each other is to be based on the basis of one of the most important .
And then we can help them with knowledge and information , because that 's not the line of a line or a line or a line .
You know , you have the idea of ideas of ideas , but we can offer support .
And so many years ago , I had an idea that couldn 't be time with listening to their ideas , not just for us ?
Let me tell you a secret .
There 's a problem in the community .
entrepreneurs go out and they don 't want to tell you where they 're going on in public school , where they are , or what they 're doing .
So it 's a UNK .
You don 't even have the smartest of your community in the community , because they don 't .
We thought it was , and we had to be able to build a UNK infrastructure that we could build in .
We had to create a whole new career .
It 's a private family , and this company , and this company , and then you 're in your house in your house , or in your kitchen table or in your kitchen , or in your kitchen , and help your local resources to get your support of your business and give you the support of your business .
I spent a study in UNK in UNK .
And as I was reading , I was working on my UNK so I was going to go back to this sort of thing that I wanted to leave in my life that was going to be UNK at the end of this day .
And one of the first kids that I spent in the last year when I had the first client , and I had the first client in my garage , and I was able to sell him to sell a restaurant , and then I teach him to sell a restaurant , and then local fishermen come in and say , " You 're the UNK ? Are you going to pay us ? "
And then I 'll leave that five and a half of them , and they sell it to Japan , and one of these things are going to be a UNK in 60 cents a little bit more than 60 and a half a little bit more than a 60 and a half a little bit of money , and then I 'll say , " Hey , do you help us with them , but can you help us with money ? "
And one year after year , I had 27 projects , and government got to ask me , " What do you do ?
How can you help me ? " I made a very difficult thing .
That 's the mouth , listen to them . "
And so -- so the government said , " That 's what you do . "
We 've got about 300 communities in the world for about 300 communities in the world .
We 've had to build a UNK company .
New generations of entrepreneurs are doing nothing to do .
UNK , the greatest UNK of UNK in the history of UNK UNK , UNK UNK .
UNK was a philosophy to be a philosophical professor , and Dr. UNK was said that , " The project is to be related to a business of trade and social and business economy . "
And that 's the project for business .
Now , what we 've been able to do right now is to rebuild the UNK and the UNK of how many people think about how to use their own money or their own money .
We have to learn how to make these people .
We had to give them their privacy and respect their privacy , and we wanted to help them for them , and then they would be , they would be , they would , they would , they would be , they would , they would be , they would , they would be , they would , they would be , they would , they would be , they would , they would be , they would , they would be , they would , they would be , they would , they would be , they would , they would be , they would , they would be , they would , they would be , they would , they would be , they would , they would be , they would , they would be , they would , they would be , they would , they would be , they would , they would be , they would , they would be , they would , they would be , they would , they would be , they would , they would be , they would , they would be , they would , they would
We 've got 200 customers in a community community .
Can you imagine a community of UNK and how much of intelligence and passion ?
Who 's going to be here today ?
It 's a private passion . You 've done that for them .
So one of the things I wanted to talk about was that it 's the business of innovation .
When we 're in one of the industrial revolution in the first industry -- we use a UNK fuel in fossil fuels , but we suddenly realized that this is not sustainable .
There 's a day in the fuel that 's going on in a UNK fuel .
You can do it with UNK and UNK .
And what we need to focus on is how we 're going to focus with seven billion people in a very sustainable way , health care , education , education and communication .
The technology is not going to do this .
Who can be able to develop this technology for green ? Don 't you ?
Will the government ? Don 't you !
And it 's entrepreneurs that they 're working for .
Many years ago , I saw an interesting article in a UNK magazine .
UNK , there was a experts who was invited to talk about what 's going on in New York City .
And that 's the UNK , and that 's where people got together , and that 's where they came together , and that 's what they came up with in 100 years , and they said , " 100 years later , New York is going to be the last year .
Why ? Because they looked at the curves in the graph , when people continue to grow six or six million people in the New York City , they would have to be able to sell six or six barrels to be able to do that .
And you know , they 're going to die .
And so UNK , they thought , this UNK technology will save lives in New York .
So what happened ? 40 years later , 60 percent of the United States and United States had the UNK UNK UNK .
And there 's a new technology that we can develop , and there 's a lot of UNK , and there 's a lot of UNK there .
For example , for example , for example , for example , New York City .
And yet , there 's a secret to trade .
First of all , you 're going to give them your reward .
Otherwise they wouldn 't come for you to talk about .
And then you wanted to focus on what they wanted to focus .
You 're going to tell them about UNK .
And whether you 're a big company or a small company , you 'll get the three things that make you better ; the quality of the market is to UNK , the market is to be efficient .
And what 's the problem ?
There 's no one person running at the same time and sell and sales and financial work .
There 's no way .
There was no such thing as it was born .
And we 've been working on 100 companies in the world to study -- Carnegie companies , UNK companies , UNK companies , UNK companies , UNK companies , UNK companies , UNK companies , UNK companies , UNK companies , UNK companies , UNK companies .
All of the things that we 've been working on in the world is only one in common and only one of the companies that make a human being .
Now what we 're working on in New York City , when I was four pages old , we started to figure out what they were doing , and what they were doing , what they were doing , what was the word that was available on the UNK of the United States , that was the word that was available in the last two pages ?
And one of the things that we had , " We used to be 32 .
He was not alone .
Nobody can be alone alone alone . Nobody .
So we can build a community in this community , and we have come from a small private background in the UNK , and in the UNK , we can give you what you 're about to say to you , and we 'll ask you , " What do you need ?
What can you do ? Can you produce it ?
Can you sell it ? Do you sell money ? "
" Ah , I can 't go . Can I help you with this ? "
We encourage entrepreneurs to be entrepreneurs in groups .
We have volunteers , and we 've got volunteers , and we find out that local people who can be able to build out of local goods and human beings , and we find that there 's something that innovation can change the culture of the community and the economy that you can use to change the culture of the community and the economy in which you can use it to change the culture of the community and the economy , and so that you can use this passion to change the culture of the community and the economy in which you can use it to change the culture of the community and the economy , and so that you can use this passion to change the culture of the community and the economy in which you can use it to change the culture of the community and the economy , and so that you can use this passion to change the culture of the community and the economy in which you can use it to change the culture of the community and the economy in which you can use it to change the culture of the community and the
Thank you .
Five years ago I had a sort of UNK from my UNK .
In UNK University , one of the things I teach to talk about school is to teach students to talk about students .
And I was scared .
And I was really scared , I was really scared of these students , and then they read their words , and then they used the same word that they read , and then the word that came back to me .
But as we had a conversation with a conversation like that , I saw in my life like that , and then I saw that there was a whole door to the door in my life like that .
And that is the feeling that my students and those students had to be surprised when they were surprised in their ideas , and I wanted other people to be able to experience each of those in my ideas .
And I believe that the key to open up is to be good communication and communication .
In order to change the world , we should have to start with our scientists and engineers .
Our scientists and engineers have been dealing with health care , and so on energy and so forth , and if we don 't understand that , they don 't understand what we don 't understand , and we believe that we have a responsibility to engage with them .
But if our scientists and engineers aren 't going to look at our UNK and look at what they 're doing , we can never be good here .
So scientists and engineers , let 's talk about what technology is .
And I want to share with you a couple of these ideas , and tell you how you can make sure that we 're going to be able to ensure that we 're going to be able to ensure that you 're going to be able to be the science of this science , your engineering UNK , your engineering technology .
And the first one was to answer our questions : What 's the technology ?
Let us tell you , why not you are .
Don 't tell me when you study bones in my study , and to tell you , it 's because of this skeleton that 's because of this skeleton of this skeleton , a very important part of this skeleton .
And then when you describe the science of science , it 's time to be aware of the term .
And the idea is that we understand a barrier to your ideas .
And of course , you can say , " UNK , " it 's why we don 't talk about space with time .
And let 's say it 's easy to say , it 's easy to say it 's easy .
Instead , as the Einstein says , let 's be simple , not a simple .
You don 't need to change your mind to change your UNK theory .
You can think about some of these things , stories , and things like that , these are the UNK things that we talk about , let 's talk about things that we 're excited about .
And then on the slide , you can see what you 're looking at here at a slide .
Do you like that , right ?
The bullet was there ? You could kill them , and you could get rid of your show here .
And like this slide , it 's not boring enough , but it 's too limited to depend on our brains , but we can 't believe in our brains .
And this is the number of images from UNK , which is the number one of the things that we 're going to say , because it 's very powerful , UNK , UNK , UNK UNK in UNK , even the UNK of the UNK of the UNK UNK .
And the trick here is to use a simple , UNK sentence , so that the audience may be able to be able to be able to figure out , and then we 'll be able to figure out what we 're looking at , and then we 'll be able to figure out what we 're looking at .
And that 's what I think is going to help us with all of us in the next door of the door and the idea of science and engineering .
And so , because of the engineers that I 've been working on in my school , I wanted to show up that I was able to touch my mind , and I wanted to conclude with a equation that I wanted to talk about in my mind .
And the science of all of you who 've been studying your UNK , my UNK , is to share with the audience , to give you the passion of what you 're doing , and that 's what you 're doing right now , and that 's why you 've got a lot of understanding of what 's going on , and you 're going to be able to figure out what it 's all about .
And so scientists and engineers , when you 've solved the equation , you know , it 's going to be the technology for me to talk about innovation .
Thank you .
And one of the words I love to say English is called " UNK . "
Not only because it sounds good .
And it means " a politician . "
And even though this is a good definition of one of the newspaper newspaper in the last newspaper , he says , " The guy in this room , he doesn 't care about what he doesn 't care about , or any of you , or any of the subject , or any of the subject , or any of the subject , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK UNK , UNK , UNK UNK , UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK , UNK UNK ,
And I also don 't understand what it means .
Now , it 's like a word for words . I suppose .
But the word is really important for political centers , and all of these politicians understand that they have to try to control their words .
For instance , it wasn 't until UNK , and the British Parliament had allowed the news to be that they were writing about the real words that they were talking about .
And in fact it 's because of a man , the great name is called UNK UNK , and that 's the UNK .
He was killed by London in London , but he 's got enough of the courage to be able to inspire that , and then finally , he won 't be there for a lot of support voices in London in London .
And for a few years , we had the first record ever used in " The UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK . "
A lot of people think that 's called a piece of metal .
No , it 's come from a UNK UNK .
But to the real point of words and politics , I wanted to take you back to this century where it was just announced independence .
And when they had a problem , they had to figure out how to speak , their leaders , their leaders .
They don 't know .
What should be the leader of UNK ?
This is a long time in Congress .
And there 's a lot of advice about this advice .
And what I mean , some of you call George Washington , he 's called UNK UNK , and the other man called UNK UNK on the UNK , Washington .
There was no name of the name .
Some people wanted to call him a king .
And they thought it was a UNK that was used in the past .
And they don 't even have to go back , and their idea is that you can be a UNK in the king of the election .
You know , it 's going to be possible .
And each of us , every single one of these UNK , UNK , in fact , because that 's going to be three weeks in this debate .
And I read a UNK in the poor , and there was this issue going on , and that was the subject of this issue . "
And the reason for UNK and tired is that that 's what Abraham Clinton 's going on right now .
The White House doesn 't want to be in Washington with power .
And they didn 't want to call him what he wanted to be the king of the king .
So they gave him a UNK , UNK , UNK name .
And this is called " UNK . "
And they didn 't create this title . I mean , it 's a meeting , but it 's a UNK .
Like the UNK UNK .
And it 's not very , very , very UNK , UNK UNK .
And although there 's a small number of thousands of meetings that are going to have a UNK meeting , but it 's really not true .
And that 's why it 's against the title .
And they said that it 's absurd . You can 't call him a conference .
This guy has to do the UNK and the UNK .
And who was going to ask him , if he had just a stupid piece of a UNK , like the United States of America , say , would be the UNK UNK ?
And then three weeks later , it didn 't stop .
And as a UNK , they agreed to be the UNK of the UNK and the UNK , whether it 's the Republican , or in the UNK office , it 's UNK in the UNK office , which is the UNK of the UNK , the UNK , or the UNK , is that we don 't want to be considered by the UNK of a group of UNK in the United States , which is what we don 't want to be considered .
Now , from this story , you know about three interesting things .
First of all , my favorite place , where I can find the information I can find , which is that there 's no evidence of UNK in the book that I could find .
The president of President Obama , right now , it 's time to be UNK here in the early ' 90s .
The second thing you can know is that when the American government claim that it 's just a temporary way -- it 's going to be sustainable .
But the third thing that you can know , and it 's very important , is that I wanted to leave you with this -- that this is the title of the United States , and that 's the American UNK , UNK UNK ?
And it 's about 5,000 UNK of UNK in UNK , but there 's the largest economy in the world , and there 's a whole lot of UNK and other UNK of the world .
The reality of the reality and the history has led to this poem .
So the end is won .
They got their UNK .
And one of the things that happened in the early year was listening to this slide , and it was listening to me .
But now , how many countries have you ?
Two hundred .
And that 's because they wanted to be able to hear their own name like 5,000 UNK , etc . , etc .
And so on the end of that day , that was the end of the Cold War , because nobody was told when they were told that they were the president of the United States .
And it 's a very important lesson that I think that you can learn from this and I wanted to leave with you .
And the politicians have to say that , but in fact , that the reality of the idea is to shape and control the reality , but in fact , the reality is that the reality of the universe is far beyond the fact that the words can change reality .
Thank you very much .
And I was walking back in 50 of these UNK UNK in Iraq , and I was 19 and I was living in UNK and UNK .
And I used my black hole in my black and UNK , and I had nothing to do with a hole in a UNK with a very UNK system .
This is my first time in Afghanistan .
When I grew up in the war in a war in a war on my UNK , my kids ' UNK , my kids ' UNK and the women in the middle of the world , and then at the end of the people in the middle of this room , and then , Afghanistan , Afghanistan ! " And then , at the end of that day , what was going on in Afghanistan ?
But that 's what we do .
And so I stand here today on the ground in Afghanistan , and God 's UNK , my UNK , my UNK , my UNK , and my UNK , working on the last nine years , working in Afghanistan , working in the last nine years , working in Afghanistan .
And in Afghanistan , you can create a lot of good things in the art of art , but I don 't want to describe what I wanted to be able to be able to be able to be able to figure out how to be able to figure out how to be able to figure out how to be able to figure out how to define identity of identity , which is to be able to figure out what to do with whatever identity of identity of identity , which is to say that I 'm going to be able to be able to figure out how to be able to figure out what it 's like to be able to figure out what to do with this world , that is to be able to figure out what to do with this world that 's going to be able to figure out what to do with this world .
And I wanted to be with a journalist that I wore in front of a day standing in a UNK of UNK and political UNK , and political corruption , and political corruption , and political corruption , are becoming rich .
And that was the official molecule that had been to go back to the public and say , " I 'm going to ask me , " I 'm a journalist , " I 'm a UNK , " What can be I do ?
And I had tried to get out of elections that would be the man 's hero 's hero .
And one of the things that I wanted to see in Afghanistan was that there was a UNK in the streets of Afghanistan in the streets of Afghanistan and UNK in the streets of the UNK of the streets , not to be asked , or to be able to stop , or to be able to ask their name , or to be able to help their name in order to get the money back in the UNK of the UNK ?
And what I wanted to know was that in the context of this conflict in Afghanistan is about the art of conflict .
The war and the UNK of the war and the UNK of this field of UNK and UNK in the UNK and UNK UNK in the UNK UNK in the UNK and UNK UNK in UNK in this room .
And what I wanted to do is to put a simple and UNK into the wall and talk about contemporary art , as you know from the UNK of the UNK , is called " white UNK of UNK UNK , " which is the UNK of green skin to save UNK skin , even more of their civilization .
But what you can do . You may be able to get back in jail .
But one of the things I had to do was to ask myself to do what I wanted to do .
That 's my patient . What about you ?
Thank you .
Hi , I 'm a UNK , and one of my time I was a model .
Actually , 10 years .
Now , in this room , I felt a very uncomfortable in this room , because I didn 't wear that hat .
And thanks to me , I took a different approach .
This is the first UNK on the TED stage , so I think it 's very lucky to be lucky .
And if there were those women who I was going to talk about , I was not told to tell you , but it 's going to be familiar with the robot .
And I also wanted to tell you , I was lucky enough to change my image in 10 seconds .
It 's nothing that anybody can do .
And that 's not comfortable with very comfortable and good news is I 'm not going to wear them .
And the worst news is that I 'm going to put this back in my head , because that 's what you 're going to do , and when I say , I 'm going to leave you with what I was doing .
You can .
So why did I do this ?
It 's odd .
It doesn 't seem like a picture like a picture .
It 's powerful , but at the same time it 's UNK .
I just changed myself in six seconds in six seconds .
And I was in this picture , in fact , in real life , in real life .
And when the photographer was in my hand , I was not comfortable with the hair of my hair .
And sure , from surgery or two days before my job to work , we basically can 't change the way that we can change the way we change them , even though we don 't change the way we change them , even though we don 't change the way we change them , although we live in a position , we 're not in a big position , but it 's a big impact on our lives .
And so today , for me , it 's got to be honest with this .
Today I 'm here today because I 'm a model .
And I was in this stage because I was a beautiful UNK , and we called it the UNK girl .
And I 'm going to answer to people that often ask my questions to be honest with some of you .
The first question is , how do you become a model ?
And I always say , " I 'm the UNK , but it doesn 't mean anything .
The real reason for me is that I was the most powerful gene , and I was the UNK of my legacy , and you may be the UNK of the story .
Well , in the last few centuries of that we define in the last few centuries , not only to be healthy , young and UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , white skin , white skin .
This is my legacy , this is my legacy .
And I know that some of you may be able to say to this point is that you may be able to read some of these things , like " UNK , " or " UNK , " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " "
First of all , I 'm going to encourage you to figure out what you 're doing with a model of UNK .
But unfortunately , I had to tell you about all of this in New York City at the University of New York at the University of UNK UNK in UNK UNK in UNK , there was no UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK
And then the next question was my question was , " Can I grow a model ? "
And my first answer was , " I don 't know , because they didn 't let me take this stuff . "
But the second answer , I think , is this : " Why are we ? "
You know ? You can select anything .
You can be the president of the United States , or the next generation of the Internet , or a UNK , UNK , -- that 's the first thing you 're going to be .
And if , listen to those of these things , they said , " No , no , no , UNK , I think , " When my boss , I said , " When my boss , I said , " When my boss , I said , " When my boss , I said , " When my boss , I said , " When my boss , I said , " When my boss , I said , " When my boss , I said , " When my boss , I said , " When my boss , I said , " When my boss , I said , " When my boss , I said , " When my boss , I said , " When my boss , I said , " When my boss , I said , " When my boss , I said , " When my boss , I said , " When my boss , I said , " When my boss , I said , " When my boss , I said , " When my boss , I said , " When my boss , I said
Because I couldn 't decide anything you could be the UNK of the United States magazine or UNK on the United States , or the next UNK .
And so you grow up when you grow a model like that , as you say , you 're going to win a crash .
It 's not in your control ; it 's beautiful , but it 's not a commercial business .
And I 'm going to show you a couple of my research from about 10 years of studying this field , because it 's not like a UNK UNK , and it can only stand when it 's going to be .
So if the camera was here in the light here -- like the beautiful UNK , I wanted to get a UNK in front of my house , and then I wanted to get my hands in my house , my hands , and then I wanted to get my friends in front of a walk in front of a walk in front of my UNK , and then , and then , look at the friends in front of you in this room , which is 300 , 400 and a half , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK ,
It looks like this .
Don 't look like the middle of the middle .
I don 't know how it works .
And the reality is that when you graduate , when you graduate a couple of work , you can 't come back with that , and if you say you wanted to be the president of the United States , or you write about 10 years of work , you 've got to see you in the first time of the study that you 're going to see you .
The next question was , " Are they going to build these pictures ? "
And yes , they 'll be almost all pictures , but it 's just a small part of the job .
This is one of my first UNK , and my first one of my first UNK , my first UNK , my first UNK .
I know that 's private , but when I was young , I was young .
This is the picture I took from my grandmother a few months ago .
This is a picture of a photograph .
And my friend and I came together .
This is the picture of my French magazine last year before my UNK .
This is the picture of my UNK magazine .
This is me now .
And I want you to figure out that these aren 't my own pictures .
And it was made up of a group of researchers , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK
The next question is , " What do you get free ? "
And I do have a lot of UNK , UNK , but for free stuff , it 's something that we don 't want to talk about in real life .
And when I grew up in UNK , I was growing up and I was walking in a shop , and they sent me to a shop and they sent me one of these guys .
And at the age of my friend , I drive with my friends , I think it was a bad driver , and we had zero light in the UNK , and we had just stopped one of the UNK , and I just said , " Well , we 'll continue on the road . "
And what I found is that , instead of what I did , instead of identity as identity , some people pay for money for their appearance .
I lived in New York City last year , UNK UNK in UNK , and they were young men , young men , young kids .
And in New York and UNK , there are UNK and UNK , UNK , right ?
Are I going to stop ? I 'll be stopped ? "
When I was working on this talk about this talk about the United States girls in the United States in the United States in the United States in the United States who had not had their bodies to be 17 years old , this is going to go up and down 17 years .
So what 's the last question is , is , what 's the problem ? "
And I guess what they 're going to expect is to say , " Well , you know , you know , you get a little bit cold , and you have a UNK in your hair and you 're happy , you 're going to be happy , it 's going to be happy , " you 're going to be happy , it 's going to be happy , " you 're going to be happy , it 's going to be happy , " you 're going to be happy , it 's going to be happy , " you 're going to be happy , it 's going to be happy , " you 're going to be happy , it 's going to be happy , " you 're going to be happy , it 's going to be happy , " you 're going to be happy , it 's going to be happy , " you 're going to be happy , it 's going to be happy , " you 're going to be happy , it 's going to be happy , " you 're going to be happy , it
When we 're in the back , we 'll give a look like that .
And we said , " Yes we 're traveling and we have creativity , it 's amazing . It 's amazing . It 's amazing . It 's amazing . It 's amazing . "
And that 's true , but that 's the only half of the fact that we 'll never say , " I 'm not going to say , " I 'm not safe .
Because I had to worry every day I had to worry .
And what if you wanted to be more UNK in my leg , my hair was better , I was happier ?
You 're looking at the model of the model , because they have the most UNK , UNK hair , beautiful clothes that you may have in the world without any woman 's in the world .
And so when I was ready to do this talk , it would be honest to find a balance , because if I was standing here , and I said , " Look , let 's say that there 's something that 's natural to be , " in my life , if you can 't do it , you can 't be happy .
But one of the most difficult things to show gender and UNK , because my body is the biggest sign of it .
But at the same time I was very happy with respect , not only 10 or 30 or 30 or a UNK and computer industry , and I was not going to talk about how I was going to get my first job when I was to get my first job .
And if this talk is going to help you , from this talk , I hope that we will be able to identify the power of ideas of what we know and what we know .
Thank you .
Today I 'm going to talk today .
Don 't say I 'm normal .
And I want to talk to you about my two brothers .
This is 22 and 22 and a half of this year .
He doesn 't talk , but it can be able to communicate with his special ideas , the best talk .
The UNK know what a love is .
He was not here to share the love of that love .
He doesn 't care about what other people are .
He doesn 't have a UNK . He never said no word .
And when he sang our childhood singing all my childhood , he reminded me that he reminds me that we know nothing about what it is , but it 's amazing .
It was 16 and 16 and a half of this year .
He 's got a UNK memory .
But it 's got sex .
He doesn 't remember my chocolate in my chocolate , but remember that when my iPod was on my front of this song in my front year , he was looking at the first time when I was in my front of my talk when I was the first of my talk about my talk when I was walking on my front of my wife and then on my back and then on my back and then on my back .
Sounds amazing ?
But a lot of you think it 's true .
And the fact is , because they don 't fit the human being in a normal way , they are often isolated and UNK .
But the thing that made me was that , even though the reality of truth is that they are not just as normal as they are , they 're a significant thing , but it 's got autism , but it 's a lot of fun .
Some of you may not be able to know , " The term " is the UNK of a complex brain disorder , but it 's a UNK disorder that causes a UNK disorder , and sometimes it 's got a UNK disorder .
Every single case is special in every case of UNK and UNK .
In the world , every 20 minutes , one of the new UNK of UNK in the world is one of the fastest diseases of the planet , but we don 't know how it 's going on .
And one of the first things I know about this word " UNK " in this word I was here .
When I was three years old , my brother was born when my son was born , and my grandfather was born , and I had a new family .
And then after a few months , I realized he was a different picture .
He 's dancing .
He doesn 't want to be like other babies , it 's like I 'm not interested in .
The UNK UNK in his own UNK UNK in his UNK , he was looking for fun in a tiny world , he was looking for fun in the house , he was going to put all of these things in the house , he would leave the house and put them in a mobile phone and plug it into the washing machine .
And when he grew up , he had to be able to be more unique .
In addition to UNK and UNK and UNK UNK and UNK UNK UNK , he was the UNK nature of the world , the UNK UNK looking at the world , and he 's got to lie on the world .
It 's not easy .
And I can 't believe in my house , but I think they wanted to be very difficult when I was in my life .
But then I turned back and I thought about what it was about to be in my personality , my relationship , my love , and I thought that these things -- I was not willing to work with normal things .
" UNK " is the UNK of UNK and UNK differences .
It just means different species .
And I just wanted to say that you don 't need to be a normal word for you .
You can be extraordinary .
Whether it 's the difference between us , but each of us has a common sense that we have all of us , right ?
UNK and progress and change is that we don 't need to be the same as we think it 's true .
Don 't say I " normal . "
Thank you .
Dr. Dr. UNK , Dr. UNK , who used to be the UNK of this crash with the Apple and curiosity , of this picture , only six seconds .
But now , 50 years later , we can get a million times more of a second , or a UNK of a second , or a second and a half seconds .
And now I 'm going to show you a new picture of this : it 's called UNK , and it 's a technology that 's very easy to capture light .
So with this technology , we can be able to see light in the window of the light that 's going to see if we can see the lights in the corner of the light , or maybe light , we can see ourselves in the UNK of your body , and we 've got the idea of the camera that 's going on in your body 's definition of the camera that we 're looking at .
Now , if I use a laser pen , and a little bit of light in a second -- I 'll be able to build a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a crash .
Now , what if you put that gun into this bottle , these can be the UNK ?
What is the light bulb look like ?
Now , that 's the whole thing -- -- right ?
Now , remember , this whole thing in a crash -- it 's time to light -- but now I 'm going to slow down a million times what you see in the movement .
But Coke doesn 't fund this .
Now , there 's many things going on here , so let me show you something here .
Now , the light goes into a bottle , and that 's what we call a UNK , and it moves through a bottle , and it 's in touch with a light .
Some light came out of the table , so you start to see these waves .
And many of them ended up in the stream and they 're going to go through it .
As you can see , there 's a UNK bubble , which is in front of it .
And at the same time , the waves are then on the table , because in the top of the top , you can see in the UNK , you can see in the wings , you can see in a little bit of a bottle of light , you can see in a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a window .
Now , if you 're using the same thing with a UNK stop , very quickly , at the same time , you know what you need to be able to see how long you are ?
One day , one week ? In fact , one year .
And that would be boring . It 's going to be boring . It 's a normal crash .
But how about a thousand ?
And you can see that the UNK in the table is the UNK and the walls .
This is like a rock in the water .
And I think that that 's how nature come together , to fly a second , to fly a second , but of course what we see in the eye is the UNK .
But if you 're looking at this UNK , what you 're going to notice is that , when it 's close to the UNK , it 's UNK . It 's no UNK .
Why ? Because it 's UNK , and light turns back in the UNK of a thousand seconds .
So in the future , when you fly a UNK in your cell phone , you can go out in the supermarket , you don 't have to go back to the wall , you can 't figure out what to do with the fruit .
So how did I get this camera in MIT ?
Now , as a photographer , you know , if you want to be a text , you just have a little bit of light , but we need a million times faster than we can , but we don 't get any light .
So what we did was , we took these UNK , and we took a million and a half , and every time we had a good video , then we had a picture , and we saw it in a few cases , and then we saw one of these graphs , and one of them was what you saw before .
And we 've got all of the data going on in order to get there .
Now , smoke can go right now .
Some of the great heroes can be UNK , but imagine what a future is : he can see what he 's looking at .
And that 's how we can get some light into the door .
And these lights are going into the room , some of those will go back to the door , and then enter into the camera so that we can use these light reactions .
This is not a UNK . We really do .
On the left , you see our fly imaging imaging cameras .
And there 's a human model in the wall , and we 're going to do that with light .
And so , in our paper , it was written at natural Angeles , it was written about the Internet , and then they created this animation .
And we 're going to get rid of these lights , and some of these UNK will be going to UNK , and some of those can be going on , and one of the things that 's going to come back to us , and one of the things that 's going to come back to us , but the most interesting thing is that they will end back in the camera , but the most interesting thing is , you know , you know , you know , you 'll go back in the camera , but the most interesting thing is , you know , you know , you know , you 'll go back to the camera , but the most interesting thing is , you 'll go back in the camera and see if you 're going to go up and get a little bit of time going on a little bit of time .
And because we 've got the camera camera , we fly through a UNK camera , which is something special .
It 's got good time UNK , and you can capture the world in the speed .
So we don 't only know what the camera is , but we don 't know what 's going on .
And so we see this in the screen , as you can see , but then we take a lot of pictures , and we 'll take a lot of pictures , but we 'll take a lot of pictures , but then we 'll take a lot of pictures , and then we 'll take a lot of these things , and then we can see all of these things , right ?
Can we detect that ?
This is our lab .
And now we 're going to take a UNK in the future , and we can put this technology into the car , because they can see the UNK , or can we see the light in the window , or we can build the UNK , or we can build eye , or we can build the heart of the body , and we can go back to the heart .
But of course , because of tissue and blood , that 's going to be difficult , so what we 're going to call scientists to really focus on a UNK scanner in which to do this technology as a solution to the next generation of the next generation of the next generation of the next generation of the next generation .
Now , a scientist , a scientist , a scientist , and science became art , and one of the things that we collected in a time , not only science imaging , but also one of the new calculations of the time , we looked at the speed of time and colors and color , and we looked at the speed of time and UNK and UNK , and then we looked at the speed of light and color , and we looked at the speed of time and UNK , and we looked at the speed of time and UNK , and we looked at the speed of time and UNK , and we looked at the speed of time and UNK , and we looked at the speed of time and UNK , and we looked at the speed of time and UNK , and we looked at the speed of time and UNK , and we looked at the speed of time and UNK , and we looked at the speed of time and UNK , and we looked at the speed of time and UNK , and we looked at the speed of time and
But something interesting is happening here .
And when you see that , they 're moving away from us .
But it 's going to move us moving .
What happened ?
And the result is , because we 're looking at the speed of light in the speed of light , we have a strange phenomenon , and Einstein will be happy to see these images .
And it 's sometimes UNK in a camera , so it 's kind of cool when it comes back in time with time and space , and we can be able to break that down .
So instead of looking at the site , as the next generation of creating healthy images , that we 've been able to put all of these pieces and we hope that , and we 've got all of these tools and details to tell us that we should not be able to stand up with the UNK -- — — and start looking at the other side of the technology that we should not be able to tell you about today , but starting to focus on the other side of the technology that we should not be able to tell you about today .
That 's pretty much time . Thanks very much .
This is the place where I live in Kenya , in Kenya , in the National Park Park .
And that was my father in my UNK in the UNK Valley in Beijing .
There 's the south of the National Park , where there 's a whole lot of UNK behind that , which means that all of these wildlife can be free in a park in the park in a park .
So , like lions like lions are doing that , they are doing that .
And they killed our crops .
And that 's one of my dead cows in my evening when I wake up in the morning in my morning , because that 's the only thing I had in my house .
And we believe that we 're wearing our animals and our homes from heaven and then , that 's how we value them .
And so I became very upset with lions .
UNK were the women who protect their families and our livestock , but they were frustrated with this issue .
So they decided to kill these lions .
This is one of the six of these lions that are killed in UNK Park .
And I think that 's a lot of a lot of reasons than this is the UNK Park .
In our homes , when six and seven , they had the responsibility to protect their fathers , the same thing that happened in my life .
So I had to find a way to do that .
The first approach I thought was because I knew lions were scared of fire .
But then I realized that this didn 't work , and yet it helped lions see what we 've got .
But I didn 't .
And then there 's the second solution : UNK .
And I wanted to UNK them , and I was standing next to my house .
But lions are very clever .
And when they first came to see the first day , they came back , but then the next day they 'd come back and say , " That 's never going to be done here , but he 's running right here .
And so they jump in and they killed animals .
And one night , I was walking on my UNK , and then , lions don 't come .
And I started to realize that lions would fear moving .
So then I had a thought .
And because I was a kid , and I could spend a day in my house , and in my room , I was able to leave my mother 's UNK in my house , and then I had lost my mother and I had lost many of the knowledge that I had in my mother .
So I found an old UNK , a UNK , and this is a UNK device for UNK in a spectrum , to allow the light to light the lights down .
And at the same time I found a switch to control the light .
The light bulb comes from a bad UNK .
Everything is ready .
And as you can see , it 's UNK in solar panels to get the battery up into a battery , and that 's what you call the " I call it the " UNK . "
And this is what it 's going to be like in a UNK light .
As you can see , the light is UNK , because lions are from there .
And what you 're looking at here is what it looks like when the lion gets closer .
And the light UNK would be UNK when they were walking around me , but in fact , when I was on my bed , I had to do the best of my bed in my bed .
Thank you .
And I took this device in two years and then on my house , and we didn 't have a lion .
And my neighbors would have heard about this .
One of them is this grandmother .
There 's a whole bunch of birds that are killed by lions , and she asked me if I could help her in a house in a house .
I love to agree .
And I took these lights , you can see that , these are the UNK lights .
And now , I 've been working on my family 's UNK family in our family , and they 're very useful .
Now my approach has been in Kenya now , all of these kinds of UNK animals , like the UNK , the UNK , the same as they can be called the UNK of the UNK of the human .
And I was very lucky at this , because it was the best school in Kenya -- that was the best thing to do in Kenya , and I was surprised by this .
And my new school now joined in and help me how to improve and raise more money .
And I 'm going to take my friends to my community , and I can help them with this in my community , and I teach them how to build it .
And one year ago , one of the largest UNK of my dad in my UNK UNK in my UNK UNK , and told myself that always had a day , I was still there .
Today , I 've done it .
And I got the opportunity to TED . This was my first time .
So my greatest dream is that when I grew up , I was to be an airplane engineer and a pilot .
And I hate lions , but now , because my invention saved my dad and lions and lions , we finally got lions .
Thank you very much . I mean , it was , thank you very much .
You don 't believe , listen to your story .
So you 've got this scholarship . Richard UNK : Yes .
You don 't do it with something else ?
What 's next ?
So one of my inventions was , I wanted to be a UNK UNK : what about electricity ?
UNK : I know it 's got it , but I just wanted to do that one .
You 've tried that , you know , but you 've got a try , you know , I 've tried it , because it 's got me .
It 's a UNK . Richard UNK , you are different .
We 're going on every step of every step in growing life .
Thank you very much . Thanks .
I was living in Los Angeles .
This is the Los Angeles : The UNK UNK , UNK , UNK land .
And so the city 's office , they sat together and wanted to figure out what was going on in Los Angeles , and so they turned it into a South Los Angeles , which was going to solve this city 's real problem .
This is the UNK Los Angeles .
UNK hotel , food , UNK land .
In the United States , I lived in the UNK of food , and Los Angeles , L.A. , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK and UNK .
Interestingly enough to kill people killed less .
In Los Angeles , they died in Los Angeles .
For instance , what I lived with in my life in the neighborhood was less than five or eight times less than the UNK of the UNK UNK at UNK than the UNK of the UNK UNK .
And I was tired of these things .
And at the same time I think , if you don 't have a healthy food , what you 're looking at in your house , what you see in your community , what you 're looking at in your community today ?
And I saw a wheelchair , like a UNK car .
And I saw a UNK center like a UNK .
And I think I can 't do that again .
And I think that the answer is in the world .
And food is the problem , food is the solution .
And then I was tired of UNK for 45 minutes and back to a UNK with a UNK .
And so what I did , I was in my house , I was in my house .
It 's in the UNK of the park .
And 150 feet a little bit about 10 feet tall .
And that 's what happened to the government of government .
But it always needs to be able to maintain it .
And so I thought , " Yes ! This is my responsibility , I 've got to maintain it , so what I wanted to do , and what I wanted to do ? "
And that 's why I 'm going to maintain it .
And so my team and my team , " The UNK , we 're working together in order to grow our food forests , the UNK and the UNK .
We 're a free organization , and we 've been working with a UNK urban UNK , where we all have volunteers , and we all do all of the things that we do .
It 's beautiful .
But it 's going to be complaining .
The government told me that I had to get back to my garden and I had to get back to my garden , and then they became a warning .
I was like , " What 's going on ?
UNK in a small land on a small land than a small land ?
And then I thought , " Okay . "
Because it didn 't happen .
So the L.A. Times was written about this story of the story of the story of the group and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK , and then they 'll be able to get back on top of them , and then they get a UNK , and then they get a UNK sign , and we do it , and we 've succeeded .
We 've been able to get successful in our hands .
And as a teenager , they even came back to visit and say what he had to love and love what we were doing .
I mean , of course , how can they do that ?
There 's a UNK in the United States in Los Angeles .
It has the UNK UNK .
That 's 20 Central Park .
There 's enough space to grow the UNK of UNK .
And why did they think that ?
A tree can get a thousand and a half of the seeds .
One dollar of a dollar is to get 75 percent of your UNK .
This is my mantra , and I tell people , grow your food .
You know , it 's just like , you know , you get out of your food .
And then , in L.A. I had a legacy .
I grew up here , and I was working on my son there .
I 'm not going to be part of what I 've been building for , one of the things that I 've created .
You see , I 'm an artist .
The UNK job is my blog , and I 've created my art .
And it 's like the artist artist , they 've got the wall walls , and I , for UNK , UNK .
And I took the garden and the land as a canvas , and plants and trees were my name on my canvas .
You may be able to be able to do that , if you think of what you 're talking about .
You can 't imagine how amazing it is that there is something that 's going on in your UNK , and it will be the impact of what it 's going to be .
And what will happen ?
And I was looking at my garden and became a tool for my community .
In order to change communities , you have to change the properties of soil .
We are the soil .
You know how it 's affected .
The UNK activity is the most good thing to live healthy and challenging experience , especially this activity is in the UNK .
And then you get UNK .
And I remember once , one of my mom and my daughter in about 10 days in the morning , when I saw them , they were kind of UNK .
And they were really bad for me , and I told them , you don 't have to take food .
This is what happens in the streets of the street .
And when I saw in my life , I was hungry , and that led to what I wanted to do , and people ask me , " Don 't you know what you 're going to eat out of food ? "
And I said , " Of course , I 'm not sure it 's going to be UNK .
And that 's why it 's happening in the streets .
And that 's what I wanted .
I wanted people to take it , but at the same time , I wanted people to be able to save health bodies . "
And one of the things that happened when I was in a hospital in San Francisco Center for a garden .
And these guys have helped me get rid of that .
And that 's cool , they shared the story of how they 've created their own and their mother and their own mothers , and see that the garden can change their identity , which is a very cool thing to change their house , just to do that , just for that moment .
The green tissue turns out there was 20 garden .
We 've got about 50 people in the team , and they 're all volunteers .
If kids are growing up , children will be UNK .
And if they grow , they 'll eat .
But when these are all of the kids in our kids , if they don 't realize how food they are , how you know , they don 't have to be able to eat whatever they want to live in front of their lives .
And I saw young people who wanted to work , but they were willing to spend time on this thing , and I saw different UNK kids , and they used to be connected to what they wanted to be doing , and that is the way they do it .
And when it came together , I found a chance that we could train these kids to take their communities to take their communities and take a living in their community .
When we do that , we know if we 're going to do it .
And here was George George Washington .
But if we don 't change the soil , we never do that .
This led me to the project . This is what I wanted to do .
And I wanted to have a UNK that would be able to share food in this neighborhood .
I wanted to be able to get rid of water into the health of my health .
Don 't get me wrong .
I didn 't want to be free , because free would be sustainable .
And the funny thing about sustainability is that you have to maintain it .
And what I 'm talking about is , let 's get people working out of the streets , and let 's get kids from the streets and let them understand what you grow for food , which is to be and to be , to be , to be , to be , to be , to be , to be , to be , to be , to be , to be , to be , to be , to be , to be , to be , to be , to be , to be , to be , to be , to be , to be , to be , to be , to be , to be , to be , to be , to be , to be , to be , to be , to be , to be , to be , to be , to be , to be , to be like , to be , to be , to be , to be , to be , to be , to be , to be , to be , to be , to be , to be , to be
And so what I wanted to do was to figure out how to make that plan .
And I wanted to be able to be the UNK of the environmental revolution , the UNK , the UNK UNK .
We 're going to stop the definition of UNK .
And if you 're not alone , you 're not a UNK .
What happens when you take a pair of love ?
Make it be to be the weapon that you choose to be .
And basically , if you wanted to see me , if you wanted to meet , if you wanted to sit in your UNK chair , some of you would call them .
And if I want to see me , I 'll take a look at the garden in this room , so we can do something here .
And that was done . Thank you .
Thank you .
In 2011 , I was an X-ray of photography and a New York City in New York .
We are UNK , UNK .
We 're always in the middle of the black and UNK room in the middle of the room , and the studio is in order to stop the sun .
We 're going to UNK our UNK , to be able to UNK our UNK in perfect shape , and we 've been UNK , but we 've been working on the media , but we 're actually UNK artists , and the experience , our experience , our experience , our experience , our experience , our experience , our experiences , our experiences and images .
And in 2011 , when you see the world in the world today , I saw the tragedy of Japan in the house in the house .
And soon after that , I was working on a group called UNK , which is the team of UNK UNK on a few days , just in the local UNK campaign .
And I had a lot of UNK volunteers that I couldn 't leave , so I decided to join them in three weeks .
Back in May I came to UNK , and I came to Japan in Japan .
And that was a small village in Japan , where there 's only about 50,000 people in the first place where there was a UNK .
And the tsunami at the end of the tsunami was spent 24 meters , from two miles to the UNK .
You can imagine , this town must be UNK .
We are UNK in the UNK and the UNK .
We can help school and those UNK houses in order to rebuild and UNK .
We cleaned up a lot of UNK , UNK bones , those fish that fish can be built in local factories .
We become UNK , but we 're very UNK .
And in the last few weeks , all volunteers and local communities , they found something like this .
And they had found pictures of pictures , UNK , cameras and UNK .
And each of those is the response and action .
And then they collected these pictures and they send them back to each other .
Now , I realized that I had lost all of these pictures , and I had lost a major part of these people .
And when they 're suffering from the tsunami , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , that 's what you 're looking for .
And I was in the first week of Japan in Japan when I found myself in a UNK center .
It helps a large UNK UNK UNK UNK .
The local UNK center is collecting people lost .
And they sent back to the photo of this UNK , and I was fortunate enough to get my trust , to stop it , to get rid of these pictures .
And that 's how exciting that 's going to be , and I 've been listening to people say , " You have to be creative ! And then they burn those pictures , and I really did what I call " UNK . "
And when I was looking at those pictures , there was even a hundred years of UNK in a lab , and maybe I was able to convince them that they were able to control these pictures of UNK and UNK pictures , and also I know a lot of work that people could help them with these pictures .
So , in the end of the day , I went on Facebook and they asked me some of the UNK friends , and maybe the next morning , they were willing to help , and I know what we should do .
And then we started doing it .
This is the first attempt to try this .
It 's not too much to destroy , but the water in the water comes out of the little boy 's face , and we have to fix it , and it 's pretty accurate .
Otherwise , a girl 's face doesn 't look like her face -- that 's the tragedy , it 's the same picture .
And as soon as possible , as soon as possible , we wanted to help to deal with these pictures , and we also need to help to deal with these pictures , and then I went to a Facebook and my career online site , and about five days a week , there was 80 and a half of them were willing to help to help , they came from 12 different countries .
Two weeks , I got over 150 volunteers , and they were willing to join us .
And at the end of July , just in Japan , we built a bunch of these UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK and UNK .
Every week , we 're going up here in a temporary UNK , and people are going to come back to their photos and they come back to their photos .
Sometimes , some of the older women who never saw the UNK , they could take pictures of their lives , and then they could be able to put photos on the surface of the UNK so that they could be UNK , or strangers , they could come from the other side of the planet , and then they began to repair them .
And yet , at that time , they had to get back to these pictures , and , of course , it depends on UNK , of course .
And maybe it 'll be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to replace a few weeks .
And there 's a few months .
And what 's beautiful in this picture is that you have to deal with your hands by hand , or a little bit of color , and then the color in the back of the water that 's going on in the water .
The whole process is very efficient .
All of these things that have happened to be in the UNK , in the UNK , sometimes in the trash , sometimes in the trash , sometimes in the trash , and all of these are going to be going to destroy these pictures , and all of this is going to be the UNK part of the project , and all of this stuff is going on in a very large part of this project , which is a major part of the project that 's going to destroy these pictures , and so it 's a big part of the project that 's going to destroy these pictures , and so it 's going to be a major part of the project that 's going to destroy these pictures , and then it 's a big part of the project that 's going to destroy these pictures , and then it 's a big part of the project that 's going to destroy these pictures , and then it 's a big part of the project that 's going to destroy these pictures , and then it 's a big part of the project that 's going
And if these pictures don 't want to be clean , we can 't be able to fix it , that they have to be able to fix it , to go ahead and get it right .
And we can do it very well .
There 's a woman 's office , right ?
And these pictures are easy to hurt .
And as I said , I mean , it 's like UNK .
You can 't have a UNK , you can make a mess .
And this is a very lucky woman for us all of these pictures .
And she also started to UNK her , until she realized that she was going to be more UNK in her body .
Okay , but she 's got a picture of this picture .
And on the picture , she can 't be UNK without any of the faces , and so we 'll be able to pull all of this stuff into a good image , and then we 'll pull all of these parts together .
When she came from one of these pictures , she told us the story of some of these pictures .
And what she found out was that in my husband , she found out that there was a lot of money in the ground in the back of the road in the neighborhood in the neighborhood , and they found that it was far away from the house , and they found him very far .
And on the end of the tsunami , he 's got to make sure that the tsunami is turning off the door to shut down .
He had to jump to the tsunami .
And then , two sons her son , UNK , UNK and UNK in two different schools .
And one of the kids in this school was destroyed by the tsunami .
And she spent a long week of walking on a week , and they were all UNK .
And we gave her our UNK , and it was the death of my son , and she was 14 .
And to her son , despite all of the UNK and UNK of his son , these pictures allow him to be UNK , UNK , that never changed the first day after the three months of my life , or what he 's going to change , or one of the things that happened in his life , or that is destroyed .
And in Japan , six months after Japan , " UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK in Japan , hundreds of millions of people in Japan who had a lot of money , a few of these things .
Most of the end comes back in time , and that 's a very important thing .
There 's more than 500 of them in 500 of these experiments for the last three and a half thousand photos , these pictures are UNK .
And in this time , we didn 't take a lot of equipment or materials for a device or materials .
We 've been walking out of these days .
And this is a UNK and UNK , to some of us , to some place , to some place , to find out , to find out , to find out and to find out .
They help us record , UNK and our past , our past , our most likely to be UNK , but sometimes we 're going to get back .
And that 's what this project is all about to the UNK of human nature , UNK and UNK people in the past .
And when this picture goes back to his owner , it creates a very different difference , a big difference in life life .
And it 's the project that we 've come up with this project .
And one of the things that came up with some of the images in this is to connect a little bit about something that we do , as a feedback society , to control their skills , to control their skills , to control the UNK model of UNK and UNK models of UNK and UNK .
And I wanted to leave you with one email email , from six or six months from my Japanese home home .
" When I was working on those pictures , I wanted to think of all of those people in this photograph .
And one of the young women in the age , on the third of the ages , the UNK and the UNK , my grandmother , my grandmother and my mother and my mother and my mother and I was born in my house .
The global world , beyond the age of age , is something that we have the most fundamental needs of UNK , not sustainable ? "
Thank you very much .
Today , I wanted to talk about a UNK question , the answer to this question .
And what I 'm going to talk about is the secret of violence , and I 'm going to answer this question : " Why is that ? "
" How would you have to be willing to continue with her man with this man ? "
I was not a UNK , social worker , not a UNK .
I 'm just a woman who 's got to talk about .
I was 22 years old when I was in Harvard .
And I moved to New York , and I started working on my first job in " The Guardian , " at the UNK .
The first time I had my house , I had the first card . I had a very big secret .
And the secret was I was , I was thought to be the men in my soul and UNK on my head as well as many times .
And this one I used to be my favorite man , and I used to leave my head with a gun , and to kill me , and I 've heard how many times I 've ever done .
And what I 'm talking about here is the story of love , which is one of the UNK UNK of a UNK man who has millions of women in a year , even though a male will die in this UNK every year .
And maybe it 's happening here .
I don 't look like a typical family .
I had the UNK Institute of Harvard College in Harvard , and then went to the U.N. School of commercial school in commercial school .
And I 've spent most of my time working with wealth companies , including UNK , UNK and Washington UNK .
And my next day , my next husband , I was about 20 or three kids in my day .
I saved a black and UNK , UNK UNK in UNK .
And that 's what I 'm going to tell you about , is that what 's going to happen is that your race is not about to say , you know , your race , your UNK , income and education levels .
It 's everywhere .
The second thing that I wanted to talk about is how many of you think that there are women 's lives in women 's lives in women .
No , no .
More than 70 percent of the women 's population , and UNK is in a UNK , UNK , UNK , in other words , in the family of one of us , not the most likely that we don 't want to be , or one of the most of the things that we don 't want to see in the family , and that 's one of the reasons that it 's true .
And I thought I had a single person in the world that was going to stay in front of a UNK man , but in fact it was very common .
And I was 22 , and 16 and a half of the women in the United States is much more likely to die than the United States and the United States , and one year , two women , or girls , died , or a husband , or a husband , or a husband , or a husband .
I was a very typical victim , because I had nothing to do with my poor UNK and development patterns .
I met UNK in a UNK , and then , at the end of the year , it was cold .
We ended up in New York City before I was here .
And he told me two things .
And the first one is that he also graduated from UNK school , and it was working in a very good Wall Street banks .
But the first time to meet my most UNK was to humor and humor , and his UNK look like a farm boy .
His face is like a big UNK of UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK .
And one of the things that happened in the first place to do that , to be able to believe that I believe in that respect , I 'm a UNK .
And when I was beginning , he was thought I was a hero .
And we started to see what he wanted to say to my UNK , for example , my love , my career from Harvard , and my job from Harvard and my job .
He wanted to know my family , my childhood , my wish and dream .
And Dr. UNK , as I was , as a woman and a woman , no one had ever been there before anybody .
And he had a strange UNK of UNK in our UNK , and he told me , from the UNK of his UNK in the UNK of his UNK , he had to do that he had to be able to leave him when he got eight , he had to get his life out at eight o 'clock at the time he 'd be able to get his life , even though he 'd been able to rebuild his life .
And this is the reason why UNK 's work in the Wall Street in Wall Street , for the most important , to be a significant part of the Internet .
And if there were somebody that I was talking about this , it had to be one of my men and my UNK and my UNK , and my friends in my life would be able to help you , because I couldn 't see what to do , because I couldn 't see if I had a little bit of violence or control or whatever .
And then I had no idea of UNK and UNK , my first step in North America .
And I had no idea that the next step was isolated .
And instead of going back home , but one of the things that I 'm going to leave you with , but we 're going to get into your house , and I want you to be able to leave you with one of the things that you can 't leave with your neighbors , and then I 'll leave you with your neighbor and say , " I want you to leave out of your friends , family and colleagues , and they 'll see you in your friends and family and colleagues and colleagues , and they 'll see you . "
And the fact that , when he was working on a Friday night , and he told me , he was , he told me that he had the UNK and the security he had , and he said he had to leave the city , and then he wanted to leave you with the city , and he wanted to leave you with the city , and that 's what he wanted to do : to leave this city , to leave the city , to leave the city , to leave the city , to go to the UNK family and to get the new life in New England and then I was working on a new life and my life in New York City and my house in New York City and my house in New York City and my house in New York City , where I started working in New York City and my house in New York City , where I started working in New York City and my house in New York City , where I started working in New York City and my house in New York City and my house in
And at the time I had to leave in New York to leave in New York , but to my soul , I thought I needed to get my own , and then I said , I had to quit , and I said , I agreed , I agreed , I agreed , I agreed , I agreed , I agreed , I agreed , I agreed , I agreed , I agreed , I agreed , I agreed , I agreed , I agreed , I agreed , I agreed , I agreed , I agreed , I agreed , I agreed , I agreed , I agreed , I agreed , I agreed , I agreed , I agreed , I agreed , I agreed , I agreed , I agreed , I agreed , I agreed , I agreed , I agreed , I agreed , I agreed , I agreed , I agreed , I agreed , I agreed , I agreed , I agreed , I agreed , I agreed , I agreed , I agreed , I agreed , I agreed , I agreed , I agreed , I agreed , and I
And I thought that myself had a crazy love , not knowing that I had the UNK control of your body , my mind , your mind and the economy .
And the third stage in North America is to start with violence on violence and looking at what she 's going on .
This is what it was like .
We just moved to the New York City town -- I think , " UNK " is safe -- he bought three guns .
A UNK in your car .
You put it on a bed , and then the third half is in my pocket .
And he was the man who told me that he had to be able to have these guns .
And let him be secure .
The gun for me was an obvious signal , even though he didn 't get the gun , I had no idea of no evil edge .
The first UNK was in my wedding five days earlier .
It was in the morning , and I was wearing UNK .
And I was working on a computer , and when I had a UNK , my neck , my neck , my neck in my neck , my neck in my neck , my neck in my neck , my neck in my neck , my neck in my neck , had to breathe in my neck , with my neck in my neck , to put in my neck in my neck , to the wall in my neck , to the wall in my neck , to the wall in my neck , to the wall in my neck , to the wall in my neck , to the wall in my neck , to the wall in my neck , to the wall in my neck , to the wall in my neck , to the wall in my neck , to the wall in my neck , to the wall in my neck , to the wall in my neck , to the wall in my neck , to the wall in my neck , to the wall in my neck , to the wall in my neck , to the wall in my neck ,
And then five days later , I was wearing my mom 's house , and I sat in my mom 's house , and I was married .
And although those things happen , I believe that we can be happy life , because we 're so passionate about that love .
He wrote his own UNK .
He 's too much of stress too much , my mother and my family had to come out with me .
It was an accident , and he would never hurt .
And then I had two times when I was finished .
And on the first time , I was going to be looking for the secret of my secret , and I had lost my UNK in my head , and I had the shake of my head going on my head with my head and UNK the glass of my head .
And no one of the things that happened in my day when I was running out of my car in my car to take a long time to drive home in my face in my face , in my face , in my face , in my face .
And then I had half a year after three and a half years of my week and two and a half years .
I was one of those things that happened in my life .
In fact , every three American women in women who had a nation of violence , or the potential of UNK , is the child of 15 million children who had killed every year .
So in fact , I 'm not alone .
Go back to my question : Why did I stay ?
And the answer is simple .
And I didn 't know that he was taking care of me .
And even though he had the gun in UNK in my head , to UNK my dog , to the secret of my dog , on the highway on my head , I never thought I had to be a UNK wife in my face , and I never thought about myself to be a UNK wife , from my head , I had never thought of myself to be a UNK wife .
And on the contrary , I was a very UNK man called the UNK man , and I was the only person who can help him meet the man 's lives in the world .
The other question that you wanted to ask was , " Why did not leave ?
Why not ? I 've got a lot of opportunities .
And for me , this is the most exciting thing that people ask me , but it 's the only thing that you can 't understand , but only one of the victims that we leave with when we leave it .
The last step in the family was killed .
And more than 70 percent of the family of UNK died in the victims of the victims of the victim , when she left , it was UNK .
And the other thing that may include a long-term track , even though it 's time to protect the economy , to protect the economy , to protect the women , to protect the victims of the victims of the victims of the victims of the woman and the women and the children who are going to be able to be able to support the women and the women and the women and the women who are going to be able to do that .
Now we still ask , well , why is she not ?
And I decided to leave because it was the last time I was going to leave with the limits of my UNK .
And I realized that if I was not in denial , this man had killed me .
So I broke silence .
And I was going to leave you with the police , neighbors , neighbors , my friends , my friends , my family , my family , all my friends , and today I can stand here , because every one of you will be here today .
We tend to represent the victims of UNK and UNK and UNK of all of the headlines that are afraid of the news .
" Why is she left ? "
The guy who was really saying it was , " This is her own UNK , it 's the victims of the identity and the UNK and the men that they love to be .
And so many men and women and women have come to their stories , and many men and women come to school , and they started to tell people , and they came to school 's time in the middle of their lifetime , and they began to talk about their lives -- the happy life , my wife , my wife , my wife , my mother , my mother , my mother and my mother and my mother and my mother and my mother and my mother and my mother and my mother and my mother and my mother and my mother and my mother and my mother and my mother and my mother and my mother and my mother and my mother and my mother and my mother and my mother and my mother and my mother and my mother and my mother and my mother and my mother and my mother and my mother and my mother and my mother and my mother and my mother and my mother and my mother and my mother and my mother and my mother and my mother and my mother and my mother and my mother and my mother
In fact , I was a classic family , a typical family survivor .
And then I was married with a UNK , and I had three kids .
I saved a black and UNK , UNK UNK in UNK .
And I was never going to have to be able to have a UNK that loved my mind with my own UNK .
At this moment , you may be wondering , wow , or " Oh , but in the process , in fact , I 'm talking about you .
And I assure you , now there are some of you who are told that there are some of you who are suffering , or you 're a UNK , or you are a UNK .
UNK may be happening in your daughters , in your sisters , to your sisters .
And I was able to finish with my story , " I can finish my story . "
And I 'm still on a silence .
This is the way I helped other victims of other victims , and it 's the last request for you .
Tell people what you 're today .
UNK only live in silence .
You have the ability to stop the family in order to light light .
We 're victims of all of us .
We need you to understand the secret of violence .
And your kids , your colleagues , your friends and family -- it 's going to be UNK .
It 's time to help be the good and the lovely and the good and the future .
And what was happening is that what is the UNK of the violence and UNK of loss , reducing the possibilities of the victims of the victims of the victims .
Let 's say our bed , our bed and our family is to be safe and peace as we should be .
Thank you .
When I was a kid , I thought that my country was the best of the world , and one of my big UNK is the song called UNK UNK .
And I think it 's proud .
In school , we use a lot of time to study UNK history , but we 've never seen any of the outside of the outside of the outside world , except for America and Japan , Japan and Japan .
And although I was waiting outside of the world , I thought I was in North Korea in my life until all of the things that had happened in my lifetime .
When I was seven and I was in my third UNK , but I thought I was normal in North Korea .
And my family was not poor . And I had never had a parent in my life .
But one day , my mom took a letter from my mom to come home from her colleagues .
And it says , " When you read this letter , I had five people in my house , because we 've spent less than two weeks in less than two weeks .
We 're standing on the floor , and our bodies are too hungry and ready for UNK . "
I was really surprised at that time .
And that was the first time I had to be living in my country .
And after that , when I was walking in a bus , I saw a very frustrating thing to get me down .
A UNK woman is lying on the ground , but one of the kids on the left hand , the child still UNK the face of his mother .
But nobody helped them , because you don 't have to be UNK with your family .
In the ' 90s , North Korea had a big famine .
And unfortunately , more than a million or 60 percent of the time is killed in famine , and a lot of HIV is about to eat , UNK and UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK ,
The power is going to be the same as well that the rest of the night is dark , except for the Chinese UNK in China , that 's just the river in my house .
And I was always thinking about how they had a UNK , and we didn 't .
This is a satellite graph taken in front of the winter and the UNK .
This is a part of the Chinese and North America .
And as you can see , it 's very UNK in some places where there 's a place in North America to get back to China .
But there are many people who tried to die .
And sometimes I saw the body UNK in the UNK .
And I couldn 't get too much left in North Korea , but I had to say that it was one of the most difficult things in famine , and I was sent back to China and UNK .
And then I thought I was a very short trip to my family .
But I 've never thought about 14 years from this experience of 14 years .
In China , I had a little girl from a small girls .
And I didn 't know that if I was living in a farm in North Korea , but I was able to realize that life was filled with , but it was very dangerous , because 60 percent of the women in China are considered the Chinese UNK in China .
So I was always living in fear , and I was afraid of my identity to be found , and I was going to go back to Korea , and then I was in North Korea to get the fear of fear .
And one day , my worst UNK became true when I was in China when I was to take the Chinese police and take back to the police .
Some of us were , I was the North , so the police test my UNK , and asked me a lot of questions .
And as I was in my mind , my mind was going to slow down my mind .
And if anybody ever had anything , I was going to go in and be sent back .
And I thought that in my life , although I was trying to hide my fear and worry , and answer their questions .
And then , one of the police said , " The report is wrong .
She 's not North Carolina . "
And then they put me out . It 's a miracle .
And some of the North countries go to UNK in China in China to go to bed , but many of them get to go back to North Korea .
These girls are lucky .
And even though they 're caught , but there 's a big international UNK pressure that 's going to be released .
But there are some bees who are lucky .
And many of the UNK of North America are arrested in China , back in North Korea , back in North Korea , when they were UNK or UNK or UNK or UNK .
And although I was lucky enough to leave in North Korea , I didn 't have a lot of UNK .
It 's a very tragic fact , and that is the UNK have to be able to be to survive , so that it 's just to be used to survive .
And even though they had to find Chinese , they found the world , and their entire world will be UNK in UNK .
And that 's why , in the last 10 years after 10 years , I decided to go to Korea , and then , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again .
And in Korea , it 's much more difficult than my imagination than I was trying to do .
English was too important in Korea , so I had to start studying the third door -- English .
And as you know , Korea had a big difference between Korea and North Korea .
And despite all of us , we 're all UNK , but our bodies have become very different , UNK , UNK UNK .
And I even experienced that identity .
I 'm Korea , or is Korea ?
Where do I come from ? Who ?
And all of a sudden I was unable to call the country as my own country .
And although it 's not just about Korea , it 's not just the same thing , but I decided to go .
Go ahead of college .
And just before I started out in a long time , I got a UNK call .
And then 60 government stopped in my lab home , as a punishment for punishment , my family had to be pushed back into a remote place in rural Africa .
They had to get ready , so I started to help them .
And North Korea is the path of freedom of freedom of freedom .
If you think about UNK in North Korea and Korea , it 's almost impossible , it 's like I 'm sitting in China in China and then back to the border of the border .
Because my family had no Chinese , so I had to help them in about 2,000 kilometers in the Chinese in China in Asia .
We 've got a week in the bus for about a week in the bus .
And again , we 're sitting in a UNK with a Chinese officer .
And he 's looking for everybody 's UNK , and he started UNK .
Because my family doesn 't understand Chinese , and I was afraid they would be caught .
So when the Chinese officer went down to my UNK , I would stand up to tell him a couple of them , my name .
And he looked at me , but fortunately , he believed .
And that 's what we get here , but I 've got to get rid of all of my money to UNK the border of UNK .
And even though we had this one , my family was arrested in jail .
And after my family and UNK , my family after a month after my family was released , but it was caught in the capital of the UNK and the UNK .
And that 's one of the last moments of my life .
And I was able to get my family to free , to be able to do that , and family had to go to prison , and the prison was not going to be far away from North Korea .
And I was working with my police and the police and the UNK , and all of my UNK and I had spent my money , but I had no idea of money to cook or save the whole thing .
I 'm UNK .
And at that point , I heard one man asked me , " What ? "
And I was , of course , a complete stranger with all of these strangers .
And I used to say that in my UNK English and UNK on the other hand , but that guy goes to the UNK machine , for my family and the other UNK in my family and the other UNK .
And I was grateful for him , and I said , " Why are you going to help me ? "
" I 'm not helping you , " he said .
" I 'm working for Korea . "
And that 's when I realized that that was the kind of symbol of my life .
And that 's the UNK of my doctor 's favorite of my hometown , and he 's going to be sure that strangers and international society are truly UNK and international and international and international social support that we have hope that we need .
And then finally , after a long journey , my family and I was in Korea , but the freedom of it was to win half the war .
Many North and their families , and when they come to the next country , they 're usually less expensive , or a UNK .
So we can help from the international society to accept education , English training , job and work .
We can be able to be able to communicate with the world in North Korea , because we all live in the family of North Korea , and all of us had to go back and get back and money on my family and the money that we got back in .
And I was lucky , and there was so much help in my life , and so I wanted to help people who dream in international aid , one of the three things that had dreams .
And I had to say that you 'll be able to see more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more about this stage here .
Thank you .
You may be sure that that 's good .
It 's a UNK , it 's a very good material , it 's going to be good , but it 's not always like this -- it 's like today , it 's like this .
And in the UNK , they 're going to be frozen .
Especially if you 're on a bike , with those cars , it 's not very good .
And at the same time , it 's going to get a lot of noise .
And there 's something that you can do , if we 're going to build cities in cities , like the UNK of the Netherlands , we hope to be small .
And the solution is to get rid of a UNK UNK .
The UNK of this material is in the middle of the Netherlands , and it 's got a little UNK of water in the middle of the middle of the ocean where there 's oil in the end of the road in order to go in and off the road , or in the end of the road , without UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK ,
The noise will disappear in these types .
Because it 's got a lot of UNK , and there 's a lot of UNK , and it 's quiet .
And of course , it 's got the UNK , the UNK of that path is going to be UNK out .
What 's called the UNK ? Look at the rock in the UNK UNK .
And starting a little bit , then a couple of months , and then , I can 't show you .
But they 're going to kill your UNK . You don 't want to be happy .
And finally , there will be a lot of damage .
And sometimes that 's going to happen .
Ah , he 's UNK .
And you know , of course , of course , of course , but we have a solution .
And what you see here is the damage that you see in this material .
This is the UNK , as I said , rock in the middle .
And because of the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , is going into the UNK line , from UNK to UNK .
And if you drive in this road , you 'll take these things that we 're looking at .
And in order to do that , we think about UNK materials .
And if we can fix that material , it may be the solution .
So what we use is the UNK UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , we 'll take these little UNK .
So now there 's a little UNK in there .
You need to have a machine like that , a UNK engine -- it can be cook for cooking .
UNK can be hot . It 's very good for steel .
So what we 're going to do is we take a steel and we 'll cut it down in the air , and then it 'll be cut down into those little lights .
And it was too big to be able to do that , because I 'm going to show you here here .
And that 's the idea of UNK UNK .
And I put a sample on it , and now , look at what happens .
This is what a UNK looks like .
We 've got a UNK machine in our lab in the lab .
And we tested many samples , and government was looking at our results , and they decided , " That 's interesting , we should try . "
The government gave up a UNK , and we had to do this for about 400 meters in UNK , and we 're doing a lot of materials here .
And that 's what we do . You see , you see a few years of work , and , of course , that 's going to be bad for a few years .
We 've done a lot of samples in the lab in the lab .
And we 've done some of these things , and we 've added a lot of these UNK , and we cut them off , and they heat up and UNK and testing .
We can do that again .
In fact , what this experiment was that if we weren 't using a hot machine in this road -- we wanted to use this machine in order to use this machine , and we 're going to take a lot of money in this room , of course , and the amount of money that 's going on in this room is , of course , a lot of money , of course , is there 's a lot of money that 's going on in this room , and that 's going to be much more money .
So , the conclusion is that we 've created a material that 's used to steel fibers , to use a UNK of UNK in order to be able to get more money from this simple technology , which is going to be the same amount of money that 's going to be saved by the speed of the road , which is going to be that much more money .
You 're curious about it .
We 're looking at this sample . Now there 's a UNK .
And in fact , I 'm going to do that , and I 'm going to do that , and it 's going to be able to replicate it with your UNK .
But think about that .
You know , it 's really cool .
Thank you .
I wanted to talk to you about a very unusual animal .
There are 10,000 birds in the planet .
UNK is one of the most UNK .
And every time you saw a UNK , like this , it 's a UNK of UNK , UNK , UNK UNK , allowing people to believe that .
And I wanted to change that , and I wanted to change the bad ideas of people , because they need to be compassionate . They really need to be .
Let me tell you why .
First of all , why did they leave us the bad idea ?
Charles Charles Darwin had found in the journey of the Atlantic Ocean on the Atlantic Ocean , and he said , " These are the UNK and UNK birds in UNK in the UNK UNK .
You know , you 're very difficult to find something that 's bad than that , and that 's what Charles Darwin said .
You know , Darwin went back to the United States , and I 'll tell you why .
The UNK had been UNK -- it was like a UNK dog , a UNK , UNK character .
And recently , if you 've seen the news from Kenya -- Kenya , Congress are UNK by UNK and UNK , but I think it 's cool .
I want to question it . You know why ?
Because Congress couldn 't keep the natural clean clean .
You can 't prevent the disease of the disease .
There 's almost nothing left left .
They 're far away from the extinct .
And this , my favorite , is much better than the UNK .
There are two main UNK in the world .
The UNK of the city is growing in the UNK of the United States , like the UNK and UNK , where there are 16 UNK , there are 16 diseases where there 's the risk of loss of death .
So why do you know that ? Well , first of all , you know , the first thing that 's going on in the atmosphere is absolutely critical .
The UNK is our nature of natural gas .
And then they eat UNK UNK in the body .
They can be able to kill all of these bodies , and they can be able to absorb the spread of the viruses that can prevent viruses into the viruses of UNK and animals from the disease and the disease .
And one of the recent studies that happened in those places in those places in those places don 't have three times more of the UNK of living is three times as much as the UNK of the disease , the UNK and the spread of the disease .
There 's a lot of history in the history of history .
They have a deep connection with the UNK .
The UNK UNK in the ancient culture of UNK and UNK and UNK and UNK and UNK UNK and UNK and UNK in Egypt .
In the UNK , UNK UNK was the UNK of the UNK , UNK UNK in the UNK of UNK UNK in the first UNK of UNK .
In Tibet culture , especially UNK UNK , where these things in Tibet , there 's no UNK , there 's no UNK , there 's a natural body , there 's a natural body .
So where 's the problem ?
Kenya grew up in eight UNK , six of them are UNK .
And many of the UNK , UNK is because of the human and wildlife that we 've been living in Africa , where there 's a UNK that can be used in the UNK of UNK animals , UNK animals , and then they become a victim .
In South Asia , there are parts of the South and Pakistan in India and Pakistan , which means that they 're going to be extinct in the next 15 and 15 years , and that means that the UNK of those of you who have lost the amount of money that they killed in the next 15 or 15 years .
Now there 's UNK UNK right now in India , in India , in India .
Because the number of UNK in the UNK UNK in the UNK UNK in the UNK UNK in the UNK , UNK UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK in the UNK of the Indian UNK , UNK UNK , where there 's a dramatic growth in UNK in the UNK UNK in India .
Kenya is going to be the largest wind in Africa : the UNK of UNK : the UNK of the UNK UNK in the UNK UNK .
And I don 't want to develop wind , but we should be able to ask government to think about that , because the amount of opportunity for birds in the wind is going to be threatened by the wind in the wind in the UNK UNK will be two and a half a half .
It 's a bird bird .
In West Africa , some of these UNK UNK UNK were UNK UNK of UNK and UNK .
So what are we doing ? We are studying these UNK . We 're doing these UNK .
We 're trying to figure out what 's going on in the environment .
We find out that they 're traveling in different countries , so if you 're looking for a place , you 're difficult to figure out what 's going on .
We need to be working with the government of government .
We 're trying to communicate with local people .
We 're trying to figure out how they know about UNK , and how they 're going to be grateful for all of this amazing creatures and what they do .
And what you can do something , you can do it , and then , you can write to your government and tell them , we need to be able to focus on these UNK organisms , and we 're going to try to focus on those of you who don 't know what you 're doing .
When you walk in this room , you 're UNK , and you tell you what your family is , and what you 're telling you about , is that your neighbors are going to tell you about what your neighbors are .
And they were kind of cool . Charles Darwin had said that he had to change his mind , and he saw UNK in the air and then on the sky .
Kenya , the world , is going to have a lot of loss of loss of loss of species in the world .
Thank you very much .
And we are able to help ourselves in a lot of ways that we can use life to make life better .
We can 't be able to meet our neighbors , even when we live in the same quality of public spaces in the same way .
So in the last couple of years , I tried to UNK in different ways of using different forms of UNK , UNK and paintings that we share in public spaces in public spaces .
And these projects came from my own questions , as my neighbors , how much money would pay for my neighbors ?
How can we get from one of the neighborhoods in the neighborhood and not be able to resist the door ?
How can we be able to share a better story about the building in the destruction of the destruction of the destruction of the destruction of our lives ?
How can we say that we 're going to be able to express our communities and give us the support of what we need and dream and dream ?
I was born in New Orleans and deep in this city .
The big UNK of those things that are going to leave my soul and UNK and UNK and UNK and UNK and UNK and UNK and all of you , I 'm sure that this is the city that I love to love to the city in my life , and I believe that this is the city of music that I love to live in my life .
And every time I feel , I feel like that , New Orleans , I feel that we all come up with a UNK team .
New Orleans , many beautiful buildings in the world , but at the same time , she 's the most UNK city in the city .
And I was in the house here , and I wanted to get it in this neighborhood , and one of the other things that happened in this neighborhood was completely changed my life .
In 2009 , I lost one of my love .
Her name is UNK , and she was like my mother , just like my mother .
And then I thought a lot about death of death , and this thing led me to be the same thing that my life and my life is absolutely UNK in my life .
But it was difficult to keep in my daily life .
I think it 's easy to be easy to forget what 's really important in front of these things .
And I was working on a big wall with a big wall in my house , and I wrote a big UNK on top of the same boat that I had , and every single hour of my body could be able to leave with one of these things that I could leave in my UNK and share a little bit of that they had all of these things that were going to be able to share the way that they had in my life , and then they would be able to share their minds to share the wish of their lives in the future .
And I didn 't know what to expect from this experiment , but the next day , all the walls had been UNK , and there was a new answer to this .
And I wanted to share with you all of you in this wall .
" Before my death , I wanted to get my UNK behavior . "
" Before you die before , I wanted to go on to the International date . "
" Before you die , I wanted to sing in a million audience . "
" Before you die , I wanted to think of a tree . "
" Before I had died before I had a UNK life . "
" Before you die before , I wanted to hold it again . "
" Before you die , I wanted to be a UNK . "
" Before you die before , I wanted to do the actual real self . "
This was the UNK building , which was the hope of a very UNK place , that would be the hope of all of these things , and the dream that I was going to leave with my dream , and I was told to leave you with my life and my dream .
And that made us believe that we are not alone .
Let 's know something about the neighbors .
And this is the space that we 've created for us and thinking about what 's going on in the process that we 're growing in .
And that 's what I did last year , and then I got a lot of passionate about this wall , so that my colleagues and my colleagues made a small UNK now , and then my colleagues and then , my colleagues in this wall , there 's UNK , there 's UNK in South Africa , in South Africa .
And what that means is that , if we can have a decision to be able to share a chance to connect and share with you , that 's the opportunity of public spaces .
And one of the most valuable things we have , one is time time and time , one is the connection between others .
And in this UNK era , in this case , to leave themselves , to be able to remember the long and life of life and life , it becomes more important than ever before .
We all have no courage to talk about death and death without fear of death , but I realize it 's the most powerful thing we can do .
And think of death as death can allow you to be familiar with your own lives .
The public spaces can be much more important for what we are , or for the entire community , or to be able to share the hope that we want to help us to help ourselves to help us to create better places in our lives , to help us to create better lives better and to help us better lives .
Thank you .
Thank you .
I was in Ghana in a UNK in Ghana .
The air UNK in the air , is difficult to breathe .
And I was able to feel that the people in the UNK UNK from me , but in a dark , I couldn 't see anything else .
And I heard people talk about people , but more or less UNK , my UNK , my UNK , is used to be the UNK of a UNK device .
In other words , my head on one of these lights , when I was on a hot light on my head , I was wearing all my UNK in my UNK UNK in my neck , and I had my UNK UNK on the wall of the wall , and I had the UNK on the wall of the wall , and then I had bought hundreds of kilometers of light into the wall , and one of these meters hundreds of meters of light back into a meter of a mile and a half meters of water .
And then one of my hands came up with one of the founders of my hand , and he thought about it , he had the UNK UNK on the back of my day .
And when I stand here today with your talk today , these crazy work in this field of life without life , without any of money , without any money .
And I ended up in my last four and a half of my UNK 's life would never go home .
And in the last 28 years , I 've been working on my last three and a half of the country 's UNK in 2009 , in 2009 , and I was very fortunate to be in UNK and UNK in UNK .
And there I met a lot of amazing people in this room who I met a UNK organization called UNK , which is this UNK of UNK UNK of modern society .
And we talked about that at the end of this time , and when I started to really understand what it was , I 've been told that I 've been told by the fact that there are three billion of the world that I 've been told to do , but it 's no longer known as well as possible .
And on the end of our talk , I felt bad and UNK the UNK of my UNK , UNK , UNK that I had no idea , how many of you ?
And that idea led me to my last week , and then I flew in Los Angeles to see the director of the UNK UNK organization that wanted to be able to do something .
And it started my journey in modern history .
And the weird thing is , I 've been here .
Some of them were the second from my second .
But this time , I 'm going to get to dig up the secret of a UNK .
UNK estimates that there 's more than a million people in the world today .
This number is two times the size of the UNK trade trade in Africa .
150 years ago , one of the price of a UNK price on the United States is three times more likely to be UNK .
It 's about 50,000 dollars a year .
But in today , the entire family of a generation of generations is to be 18 billion dollars a year .
And what was amazing was that , after all , the UNK of the global population had over two billion dollars a year .
And many of you know that , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you
Today , it 's about commercial work for commercial work , but creating value , but by creating value you are .
There is almost every corner of every corner in the world , even though it 's illegal .
In India and Nepal , I was brought into UNK .
And it 's a very strange feeling that feels like walking in Egypt and UNK .
And then , men , men , women , women , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , and then on top of each of those on the top of the ground , they go through a UNK , and then they go through a few kilometers away from each of these UNK .
UNK and UNK were quiet , and they were quiet , and again , over and over and over again , a half a day .
You can 't eat , you can 't eat , can 't eat , can 't eat , they don 't need a toilet , they don 't need a toilet , they don 't need a toilet .
And because of the UNK and UNK of my camera , I couldn 't do that .
And every 20 minutes , I had to go in my UNK with my device , and then it opens up at the air in the air and turn it into the air , which is , I think , in my car , it 's much better than what you 're looking at .
And then back to UNK , I was going to try to cry , and so on and so forth , I said , " UNK , don 't be crying here . "
And then he explained to me in this place where they are dangerous , not only for me , is dangerous for what these workers are .
I didn 't have to give them any direct help .
I couldn 't give them money . I 'll give them .
I 'm not the citizen of that country .
And it 's possible that I think it 's going to make them worse than it 's now .
And I would only expect to be the UNK organization in the system , and I believe that they can do that .
And for me , I had to go back and get home .
In the Himalayas , I saw a UNK kid in my UNK UNK in the sand and then on the back of the side of the road .
And the kids on the left hand would have spent the kids working on the branches , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK
And you can see that the scene is a very painful thing .
How can we treat these hidden things , but are the common UNK ?
Some people don 't even think they 're working on UNK because they 're born in a daily day , but they 're born like this .
There 's nothing more .
And if these people are going to be free for themselves , they burn up their house .
And they were scared , and they wanted to give up , and this woman UNK in local UNK in the middle of the country , and they went to the UNK UNK , and then they had to go back to the same UNK , but now I could go for it , and then I had to go back to the same UNK , but now I had to go back to the UNK , and then I had to go back to them , and then they had the freedom of the freedom to get the freedom of it .
And as soon as a result of that , as we heard earlier , my most often thought was , " You know , when I insisted that there 's no money for this industry , I 'm going to be able to get rid of this . "
In my UNK , I had the women in UNK in my UNK .
And they took me in a UNK with a UNK UNK in a UNK .
It 's not a UNK .
It 's more like a restaurant .
The UNK is in front of the UNK and UNK of UNK .
The UNK , the women and children , had a lot of women who are going to ask you to get less food and drink a lot .
And each of these UNK is the dark side of the wall , which is the number of UNK UNK on three UNK and UNK .
The people who work in that work are usually UNK UNK .
And remember that I was standing in a dark , and I had a strong fear of fear that I was thinking that was going to be UNK in this face .
There 's just one more .
There was no instructions .
There 's no windows .
And that 's completely impossible to get away from this difficult subject to us , that there 's a lot of trouble , including UNK , including in our backyard , in the same place in our backyard .
Hundreds of people became UNK , family UNK , family UNK .
And recently , New York Times came out of about 60 million dollars a year in the United States two year .
And that 's happening in all of us . We just don 't know .
The industry is the same thing that we 've heard about when we hear about UNK .
I was in India in India in a village called UNK .
This is a man 's name .
And these were the white blue blue and the red blue and the red line .
They 're UNK in a gas in their UNK , and then UNK it in UNK , until it 's toxic to get rid of all of these things that are toxic .
Show me their story .
" We didn 't have a UNK , they said .
" We are hope , we can get rid of this room where we can get paid . "
It 's estimated that there 's more than 4,000 of children in UNK in the world where there 's the largest UNK of the world .
And we 'll go there . I 'll see it .
And I was looking at a family that had two brothers , a few UNK , a few UNK , a few tiny little kids .
UNK ! They 're HIV-positive .
Children are being sold in their homes , but they 're working in their UNK and they 're not going to swim .
This boy is eight years old .
And when our boat came close , he was overwhelmed with his boat , and he was stuck with his UNK .
He was afraid of UNK .
The UNK of the trees in the UNK are often going to get rid of these UNK and fear of parents to stop in the water .
Many of you suffer .
He 's been working on top of a long time , from his UNK .
He was very afraid to be , very afraid , when he had died , he had been treated with the same approach to take his money .
And when I was in the morning , I saw these boys at the end of these boys , and they started working on the top one .
That 's cold , UNK night .
You know , there 's a thousand pounds in which these UNK have fish .
And I want to introduce you to some of you .
He comes from a UNK .
You know , he 's a place in a hospital in a hospital called UNK UNK .
And one of the photos that he was working on was to UNK a UNK of water that is the last time with my family , and then they had to be able to do that to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do that , and to make sure that children are safe and to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do that .
There 's a possibility in UNK .
And because some of you have seen it , you know , you know , that 's going to change the future of his life , and that 's probably going to change the future of his life .
The car drive in Ghana 's office together with a UNK with a UNK , and then suddenly it 's going to go up and down to our cars , and then we go back to the door .
And he told us to go with a UNK and UNK .
And at the end of the road , he UNK us back to the driver .
And he said , and then he said , " That 's the road , right . Go ! "
And we had six hours of UNK in UNK in my UNK UNK , where I was able to take pictures of my UNK on the top of the water in a long way as soon as soon as possible as possible .
And then there was two hours of UNK , UNK , UNK UNK in front of us in front of the planet in front of the planet in front of the planet , and every single one of these things had been working on a UNK basis .
A lot of women are wearing their kids , and they 're walking in a hot water in a hot water .
And that 's what happens to be a UNK of gold .
These are people who are UNK in Ghana .
And when they walk into my house , they walk .
And I remember the eyes of all of these UNK UNK eyes , and many of you have been working on UNK .
There 's about 90 meters of sand in there , and then they get all of these UNK bags , and then they get up to another part of the UNK so that they 're UNK into the other area .
And on top of all the men in this room , the man 's UNK , but we are looking at the UNK workers in the edge , with autism and a young man .
They were victims of violence .
In fact , there was a few million of these muscles that would be used for this man , UNK and tuberculosis .
This is UNK . When his father died , his uncle took him in his house when he was working .
And he died in his uncle , UNK UNK in his uncle , and he was working on his uncle 's job , and he was working on his job .
And when I saw him , he had been working on a UNK photograph in his UNK UNK in a UNK , UNK UNK in my UNK , and my doctor would say , he was going to die .
And with this injury , he had breast cancer , even though he had been working on the road in the UNK job .
And even with that , he also dream of the ability to be able to be able to be able to support in this organization that the organization in this organization would have to be able to embrace education , to be able to figure out what to do with it , to be able to do that .
And I hope that we 'll give it to UNK .
And when I was in this painting , I took a lot of UNK in my UNK , and then I wanted to light their story and their UNK , when we were safe , when we were safe , I took this series of photos .
And they know that these images are visible .
And I wanted to make them know that we could change their lives in order to do that .
And I really believe that when we use them as individuals , they 're difficult to ignore these things .
And these images are not about the issue of the issues , but the real people , the same thing you 've ever experienced in your life , your dignity and respect and respect .
And I didn 't want these beautiful , but I was UNK by people who had nothing to do with people .
And I hope that this image is going to be a UNK in your ears , and I hope that the power of the power of that is to be the hope that we 're going to be the hope that we 're going to be the hope to be in the UNK of the UNK of the UNK in the UNK of the UNK so that it will continue to live in a UNK in the sky .
Thank you .
And in fact , one of the things that I 've learned from each other of you in this study is that there 's a special solution in every study that we are working with .
Nobody knows what we are .
So I 'll give you some examples of what we 're doing .
Well , dance is one of the many .
And we thought , well , let 's say we 're going to wake up good and UNK and UNK , and then you 'll know that you 're going to know .
There 's a significant professional knowledge of knowledge of knowledge and amazing skills , which may be the result of what you 're talking about .
But unfortunately , the nervous system , for example , UNK , is the UNK of my friend UNK , who was in my friend 's " UNK . "
There was a lot of progress in this year .
And yet , there 's UNK and UNK in the world , and they have to be UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , and so we need objective tools that we 're going to be able to detect .
We need to measure the basic progress of progress here to know when the only way to know when it 's the only way to know when we have that , to think about what is going to be the point of the question of the question of the question .
But what 's amazing about this is that , for instance , Parkinson 's disease and all kinds of UNK , there is no biological control , you can 't do a simple blood measure of what you can do , like this 20 minutes of imagination .
You 've got to go to the clinic , and it 's going to be large , and that means that in clinical trials , nobody never had ever done it , never before .
But what if anybody could do this test at home ?
And this can be saved for patients who are going to be able to save the next year , and if patients can be independent of this test ?
You don 't need a lot of money to hire employees .
And by the way , if there 's about 300 million dollars in this cost ?
And so I wanted to introduce you to an idea that we could try to get into a position , because you know , in a sense , in a certain sense , it 's the art of my friend ' UNK UNK .
And here 's a video from UNK .
This is a healthy person in the health care , and we think of ourselves as the sound of the sound of sound , because when we are grateful , we 've got to focus on these UNK organs , these are the UNK genes , for example , for example .
And as it 's , it needs to be trained .
And you can think about how much a child is , you know ?
And from sound , we can go from UNK UNK , and we can be able to influence ourselves , and it can affect us with our ears .
You can see that the bottom line of the bottom is a UNK UNK .
We 've seen the same symptoms .
UNK , UNK , UNK .
And it 's going to be UNK , and then it 's going to be the case of UNK sound .
And in fact , most of these things can be very easy , but only one of the three things that we have in the next digital computer system , we can be clear that we can be accurate and UNK , and that 's exactly what happens to be healthy and disease , and that is the only thing that 's going on right now .
And so with all these ideas , how are they going to work with their clinical trials ? In fact , they 're UNK technology .
UNK are UNK , and they are using the infrastructure .
You don 't need to design a whole new hospital to do this .
And they were all UNK . And although they said , well , it 's not the UNK test without any other .
And that means that the patient can do it .
And it 's going fast , it 's going to be 30 seconds .
The price is very low , and we know how to do it .
And once it 's cheaper , it can expand .
I 've got some good news here to get out right now .
We can reduce problems with the patient .
It was time to go to the clinic in the clinic .
And we can do this with a UNK search for UNK data .
We can do this in clinical trials in clinical trials , but we can also make the number of data on the first time in the first time .
We 've also been able to figure out that this disease is UNK in the early history of UNK .
So from now on this path , we 're beginning to UNK UNK in this direction .
And we 've got to work with UNK and UNK , and we 're going to take a lot of data out of the world , and then we 're going to get rid of these four targets here .
Our UNK number is the call on the Earth on the planet .
For any health or UNK , there 's enough money for everyone , and I 'm happy to say that we 're in eight hours in the next few hours .
Thank you .
UNK , UNK , by 10,000 , you can recognize who 's healthy , who is the risk of the disease ?
And what do you think about these things ?
Yes , yes , so what you 're doing here is , you should tell us if you 've got this disease . UNK : Well , yeah .
And you know , some of you wouldn 't call us , or we don 't .
But we 're going to get a lot of data from different environments , and the point is different environments , because we can eliminate the amount of UNK that we have in this case , is to try to figure out what these diseases are .
So what you have now is now , right now ?
It 's far beyond .
And in fact , my student UNK , and I had to ask him , because he 's got some good things here , and now that he 's seen that we can do this project , and now we 're looking for 99 percent of that right now .
Okay , okay , okay , that 's okay .
And so it means that people can go in your phone and do this test , and maybe you can get the phone in your phone , and then you can see if they 're going to be able to get the phone out , and then the doctors can see their progress , and they 're going to figure out what they 're in this disease .
That 's all .
Thank you , Scott and everybody .
Thank you .
And since I had a lot of camera , I 've been very excited about photography , but today I 'd like to share with you today about 15 of my most favorite pictures , and they didn 't just come up with me .
There 's no art , there 's no UNK , there 's no opportunity .
In fact , most of them are UNK .
And my story , one of my UNK , my wife , my wife , my wife , my daughter , my daughter of my daughter , who stood up at the time of my daughter , and we stood on the UNK of the UNK and the UNK of the New York Times .
And then one year later , we went back to New York City and then we decided to take a picture of the same picture .
You can guess what it 's about .
And when she got three or three , my wife said , " Hey , you don 't take the New York City , to get a man in New York , go to this small tradition ? "
And this is what we found out of the road in the back of the road .
You know , take a look at a completely stranger with a completely stranger .
Nobody won 't be , and fortunately , there 's no one of these cameras left our camera .
At that time , we didn 't know that journey would change our lives .
And it 's going to be sacred .
This is a few weeks after 9 / 11 , and I tried to explain what happened to the crash when I was trying to figure out what was going on about five .
So these pictures are much more than just recorded a moment or a special journey .
And they remember that in the last week at the end of this week , let 's think about how we 're going back and how we 're going on how we 're going to change the world , not just the UNK of the body , but it 's the change in which we live .
Because , when I took the same picture in every year , our eyes and her daughter came up and saw her eyes in the face of her eyes , looking at how she looked at her eyes and see how she 's going to see everything .
This is the time that we 've been working on for a year , and one of our most intelligent time in the year is one year .
And one of the last four things , we walked out in the road , and suddenly she stopped , she said , " You know , she said , " You know , the red thing that she 's wearing in my house is that she really liked it all the time . "
She told me when I was five and she stood on that photograph .
And she said she remembers the first time she saw that she was going to jump , that was nine years ago .
And now she 's looking at the University of New York City , because she decided to go to New York .
And I was surprised by the most important thing that we 've created .
And so I wanted to share with you that I wanted to be able to share the ideas that I wanted to create memory .
And I don 't know about you , but my personal , in this 15 years , I 'm not going to be here in a UNK photograph .
I was always able to take pictures of my camera .
And I wanted to encourage this to all of you here today , to go to this picture , don 't you know what to do with you , please , to get rid of them ? "
Thank you .
